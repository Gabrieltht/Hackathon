    "I’m 25F and I have around 25k of debt and I’m afraid I might have to drop school again because of money issues and I can’t do driving classes or even buying a car because of money issues. I also may have to move or find a roomate and so all my savings will go towards that. I see 30s year old people out of the blue having houses, condos, a car and all that grown up stuff and I’m like how did you do it ? People tell me just invest but where do I even start ? There are so many ways and so many financial institutions to invest in ? I’m from Canada and heard about the \" Bons de trésor\" something like that ? Knowledge is power and I will obviously improve my financial literacy but I feel like it might be too late. For context, I don’t have a single soul around me and had to cut contact with my family, also even I was in contact with them even asking for $1 is too much for my parents/siblings. My credit score is currently 625. It’s 100% my fault and I should have take care of my emotional needs instead of emotional eating and fucking up my financial situation/credit. Help. Anything. How did you get out of financial insecurity?\n",

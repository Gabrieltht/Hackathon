autism,DC1346,2019/01/01,"Do You Have the Ability to Hyper-Focus and if so, Is This Sometimes an Achilles Heel? I'm a 58 year old high school teacher on the spectrum. One of the advantages to my autism is that I'm extremely project oriented. Once started I like to work through a project from start to finish. During this time, my hyper focus allows me to fully concentrate my attention on the project at hand and I'm often oblivious to outside distractions.

A few days ago I got sidetracked with an e-book that I found absolutely engrossing. My hyper focus kicked in and 12 hours later when I finished reading, I noticed several things.

1. It was pitch black. The sun had set but since I had been reading on my kindle, I hadn't noticed.
2. My bladder was full and I needed instant relief. 
3. The elbow to the arm that had been supporting the kindle abruptly flared with pain. I had apparently been semi-reclined on the sofa, supported in part by a mound of pillows but holding the tablet upright at an angle for 12 hours apparently sprained something and I didn't notice until I snapped out of it.
4. It was FREEZING. I had opened the windows and front door to air out the house but hadn't shut them. Once the sun went down the temperature dropped pretty quickly and I never noticed. 
5. My poor cats were sitting around me in  a semi-circle on the floor. It was well past their dinner time. They moment I finished the book, I could hear their insistent meows. Since it was pitch black, I angled the tablet towards them and saw their eyes glowing in the reflected light.
6. When I tried to stand up, I found that one of my legs had fallen asleep. It was absolutely numb. Before I could relieve myself and feed the cats, I had to massage my leg to get the blood circulating again. It was hard to do this because my left arm was really hurting.

Has anything like this happened to any of you? Have you ever gotten so fixated on a project that you've lost track of time? Has your focus ever been so narrow that you've forgotten about hunger, using the bathroom, and other personal needs?

autism,GayMaryPoppins,2019/01/01,"Overcompensation by Proxy? Is that a thing? I know the title is a little weird, but here me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with Asperger's during the beginning of Middle school. During my late years in middle school, I started doing ... all sorts of things my mom wanted me to do: Voice lessons, because I had perfect pitch. Piano lessons, because I could play by ear. Theatre club, because of course she wanted me to socialize and make friends, when I had enough socialization by the end of the 6-hour day and just wanted to get home and get to sleep. She even signed me up for summer programs *without my consent or knowledge* just to make sure I was forced to seem ... normal. She seemed to make me do things I was super uncomfortable with, or else, just apathetic about. And of course I had no argument against her, because according to her, 'it was all good for me'.

I'm an adult now. I met with my brother recently, and I described this all to him. Something he said opened my eyes about everything she made me do during all my years of trying to act neurotypical.

He said, ""She was trying to overcompensate"". 

It's ... kinda saddening. That she was forcing me to overcompensate for the lack of social skills and processing issues I had. But I might just be over-reacting. But did anyone else get this kind of treatment? As much as I loved my mom, sometimes I just think about the things she did and what she should have done. Was anyone else forced to ... overcompensate?

autism,Justsofunny,2019/01/01,"So Scared My son is ten.  He has autism, anxiety, and is hypersensitive emotionally.

I feel so guilty.  He spends hours each day on his ipad, watching youtube.

I homeschool him, but it is often horrible and I dont know what to do.

I feel like I am failing him.

He has some activities outside the home, but mostly it is ipad.  

I have lost my temper with him often enough that he is scared of homeschooling.  

Will he be all right?",1.8508701472556872,4.297815987951807,3.2187148594377533,88.41179384203484,81.89156626506025,6.5804551539491305,22.475234270415,7.793537801064563,1.0662326639892905,329,11,69,6,9,107,57,83,0.266,0.7,0.034,-0.9691,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,2,4,6,1,2,1,0,13,0,0,0,1,14,17,6,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,4,4,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,5,0,1,1,3,12,1,4,14,5,4,0,2,1,0,10,2,0,4,3,48,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996100825386577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16827771307669792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3058070158792098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2935101692105238,0.0,0.2696095586335944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2638672325794542,0.18640783407879244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2617332083567164,0.0,0.25696264869163754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14339983478590074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12747680072289164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848349860888181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22283206503952327,0.0,0.0,0.52247118932002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,rbrownieboy,2019/01/01,"Answers for my possibly autistic fiance? My fiance and I met about two years ago. She has a lot of sensory problems such as, trouble with smells (sometimes they will make her gag), too loud of sounds that make her want to scream, she tends to choke when eating or even swallowing saliva. This happens almost daily. She severely dislikes tight clothes. (Jeans really frustrate her). She's very clumsy and tends to be disorganized and struggles with maintaining a household and struggles with simple household chores such as cooking, cleaning, etc. She used to meltdown very frequently but it has gotten better as time has move on. She sometimes struggles with communicating her thoughts (they often come out wrong.) For example, she will say one thing but really mean another) and recognizing social cues proves to be a challenge. As a child she was treated in occupational therapy for sensory issues but was never diagnosed. She likes to be squeezed and sometimes her skin hurts her when touched even lightly. We have obtained a lot of sensory toys that keep her occupied when she is stressed. She has a couple of comfort blankets that she takes with her everywhere she goes. I personally think that she might be on the high functioning side of autism given the symptoms. We are in the process of getting her tested for it. The first clinic said that they would send her to a specialist in another part of the state if they suspected a possibility of autism. They referred her to the specialist and we are currently waiting for the official diagnosis. She has a fascination with the medical field and researches constantly. She has never been able to uphold a job due to her meltdowns and the stress that is involved. At times it gets very difficult for me, but fortunately I have a very good job for my age so i am able to keep us afloat. If she is diagnosed, I personally think that disability will her best option to help cover her medical and basic necessities. She is 21 now. Have any of you had experience with this and do you have any tips for myself on how I can help her with day to day issues? My family has not been very supportive of me and seem to really dislike her as they do not understand her. They have actually separated themselves from me and her.  It's been a very rough road. We have been engaged since we met about two months after. She's a great person and has quite the heart of gold. Any help is much appreciated.

autism,throwaway181818999,2019/01/01,"Is My Friend Possibly Autistic? So, I'm sure you guys get this question often, but I'm curious and slightly concerned about my friend.

I'll list in bullets so it's faster to read:

* He says things that are really offensive, and acts like they're compliments/doesn't react at all. It's a little frustrating, because he can be really offensive, but I've learned to not take anything he says really seriously when it pertains to his ""compliments"".
* He doesn't have a filter. At all.
* He's not emotional. At all. Like sometimes he's expressive but he doesn't seem to show anything at all. Like, he's just neutral all the time.
* He's told me before that he's just not good with his emotions, and admitted to having issues with telling what emotions are what.
* He's constantly moving or jittery and has weird things that nobody else does, like when he's really excited or something he jumps around a lot, or he's always wiggling his fingers and stuff.

I wasn't sure because he's fine with eye contact and stuff, and he's fine talking to people and strangers. It's just that he's awkward as hell and just doesn't seem to get emotional/social stuff. That's why I was worried; what if he's a sociopath or something?

Anyway, so, do you think that he could possibly be autistic?",3.236484623541891,5.5498554268292715,4.122767762460235,84.55452279957582,76.03252032520325,7.36769176387416,28.58183103570166,8.321376580360154,2.228638246730294,1009,44,188,19,23,324,121,246,0.126,0.73,0.14400000000000002,0.4371,0,0,2,0,0,0,39.0,0,2,0,0,13,20,4,1,5,0,16,2,2,1,7,45,26,23,0,2,15,0,1,4,2,0,0,2,0,1,19,13,0,0,6,2,0,3,7,7,0,0,3,4,10,13,18,20,6,15,1,0,1,0,36,7,1,10,9,105,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09293266003087068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18381802440417835,0.0994252470013085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361669060897731,0.0,0.095037542756752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12069413696553352,0.0,0.08917310520043474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09773818198635334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09330028661921642,0.3768990500824199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725784378010025,0.0,0.11670385753962835,0.0,0.0,0.09367788665224464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058784287881353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11657237258543768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21825880958621816,0.11193987057771304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495242520995596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11870577044617107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07742981055223072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518209719166368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12511517440542774,0.0,0.11171737912962673,0.0,0.2861986056224415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776362168992201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2033515824703793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17196445691834414,0.11046145212747767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3835652146694719,0.0,0.0,0.2105276436473289,0.0,0.08397484092154296,0.08976990455420741,0.09761949628002492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14839996603208094,0.0715646191938974,0.0,0.0,0.06512567824440701,0.0,0.0,0.10672186284972024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10078028556119603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11342372732531875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,ConvictedWaffles,2019/01/01,Any tips for getting a 3 year old to sleep in his bed? My girlfriend’s 3 year old is highly non verbal autistic (not sure if that’s the proper description) but he never sleeps in his bed. He has a stair gate on his door and he lays by it all night until he falls asleep. It’s not a problem but I just can’t imagine he’s comfy. Is this just a phase he’ll grow out off or should we be doing something to encourage him to sleep in his bed?,1.2512500000000024,2.558061625000004,2.9795833333333337,95.07375,78.58333333333334,5.633333333333334,20.333333333333336,5.985473137389443,-0.14370416666666674,340,8,81,2,8,113,67,96,0.0,0.895,0.105,0.8536,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.0,1,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,5,0,7,4,4,0,3,17,9,6,0,3,8,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,5,0,4,3,0,0,1,0,0,2,4,1,0,0,0,0,8,2,12,6,1,17,0,0,0,0,14,8,0,2,7,47,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14910764273548513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455685414172966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2316653926218941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16911059885686866,0.0,0.0,0.20576524395242735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.460163231208301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2098068854208608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6582697153604501,0.0,0.0,0.16880082307534006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066545620218227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2823987979466138
autism,ysabelsrevenge,2019/01/01,"Sounds and coping mechanisms My son is five and is very sensitive to all encompassing sound, but fine (able to cope) with sharp noises. He also is sensitive with having things around his head/ears, so earphones, muffs, hoodies, hats have been a no go. 

I guess what I’m asking is, if anyone has any ideas or suggestions on different coping mechanisms (cause unfortunately his little brother is a screamer, he’s 1 and there’s not a lot I can do about it). Or even if you’ve had some luck with desensitization? More for having things around his head than the noise, I know that’s not really an option, but I’m running out of ideas. Any help would be good, we had to leave his favorite aunts wedding last night because the music was too loud and he was super upset (he wanted to stay and dance, but poor bunny was so overwhelmed).

autism,leothefox314,2019/01/02,"Personal Achievement! I remember posting something a while back about how there was a change in routine one day, and it snowballed into me yelling at someone.

Rewind a few months: I'd made a mantra for myself to recite if things go wrong, but it hasn't had any real use until...

Today: I was doing dishes, and I spilled coffee from a coffeepot on the floor. I thought, *Oh, my God, I'll have to clean this up, mop the floor, and who knows what else...*, and then I remembered the mantra: ""Everything is going to be okay."" I was able to take a step back, and then muster the courage to do one thing at a time; it was as if all the anger and anxiety had just disappeared.

It was as if someone had flipped a switch in me, and all of a sudden, I could (and can) remember to calm myself down.

autism,thickumsthrow,2019/01/02,"Upset Hi, I'm sort of getting familiar with Autism. I'm not diagnosed yet but I definitely think I'm on the spectrum, I even scheduled an appointment and hopefully will get a diagnosis from a professional soon. I've always had problems expressing my emotions and thoughts and I decided to confide this older brother and briefly tell him my concerns. He laughed at me and dismissed me right away, I assumed before he would react that way but for him to actually do it hurts a lot. Autism runs very strongly on my mothers side of the family, I don't understand why he could easily dismiss me even though he's totally aware of this fact. Did anyone else deal with reactions similar to this situation and how do you handle it? I'm extremely upset already and I don't know how to get over it, I've never talked about this before and now I'm too scared to even discuss this with anyone.

I've had experience with disabled children before but never in a professional setting. I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for me and what I should expect? I know I should be building rapport since it's a new client but the session is more than an hour long and I don't really know what's expected of me to do in that long period of time other than play with the child.

autism,neuroqueeer,2019/01/02,"[serious] Autistic Inertia - what to do when you go into hermit mode for weeks/months at a time? There are important things that I really need to do and very unpleasant things will happen if I don't do them.

Nonetheless, sometimes I spend weeks at a time hiding at home like a hermit and avoiding nearly everything. I will spend weeks at a time alone in my room sleeping and stimming and trying my best to block out any thoughts of the external world.

The important things don't get done, I feel increasingly anxious, and then there are bad consequences and I feel even more urge to isolate myself out of some sort of defiance or shame. My diet, self-care, health, connections to support people, finances... basically everything suffers when this happens.

It's like my brain goes on strike against the external world. I know rationally that I need to ""just do"" these important things. It's not that they are even particularly difficult. Once I get started, I can stick with a task for 20 hours at a time and do high quality work. But it is not predictable, and these hermit phases make life so, so much harder. 

Living with other people helps to avoid this but currently I live alone and will need to get by alone for the next 6 months.

Does anyone have advice on how to help with this? What works for you to break the inertia? How do you adapt to living life in the modern world if you have these sorts of phases?",5.8197526205450725,7.017996864150945,5.736572327044027,80.1560953878407,67.15094339622641,9.360587002096436,28.684486373165626,9.586721724236666,2.5102536687631023,1119,37,208,23,18,350,144,265,0.11,0.823,0.066,-0.8193,1,5,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,4,2,3,11,11,0,3,12,0,19,6,2,3,0,39,35,21,0,5,8,0,2,2,0,3,3,0,2,0,19,15,1,3,4,0,3,2,4,7,0,0,2,2,22,4,37,30,5,36,0,1,0,0,8,18,0,6,17,141,41,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073932076173887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3414704021841389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747359075017609,0.0,0.0,0.12415594890849388,0.0,0.07684477809104452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09176207998121608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11533348401519565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12268497407871308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0961744093090629,0.11246606544330796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14517609677511925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19754243427674104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11113769076103493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17225496220908715,0.0,0.062458818704057825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19436877526478985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11681877791058212,0.0,0.0,0.14732758057090845,0.11611559968836276,0.11023886553811993,0.0,0.10822956343709096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06039827809548135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15525152873816087,0.107383377007077,0.0,0.2911316813489951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07335923969961641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17544258898351306,0.0,0.08078929537432394,0.24446882664508424,0.0,0.0,0.11688011396855764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704013072958824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523819277467876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07040488497284236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1146498813355403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997957282369217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869411210518327,0.0,0.07778793019347699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12471344936179485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920512492571869,0.0,0.0,0.08724848617124456,0.25633477147682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07461502462009663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067917815418887,0.0,0.0,0.17631062947915932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16001731514079662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,JustaRandomguy9999,2019/01/02,"On this new years eve autistic me fucked around with a bell tower that was made in the year 1289 in Holland, and it was fucking amazing!! (Please excuse my English i am Dutch, and yeah with ‘autistic me’ i mean i really have autism, also the part where i fuck it up begins at the end of the story)

So, kind of a small thing that happened but i got my ass beaten by someone that worked there.

In the Netherlands there’s this tradition in the province Groningen to make the bell tower ring from 17:00 untill 08:00 from 2018 to 2019, non-stop without breaks, you can visit it and it’s a very small room, there’s 2 ropes you can pull on, it HAS to be seperately pulled or else you’ll fuck up the ENTIRE tower and it’ll crush everyone that’s beneath it.

So there’s this very typical guy pulling one rope, that one cliche old guy with his white mustash and white beard and blue overall, he’s obviously been doing this for years, one hand in his pocket, one hand pulling the rope.

And you could pull the ropes yourself if you wanted to, so my brother-in-law that was with me pushed me and said “go ahead! It’s alright!” So i stood there, holding that rope, i was holding it for just 1 second, i had to act fast or i fucked up the entire tower, so i gave it the BIGGEST yank i could ever give, but here’s the complicated part, i got scared and i let go, and i grabbed it again but from higher up, so what do you think that happened with me??

##i flew up 10 feet in the air while holding the rope!!

Someone that worked there(the room was seriously very small, everyone looked at me right away)yanked me right from the rope as i came down again, and he took atleast 10-20 seconds to syncronize the bell tower again, he gave the rope to someone else that would pull it, and he gave me the angriest look you could imagine...

##”GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS BELL TOWER!!! GET OUT!! NOW!! NO, NOW!!”

He had a few drinks down his throat, but i do have to admit, all those people who were mid-drunk, were doing a goddamng good job at maintaining peace at the place, so i went out, and my brother-in-law is a VERY serious and diciplined person, but he came out with THE biggest laugh i have ever seen!!

He said, and i qoute

##”Sebastiaan, je bent mijn verdomde held”

=

##”Sebastian, you’re my goddamn fucking hero”

And shook my hand, it wasn’t worth it, not in the slightest, luckily i live 70KM away from that riligious place, but it was the best time i’ve ever had in year!!

(Despite the tower that COULD have been broken down cuz of me, and JUST to clarify, my brother-in-law was there to protect me cuz of my autism, as you can see i’m really impulsive, but he didn’t drink anything and drove me sober save back to home :)",5.184049214417744,5.120778672828095,5.224509588724583,87.71730042744919,68.18669131238447,8.09336876155268,28.551351663585955,7.413659706084162,1.3738506931608132,2086,63,452,18,32,652,242,541,0.104,0.78,0.116,0.7883,8,0,2,0,0,0,97.0,0,8,0,6,29,20,8,2,31,2,39,15,6,4,5,69,80,42,0,7,14,0,4,0,0,3,0,3,3,3,36,31,2,5,4,2,1,18,5,12,0,6,33,14,51,8,64,38,5,85,0,0,7,8,32,43,8,3,23,290,87,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061421709666902004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06320477231746947,0.06837360068138154,0.0,0.0,0.14432348176170107,0.059059053064177226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08060313117190802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17569114584596393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2452932819533498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15048122838104314,0.0,0.0,0.12832307151677064,0.0,0.06802729575236093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2084262021522772,0.0,0.1467827992293327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4970411973636221,0.08025590274154785,0.07367928890698297,0.08730121004897927,0.06442120696518865,0.12285750755078155,0.0,0.0,0.15209997937670391,0.13583853832358705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0770426543087929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07621807784913648,0.0,0.0,0.07998160271013957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853931218960643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06782108220187938,0.0,0.1289953481798033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267566969942288,0.05126858406012051,0.0,0.0,0.08366422214018841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07417968830758516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08059494956844536,0.0,0.20818286297477695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16634677033152198,0.0,0.05324759160481213,0.06706401396137977,0.160491791045269,0.0843098950623266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840774736088652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13118376428837986,0.14612013934997115,0.0,0.07689617889493397,0.0,0.06120441718333058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19523235760267768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06421323341657087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05102647629567645,0.04921416685657594,0.0,0.0,0.044786181102759726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533426318386715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534918893236558,0.0453021534455166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07119990739378909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403821811847461,0.0,0.11183132766864844,0.0,0.0,0.05456076026595535,0.0,0.0,0.1978421163197566

autism,anonymous8097,2019/01/02,"Can a dent in the skull be related to autism? My little girl has a dent in her skull since she was born. At the time we lived in Mexico (now we are living legally in the US), and the doctor told us that it's normal and that some people have odd head shapes and it's not an issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

We believed it also because I have a first cousin once removed that has a similar indentation and does not have any developmental issue (she has epilepsy, which I also have and I don't have any irregularities in my head shape, so I don't think that's related).

&amp;#x200B;

But due to the recent ASD diagnosis, I am wondering if, in my daughter's case, it could be related. I just called the doctor's office and they are going to tell us if she needs to be checked and if so give us an appointment.

Have any of you been told that the ASD of your child is related to something like a dent in the skull?

autism,Velsetta,2019/01/02,"I need help, to help my son. I am the mom of a 6  year old little boy who has autism. He was born 7 weeks early and very sick for the first several years of his life, and for a while we thought his delays were due to that.. but as he got older he did obtain an autism spectrum diagnosis at 4. He's been in OT and speech since he was 18 months old.  He's had \~ 24 months of PT, we currently also do aquatic therapy and in home play based ABA. A few months ago we've implemented and AAC device to assist with communication we are also familiar with PECS and he has some basic language. He makes progress pretty consistently and shows he's a bright young boy who has great problem solving skills and cognitive aptitude though his IQ has not been tested.

  
The trouble is since he entered kindergarten he's been really really struggling.  Since the start of school this fall he's developed obsessive compulsive behaviors, anxiety, night terrors , rigidity, separation anxiety , an increased need to visually stim. Of most concern though, is that he has started hurting himself. In moments of frustration or confusion he will intentionally hit his head on something near by. If there is nothing he will drop to floor and bang his head on the floor or smack himself. He's already in an adapted class room, where they have an amazing sensory room . He's given frequent sensory breaks and his aide is quite wonderful in trying to teach him how to use his talker.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've had several meetings w/ his school and for now we've adjusted his days to just half days  ( full day kindergarten) thinking that maybe the days are just too long. But usually I'm getting a call by 10 am to inform me about a self injurious behavior. Sometimes they're able to move him forward, but other times he's had to leave early because he is just so distraught. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have really bad anxiety and over think everything.

Whenever there is a lot of loud noise like someone vacuuming or something, i get really frustrated.

I change my opinion on things all the time. One minute I'll love a character in a tv show or a video game and then I'll like a completely different one that i used to hate.

autism,genesis49m,2019/01/02,"Should I tell my brother he was diagnosed with autism? My brother is 17, and I'm 21.  Years ago, my mom confided in me that my brother was kind of odd growing up, and that the school wanted to send him to special education classes and that he was suspected of being autistic but nothing more.  So I always knew that he was a little different from others in his mannerisms, but I chalked it up to a quirky personality.  When we were younger, he had major temper and anger issues. He would bang his head against the wall for hours and refuse to stop.  As he grew older, he was always the odd one out socially and didn't pick up on normal cues.  He would also have these emotional outbursts, like something would upset him during family dinner and he'd start bawling on the floor and pounding his fists.  Whenever I'm outside with him, I'll need to gently nudge him to correct him on things like his volume (he'll almost start shouting), how he's walking a little strangely, or other things.  

But overall, he's changed a lot since he was younger. I'd say going into high school has helped him.  Other than his social quirks and sometimes extreme mindedness, he's doing OK overall.   His grades are pretty good (though he's needed to ask for forgiveness for forgotten submissions due to his ""absent-mindedness""), but he's ranked in the top 5% of a very competitive high school.  He has a lot of friends, and he's founded and president of some clubs at his school that he's passionate about (e.g. historical preservation, Esperanto club).  He has some weird interests, like he'll know the population, geographic information, past presidents, etc of every single country in the world, or he'll remember strange biographical information about obscure historical figures.  He also tested really well, earning the AP Scholar with Distinction Award, won some essay contests, won in a lot of chess tournaments, and won some model UN tournaments.  

My mom has raised the two of us on her own, and she didn't finish high school.  So in some ways, I feel like I raised my brother going up. I understood his quirks and guided him socially, and I was also there for him for a lot of his academic troubles or keeping track of deadlines for him because he would get overwhelmed by them.  I would also be really patient with him and help understand some things he couldn't grasp.  We are very close and have a strong relationship.  I also think I was a good role model for him, compared to my mom.  I'm graduating from college soon and will be starting a job in engineering.  He wants to go to college and eventually become a professor in International Relations.  

Unfortunately, his college application submissions went really poorly. 
 His absent-mindedness led him to mess up deadlines, and he didn't get to submit his application to Caltech, his school of choice.  A few hours ago, my mom told me he was actually diagnosed with autism and she thinks him not being treated has caused these kinds of academic issues.  He has done well in school, but there were times when he made grave mistakes (e.g. forgot about a big national competition and didn't go).  Apparently, when he was seven years old, the school had hired someone (a doctor?) to shadow him in his classes.  The women shadowing him would sit with him and observe him.  After four months of this, she diagnosed him with ""15% autism,"" as my mom said.  My mom really isn't very educated and is distrustful of medical practices.  My brother's GP confirmed and said that if his anger issues continued, he would need to be sent to a ""special school"" but that he should be able to grow out of it.  My mom got scared and changed doctors, and now he only gets a quick yearly physical to get his flu shot and that's it.  But my mom didn't keep any paperwork or let anything show on his records or whatnot.

Honestly, I don't know much more about autism than my past hour of Googling.  My mom made me promise I wouldn't tell him because she didn't want him to think he's ""different"" or color his thoughts about himself, but I think he may have a right to know something like this about himself, right? But also, I'm not sure.  I think he's improved so much over the past four years, and I don't even understand the full details to tell him.  I think it would upset him a lot, but also it may bring him some solace.  Like, he's always struggled with tasks like tying his shoes.  I think we've spent five hours cumulatively trying to have him learn, but he never got it.  He berated himself for it heavily, and I think everytime shoes are brought up, he feels really bad, so maybe knowing would help?  I'm not really sure.

Thank you for your advice.",7.0262805740853045,7.310237475372277,7.103064483525369,74.62553668890237,64.28064146620848,10.37512297015026,33.84158749410417,10.148584353443301,3.3682275183612984,3688,146,666,77,51,1185,365,873,0.093,0.779,0.128,0.9892,4,0,2,0,0,0,122.0,3,2,1,8,30,46,4,5,32,1,64,12,3,6,5,146,129,66,1,22,21,14,2,7,1,18,7,4,0,2,25,44,1,5,28,4,2,14,15,15,2,6,40,7,95,31,97,62,22,91,0,2,1,1,138,41,0,23,41,415,120,29,0.04200634875413761,0.0,0.04099213689538227,0.0,0.0,0.04104811783933255,0.07447218730498192,0.0,0.042063290472762895,0.0,0.0,0.2351472334554564,0.1048579416656425,0.0,0.0,0.02856575761189032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034567645851781674,0.0,0.039270265644855834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03507354660334527,0.05121336062337852,0.0463927119277349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04315209135180534,0.08887429427760392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279066792762647,0.0,0.08777538770498211,0.0,0.08599055582252506,0.0,0.04298707906826225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04725148844843409,0.0,0.0,0.046848182737684194,0.027744797180797445,0.0,0.035392160544326916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0395998471360994,0.0,0.042479344159300464,0.030009343943221262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04605779323890289,0.0324540008461933,0.0,0.08778633390371599,0.0,0.09549270413465327,0.07046586471450578,0.06719262890334292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04311063265365416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08446791034220702,0.13314604130199015,0.0,0.0,0.16547116795293093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13153114352186746,0.04168481945253782,0.0746743456956334,0.0,0.08748629623266077,0.09234236285739428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04295433761830741,0.0,0.14365526125046962,0.08420279383084701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785614777476052,0.0,0.07949484572437401,0.0,0.0,0.04220102336055171,0.0,0.0,0.042316977077768464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44277595173392653,0.03352906681160893,0.0,0.061758999293451376,0.09344152602204196,0.032397885768448834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041157302986727186,0.04030622454708591,0.0,0.04407859678903065,0.0,0.02846458904865415,0.03194772110609162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12029943900977988,0.0,0.03667832347170985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04273555823793351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16146205587560553,0.0,0.0,0.04509909812477274,0.04758500449013666,0.07174638463448665,0.07991531404451736,0.033405134540674224,0.042055683169681085,0.3826140079600433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03474808577105324,0.0,0.0,0.12846054771182064,0.035591842983626755,0.06467707903090884,0.04154535301739852,0.0,0.0891969295610073,0.0,0.0,0.03511918847824567,0.0,0.043914156273957804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791809731521142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101462009476536,0.03867380220186725,0.0,0.0,0.08372145474048734,0.21532777711703271,0.04127102437305834,0.033348348756097115,0.02449423976464596,0.0,0.0,0.0401388663771069,0.0,0.028519553434909306,0.0,0.0410340989715928,0.08746018097302527,0.050528465445922606,0.0,0.0,0.10397891094867404,0.07432929852647491,0.03334268440644194,0.0,0.0,0.07553750457930035,0.03894030613868514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2685609444052365,0.0,0.0,0.10820284546168824
autism,EarthAngel007,2019/01/02,"My son (now 17) remembers being nonverbal. He has a couple suggestions. When my son was a baby, we realized there was something not neurotypical about him. He started walking at 9 months. It wasn’t gradual. One day, he just started walking. 

He enjoyed lining up his toys in a row. He flipped over his trucks, choosing to play with the tires. He’d watch them spin. He’d spend hours playing like this.

He was born prematurely and suffered from constant ear infections, which affected his hearing. I knew sign language and would sign to him. Also, I’d tell him about a million times a day that I loved him.

When he was 2, he started saying “I love you”. Nobody but my husband and me could understand him. He’d say it all the time. 

He started talking in full sentences when he was 4. I don’t know why or how. He just started talking, though nobody else could understand him. He was in speech therapy throughout elementary and junior high. He definitely benefitted from it.

A few years ago, my son told me he remembers being nonverbal. The thoughts were there, but his body wouldn’t let him say them. So he said, “I love you.” He wanted to show us a toy? “I love you.” He wanted something to eat? “I love you.”

I asked him, “Did you know you were loved?” He said yes. ❤️

He once read a book (I can’t remember what it’s called) about a person who’s nonverbal. They’re the smartest person in the room, but everyone treats them like they’re stupid. 

My son’s theory goes like this: If you couldn’t communicate with people, you’d be frustrated. Perhaps some meltdowns could be avoided if they had more communication options?

My son recommends sign language. There are also apps available for his nonverbal peeps. 

Of course, every person with autism is different. But these are his suggestions.

autism,quietkindlove,2019/01/02,My parents never told me I had autism until recently... I never realized I was autistic. Im 15 but I cant help but feel ashamed of myself for not being normal. I keep crying because it feels like being a normal person is something that will never happen. I feel like Ill always be recognized as autistic then be treated less. Im sorry if that all sounds rude somehow.

autism,Fkfkdoe73,2019/01/02,"Mildly autistic student in my class - any advice on logistics? I have a aspie student in my class. He's 5 years old - K3. Socially he's around 3 years old but academically he's a teenager. He's also learnt *most* of the material I'm teaching already somehow. I need to keep him challenged but how? Any ideas? I teach phonics but I can probably help other teachers with other ideas. Other teachers tend to be focused on his weaknesses but really I like to be focused on his strengths. He's very bright in terms of language and logic. For logic in particular I think he's ready for engaging discussions at college or university level. 

I find this very difficult because I remember school being very boring and difficult for this reason. We don't fit in. But... I'm a teacher now and I at least aim to try while alternatives are worked out. I'm interested in practical solutions.",2.423298701298698,5.307093684848488,4.494891774891774,76.83090909090909,84.87878787878788,7.506493506493506,29.06926406926407,8.418075326091056,2.9821082251082256,698,35,117,18,21,238,102,165,0.103,0.7040000000000001,0.193,0.9523,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,1,0,0,3,5,10,0,0,4,0,7,1,0,2,0,26,14,12,0,1,6,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,7,0,1,8,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,15,6,23,11,3,22,0,0,1,0,13,15,0,3,8,70,20,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691986374035252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19107359309056848,0.13846673327421502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354937336347216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541388082469517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554967304771186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582545240115497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11605773976584155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39092699326473423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539022762280495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08459157460925207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283873635141937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3633802916155659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866832879842378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11092331506101737,0.17802541919040446,0.0,0.0,0.19614341276463915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17523545050695155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17650301464917714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109465196002892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11755641511825635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42859675369476585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260541159141681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22300381818918927

 I open and close my palm. It helps me calm down when Im angry and impulsive. I rock when Im feeling nervous or overwhelmed. I play with my hair when im bored. I flap and twirl my fingers when Im happy. I make clicking sounds when Im happy as well. I spin when Im happy or overwhelmed. 

Stimming helps me. People mock me. Sometimes they mimic my stims. Its really annoying and embarassing. I sometimes dont know they are mocking me until someone tells me.

autism,cs24601,2019/01/03,"Saw a new doctor today [Original Story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/a5titz/youre_too_connected/?st=JQHD1R2W&amp;sh=23fc4966)

First guy said my IQ was too high to be on the spectrum. 

Went to a different psychiatrist today. He looked at my report from the first guy and my written evaluation results and said “Looks like Asperger’s to me”. 

He’s going to do a couple more things before he confirms it, like another evaluation and an interview with my wife and maybe my mom, but said for now he thinks it’s likely I’m on the spectrum. 

He also said even if it turned out I wasn’t, he was going to help write a treatment plan for my specific difficulties regardless of whatever label he has to stick on it, so I feel a lot better going to him. 

Thanks everyone for the encouragement! This sub has been great through this process.

autism,fl0w3rp0w3r666,2019/01/03,"Hello aspies! So I’m v new to reddit, and only really joined to be involved in /r/autism 😅 I’m a student in England and am currently doing work with other autistic academics so that the neurotypicals can more accurately understand the lives of autistic people. For example, one of our main goals at the moment is to explain that autism isn’t to be cured! Aversion techniques and therapies are unethical, and hopefully as I learn from you guys and other people around me, myself and my peers will be able to change the way that the world sees autism.

autism,hematomatoed,2019/01/03,"My three year old son won't let me play the piano. He rushes in from the other room and screams and cries and claws at my wrists. If I don't stop he'll break down in tears while clawing at me.

It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm playing loudly, or softly, or in the upper or lower register, or whether I'm playing Beethoven or the ABCs.

He likes to play the piano himself, so I know the keys don't sound like nails on a chalkboard to him.

The tantrums stop pretty immediately after I stop playing. He's cheerful again within minutes.

He's non-verbal, so he can't tell me why he's so upset, and he can't respond to questions like ""Do *you* want to take a turn?""

Is this a sensory perception issue or is it just a toddler being an asshole?

What should I *do*? Is it cruel to play the piano when it upsets him so much, or is this a place where I need to be teaching him he can't always get his way and I do get to play an instrument sometimes?",1.771835648832397,3.3295830502512587,3.5029323086018316,90.79775051729237,77.79396984924621,5.687378066804611,23.766183860478865,6.2272716619740125,0.5034798108187992,733,24,160,5,17,245,110,199,0.172,0.722,0.106,-0.9136,1,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,0,0,8,16,2,2,15,0,18,1,1,0,0,27,29,21,0,4,11,1,1,3,0,3,0,3,1,0,8,5,0,3,4,7,0,1,7,5,0,1,0,4,17,11,18,23,1,24,0,0,0,0,19,12,0,10,12,102,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1632919895254072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21556648343942256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.205060363887198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048293316563836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10785140287615656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20067433530609768,0.0,0.2876269379108076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426303395144133,0.14551356288380032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20592665612644048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20503479462834265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996522404684276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21983988989117487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17865454654853188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19409183249214648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4922101139344178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14755220435531802,0.0,0.17152723013349874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21345876719127768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575068939573616,0.15577055546846494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17708105340748614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12637567761025287
autism,sexlexia_survivor,2019/01/03,"Montessori, pretend play, and autism? I'm looking to change child care when my daughter is three. It is purely due to a move, there is nothing wrong with her current daycare. 

I am looking at a Montessori school since I have read that is good with children with autism. I toured the school and was told they do not like fantasy play/pretend play at this age. There are no dolls, no play houses, no fake kitchens...its all based in reality. They make their lunch in a real kitchen, they clean real messes, etc. 

That's all sounds awesome, and I loved the school in general, however my daughter has been really into pretend play which has been encouraged by all of her therapists (speech, OT and floor time) They all agree that pretend play/fantasy play is good for her. 

Do any of you know about Montessori, pretend play, and have an opinion on if one out weighs the other in importance? I'm thinking there is nothing stopping pretend play at home right?",5.929237288135593,7.141121090395488,5.162500000000001,84.32137711864408,66.90960451977399,7.933898305084746,32.829096045197744,8.07648339933343,2.351990960451977,751,32,139,9,12,225,106,177,0.093,0.669,0.239,0.9845,2,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,5,0,5,16,0,0,7,0,17,4,0,1,5,25,27,7,0,1,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,2,3,2,7,10,3,1,2,14,0,1,4,3,0,2,4,4,15,13,20,23,5,19,0,0,2,1,16,12,0,2,7,87,22,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061508560961848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1591506100982341,0.0,0.16512921783291046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17408866838825635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618523886756366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565773447210488,0.0,0.0,0.18011420510143494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08578645982748963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07626078133547798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26216320401431964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14088303080581185,0.0,0.1041955113276176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16590569371137115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.299557274118808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10577491194152774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15613857030245845,0.3553435911526411,0.09999930506021547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13330541157408038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4739334538361808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291244959232458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13050352008928753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18123986841806036,0.0,0.10002022435748087,0.0,0.0,0.09102102439460984,0.0,0.0,0.14915673116566472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17066683071414826,0.0,0.0

autism,warningtrackpower12,2019/01/03,"Looking for jobs for my adult sister with autism that might fit her or any advice when looking for a job for her. Hi. My sister was recently diagnosed with Autism at age 21. As of now she doesn't have a job of any kind, and just kind of does nothing productive laying around at home. Even though her condition is obvious if you hang with her long enough, I think she can be productive at something. She did well in a normal school setting (like without extra help, heck sometimes she helped me) and can do jobs around the house like vacuum, take the trash out, shovel snow, etc. I think she can be useful to society.

Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.

Musts for a perfect job for her:

- WORK ALONE: only time she likes to do a job is while alone. She sings to herself and has a great time. Doesn't really work well with others in groups.

- Repetitive and not rough/hard work: She doesn't like change from the routine. Preferably not heavy lifting jobs otherwise she won't WANT to do it. 

- Very low stress: i think this one is obvious from the articles i've read, but it leads to my next topic...

- Lenient timelines: You can't tell her ""finish this in 1 hour, start now"" or she freaks out, but if you say ""sometime today have the deck shoveled"" she responds better. I'm sure this depends on the boss/company.",4.2098235294117625,5.928368521568627,4.329166666666668,86.73375000000001,71.62745098039215,7.609803921568627,25.69117647058824,8.238735603445708,1.5205647058823528,1043,33,205,16,20,323,150,255,0.051,0.8140000000000001,0.136,0.9644,7,2,1,0,0,0,45.0,0,3,0,6,10,17,0,1,12,0,25,1,0,3,5,39,36,15,0,7,11,2,0,4,0,4,1,1,2,1,7,12,0,0,4,2,0,2,8,3,2,1,2,3,28,14,33,27,3,31,0,1,2,0,32,13,1,7,19,131,35,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17180618622341645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18209322795797245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793422255470169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15651426749243735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774785595206732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09299545482753986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892251984405645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692925298659456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09083289990699052,0.09804112869636618,0.05806268401675045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19383869243261928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07874867963979597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784632522379608,0.0,0.08817931544226336,0.0,0.08657208841828633,0.10143451682340912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6106488142901974,0.0,0.0,0.1830861887672594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17179045934735632,0.0,0.0,0.07779618764880049,0.14764186929672368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932569442832554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09349160469178852,0.0,0.08613158938332217,0.08435050234951383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05956902221446182,0.06685831666205573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08793221182753669,0.0,0.056316386515695385,0.0,0.08679896192680568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06990830600537319,0.0,0.08896801683733398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06767619850357327,0.17388735544861728,0.0,0.06222203395008152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069880103083577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828526479092803,0.0,0.06609619342688823,0.0,0.07683583603794182,0.08093426462412458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16898450276961333,0.08636957882968446,0.0,0.1025202162709978,0.0,0.08332690572475507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759246520725898,0.0,0.07253365512672515,0.05185066525453432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1580804585170046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847405823283915,0.0,0.1919951358236512,0.0,0.0,0.062447621170708935,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,heebichibi,2019/01/03,"Advocacy or excuse-making? My son is in 2nd grade and is verbal. He struggles with sensory overload, understanding verbal instructions, social play, and transitioning to new activities, as well as having ADHD. 

We finally got him an IEP and it's been going better, but at his recent meeting, I was asked if I talk about things he ""can't do"" in front of my son. I do advocate for him and I am open about his autism, as I feel it's important to make people aware of it and help them understand to accept my son as he is. However, the question was whether I'm making my son internalize limitations on himself?  I never talk about his autism at or around him, we haven't had that conversation yet, but I was hurt by the implication. His team is intent on treating him like a ""normal"" kid and frequently stresses this to me. Sometimes they make me question myself. It feels like erasure. 

I don't know, I have a lot of feelings mixed up in this. My questions are: 

1. Is it okay for me to be open about my son's autism when a situation arises? Is this fair to him?  I'm not a social media drama queen, I've never posted about it on Facebook or made a big deal about it, but when a situation comes up and someone asks, I just state that he has autism and sometimes needs a break.

2. Is it right for the special ed team and his teacher to insist on treating him like a ""normal"" kid? I don't want him to feel like he has to mask to be accepted, but I understand wanting to feel ""normal"" as well. My son doesn't express any feelings about social acceptance, I do not know how he feels about any of this. 

3. When should I talk to my son about the fact that he has autism? I've been waiting for it to come up but I don't know when it will. I don't think he notices the differences in himself, or if he does, he doesn't know how to verbalize his feelings. 

I appreciate this community a lot. Thank you for your time!

autism,Extempo,2019/01/03,"Advice needed for parent of 3rd grade boy My boy is a medium functioning echolia verbal special ed 3rd grader who is struggling with school right now 

Starting around Halloween he has decided to make life difficult for his teachers and aids. Non cooperative verbals and sometimes physically combative. It is like he just decided when the weather got cold he was done with school. 

We had hoped that Christmas break would help but he just put us through the ringer trying to get him ready and dropped off at school. 

It’s a long shot but any other parents or folks with some good ideas? We are worried if this keeps up the patience of the school for his behavior will evaporate.

autism,pnlrogue1,2019/01/03,"[Scotland, UK] Recent Diagnosis - What Now For Me? Hi there,

I'm 33 years old and only found out in the last few months that I might be autistic. After receiving my diagnosis last month, I'm not sure what to do now and am hoping some more experienced folk can answer a few questions for me.

&amp;#x200B;

My son received a report of recommendations for his school and for us on things that would help him when he was diagnosed but I have nothing like that - is that normal for an adult? Should/can I get one?

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I'm still very uncomfortable about it (I haven't adjusted mentally to having it yet and find thinking about it pretty tough). I'm finding it hard to accept that all my life I've struggled with things that others haven't and that I'll always have these problems (I've always had this lingering hope that I'd just stop making social errors and having to think through everything I say or get over my hatred of calling people/getting called). If anyone has any advice on accepting it and moving on, that would also be gratefully received.

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks!",5.433676470588236,7.0706730539215705,5.67870588235294,78.57217647058825,68.46078431372548,8.185098039215687,28.30588235294117,8.648137234880735,2.197743529411764,869,30,152,14,15,276,135,204,0.123,0.7390000000000001,0.139,0.6805,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,1,0,0,0,10,11,0,1,4,0,18,2,0,1,2,36,31,12,0,7,5,1,1,1,0,3,2,1,0,1,21,9,0,1,10,0,0,4,3,3,0,1,3,3,14,8,22,23,5,24,0,0,0,0,16,6,0,7,15,104,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10058507711803368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08231559815374104,0.17129724339874755,0.33458405590514473,0.3752251100526351,0.06999806772075293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07197324767450543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21021249749761303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447497454306244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09250967275603028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18815805784553905,0.0,0.0,0.11286087958903665,0.0,0.0,0.16133495816135401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09220787899001294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06899391675744453,0.0,0.0,0.20447167512303732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16780850150207102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727047237775774,0.05028793485679835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870867298046401,0.1043580521288098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037323991261038,0.10919579950777032,0.0,0.0,0.1643205071736476,0.10940164225471978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10085262644913386,0.09876712789302744,0.0,0.10801101952185033,0.0,0.06975016237769037,0.07828529443857954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10472001269022516,0.0,0.09849311748575193,0.0,0.0,0.11530867875666095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10163406185874654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08185656762786771,0.0,0.104173837174695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10492737774070884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220254184810663,0.08605671751464011,0.0,0.1076080714024098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701327015723488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09476700958977882,0.0,0.0,0.13676841431913694,0.13191080497129368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12381589853710735,0.0,0.0,0.0849306239192931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14624150455502974,0.0,0.3752251100526351,0.06628557000928964
autism,AbsurdSisyphus,2019/01/03,"Hey I need advice, any would be appreciated I am in the process of getting an ""autism spectrum diagnosis"". In particular, I struggle with rigid/restricted thinking and ""black and white"" thinking. I view the world in extremes: either yes or no. All or nothing.

My mind is swayed easily by enticing ideas, so I try to compartmentalize myself so that I don't get too distracted-- but that is far easier said than done. I have a particular playlist of music that I have created. It's an amalgamation of 346 songs that I have discovered over the past 5 years. I tend to listen to only two or three songs a day, but I repeat those songs constantly because for me there is a certain sense of comfort in the familiar. I can listen to one song for several hours. 170 hours out of 1628 hours of listening time has just been on just one song: *183 Times* by Greg Haines. I fast forward to ""1 minute and 46 seconds"" in the track because everything before that time-mark is buildup. This process repeats itself depending on the track I'm listening to.

I'm sensitive to information that I consume. I try not to listen to certain songs in my playlist because an influx of emotions or ideas may even push me to change my life/career trajectory, so I hand-pick only a few tracks that are conducive to my current worldview.  If I listen to one song, for example, I feel overwhelmingly bombarded with emotions and ideas. I can't even put my playlist on shuffle because I will skip 99% of the songs because most of them simply do not fit into the worldview that I am creating for myself.

I try not to read any works of fiction because every time I am enthralled by a piece of literature I immediately entertain fantasies about becoming a novelist or a fiction writer again. I can't read philosophy without wanting to be a philosopher. I can't consume certain pieces of art or enjoy certain types of architecture because of the ideas associated with them. For some reason I cannot enjoy something purely for pleasure's sake-- only video games but that's about it. 

  
I specifically cannot listen to certain songs or read literature or consume certain pieces of art from certain artists because I am profoundly effected by the art itself or anything with ideas associated with said topic. I would love to read ""Light in August"" by William Faulkner or visit Japan or listen to Chopin's music without wanting to become a novelist again, rekindle my interest in Japanese Zen or want to be a Parisian intellectual and study at the doctoral level.  


Yes, I've learned French because I wanted to study in France to get a doctorate in Philosophy there and I've wanted to teach ESL in Japan because of my, once, large obsession with Zen Buddhism. Yes, I spent everyday in the past summer writing a book because I wanted to win a Nobel Prize in literature.   


No. I am not joking. I only think and act in extremes. These past few weeks I have been teaching myself computer programming and calculus because I wanted to be a Mathematician. Yes, I created a music playlist of 26 songs that literally all in the ""electronica"" genre and I played it in the background while I taught myself calculus. 

In other words, I'm being quite serious in saying that I have to purposely avoid certain pieces of information or else my mind goes into a frenzy and attaches itself to anything and everything that there is about the subject. I wish I could be curious again, but if I start learning about the economic history of Korea I can't clearly delineate a separation between a ""hobby"" or fleeting interest and a lifelong pursuit.   


Every time I choose something to do with my life, I 100% dedicate all my time and mental ability to it, even down to the music I listen to everyday, or the art I consume in general.   


When I wanted to be a writer of literary fiction, for example, I would listen to *""Like a Valley With No Echo"" by Hammock* (specifically from 3:00 in the track to the end, on repeat) for hours upon hours. Listening to it on the train, while writing, while thinking-- it was enjoyable but in hindsight this is exhausting. This is different from OCD in the sense that this wasn't compulsory in nature, but that the music fed my mind, and that it was for the most part enjoyable. I wasn't listening to the song because of the song, but rather that my mind in the way that it interpreted the song fed into this vision that I had of the future.   


Honestly, this is torture. Complete torture. I want to cry. I don't know why I can't read a damn book and just enjoy it. I don't know why I can't just take a computer programming class to just learn without wanting to be neck-deep in everything ""computing."" I don't know how to stop this ""rigid/black &amp; white thinking"" mindset. I hope this sounds like something on the autism spectrum because my doctor has currently ruled out OCD.  


Sorry if this was an unnecessary rant but... I don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep living my life like this. This is something I have been dealing with for years but I am just now coming to terms with the fact that this is a serious, serious problem. I don't know who I am or what I am interested in. Even when I was a little boy I studied Chemistry in 3rd grade and when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I said ""a Chemist"". I tried out for the basketball team in high school 3 years straight and I knew every statistic for every player in the NBA and I wanted to be a basketball player.   


I don't know how to stop this all-or-nothing thinking and its literally killing me. Seriously.

autism,smonkie392,2019/01/03,"Any other autists with psychosis? I've had a psychosis because of my autism.

autism,patachjjessica,2019/01/03,Weighted blanket Second post tonight. Sorry. So my son sleeps fairly well. Lately he’s been taking a couple hours to fall asleep though and just destroying his room. When he sleeps he also tosses and turns constantly. Overall gets about 12+ hours a night though. I’m looking into making a weighted blanket though to make his sleep more “sound” maybe. And tips for someone without a sewing machine but where it won’t slip around? And the best type of fabric to use? Also a s side note he often puts pillows on himself when sleeping so assuming he likes the added weight/padding 🤷🏼‍♀️ don’t want to buy a $100+ to find out if he likes it though rather make my own for less than $40,2.1309593326381666,4.480489233576645,2.7826329509906143,92.54191605839416,80.02189781021897,4.7901981230448385,22.19447340980188,5.773587663045528,0.2164998957247133,543,17,108,3,14,169,100,137,0.026,0.8420000000000001,0.132,0.9423,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,17,5,1,0,8,0,3,7,5,4,0,20,13,16,0,3,5,1,2,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,7,2,0,2,0,1,2,3,1,1,1,1,4,5,4,15,11,4,18,0,0,1,0,10,7,0,3,10,59,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18598113191537924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103515513625517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12203064399030547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12565938689004488,0.0,0.0,0.1286636726375591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10627951859061588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060752475450902337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22902842895611664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311710093472659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361889187619492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09764748081909068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2328571448167793,0.0,0.11682076340159585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912265377332084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11136588402679448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1168953922561956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4654633721352108,0.0,0.09852524742572152,0.0,0.0,0.1301680284710254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08742949152040025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4569853704669509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12648127866096684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043019696606978,0.0,0.0,0.06858605712616217,0.0,0.0,0.4247999575746116,0.10455136211997827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120915689692342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,allisgoodmayne,2019/01/03,"Those of you who have been officially diagnosed, how did you go about doing it? I (20F) am self-diagnosed, but it’s quite apparent to me and others close to me that I’m on the spectrum; especially because autism runs strongly in my family. We realized a few years ago that this was the case with me, but I’ve never had an official diagnosis. I never felt I wanted one until now. The only thing is that I have no idea where I’d go to get diagnosed - can anyone help me with this? Who can diagnose autism (and tourette’s too, I’m even more certain that I have that)? Also, do you feel any type of way about having a diagnosis? Possibly feeling better about the situation, like you feel more valid and less like a freak, or is it the opposite? Thanks in advance for any feedback.

autism,zandafarius,2019/01/03,"Looking for help with my brother's recent outbursts Hey everyone, I'm not autistic but my brother is - he's 23, 220lbs, nonverbal, and developed PANDAS a few years ago that has never fully gone away.

Since the PANDAS, he's experienced anxiety attacks where he can tend to get aggressive (grabbing me/my parents' forearms, slamming doors, jumping, running around the house, etc.). We've been prescribed Ativan (Lorazepam), and tried it for a while and due to its highly addictive nature, we switched him on to CBD oil - which we saw great improvements with. But lately the effects of the CBD oils are no longer lasting for more than 30 minutes, to an hour at a time, and his anxiety outbreaks have become increasingly more aggressive - he pulled the hair of his worker one day, my dads arms looks like it was put through a wood chipper, and there are no more doors left in the house for him to slam (he's literally broken them all off the hinges or in half). After an outbreak tonight before bed he hurt our mom which was a first. I can see how sad it makes my parents and I can see that they don't know what to do anymore and they're exhausted.

They've had him back on the Ativan fulltime now for about 2 weeks but we don't know if even that is working anymore.

I wish I could talk to my brother and not knowing what he's feeling makes this feel so much worse.

autism,planetbyter,2019/01/03,"Is rigid/restricted thinking and black &amp; white thinking characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder? Please, need help.  

I am trying to figure out if I am on the Autism Spectrum.

I  am in the process of getting an ""autism spectrum diagnosis"". In  particular, I struggle with rigid/restricted thinking and ""black and  white"" thinking. I view the world in extremes: either yes or no. All or  nothing.

My mind is swayed easily by  enticing ideas, so I try to compartmentalize myself so that I don't get  too distracted-- but that is far easier said than done. I have a  particular playlist of music that I have created. It's an amalgamation  of 346 songs that I have discovered over the past 5 years. I tend to  listen to only two or three songs a day, but I repeat those songs  constantly because for me there is a certain sense of comfort in the  familiar. I can listen to one song for several hours. 170 hours out of  1628 hours of listening time has just been on just one song: *183 Times*  by Greg Haines. I fast forward to ""1 minute and 46 seconds"" in the  track because everything before that time-mark is buildup. This process  repeats itself depending on the track I'm listening to.

I'm  sensitive to information that I consume. I try not to listen to certain  songs in my playlist because an influx of emotions or ideas may even  push me to change my life/career trajectory, so I hand-pick only a few  tracks that are conducive to my current worldview.  If I listen to one  song, for example, I feel overwhelmingly bombarded with emotions and  ideas. I can't even put my playlist on shuffle because I will skip 99%  of the songs because most of them simply do not fit into the worldview  that I am creating for myself.

I try not  to read any works of fiction because every time I am enthralled by a  piece of literature I immediately entertain fantasies about becoming a  novelist or a fiction writer again. I can't read philosophy without  wanting to be a philosopher. I can't consume certain pieces of art or  enjoy certain types of architecture because of the ideas associated with  them. For some reason I cannot enjoy something purely for pleasure's  sake-- only video games but that's about it.

I  specifically cannot listen to certain songs or read literature or  consume certain pieces of art from certain artists because I am  profoundly effected by the art itself or anything with ideas associated  with said topic. I would love to read ""Light in August"" by William  Faulkner or visit Japan or listen to Chopin's music without wanting to  become a novelist again, rekindle my interest in Japanese Zen or want to  be a Parisian intellectual and study at the doctoral level.

Yes,  I've learned French because I wanted to study in France to get a  doctorate in Philosophy there and I've wanted to teach ESL in Japan  because of my, once, large obsession with Zen Buddhism. Yes, I spent  everyday in the past summer writing a book because I wanted to win a  Nobel Prize in literature.

No. I am not  joking. I only think and act in extremes. These past few weeks I have  been teaching myself computer programming and calculus because I wanted  to be a Mathematician. Yes, I created a music playlist of 26 songs that  literally all in the ""electronica"" genre and I played it in the  background while I taught myself calculus.

In  other words, I'm being quite serious in saying that I have to purposely  avoid certain pieces of information or else my mind goes into a frenzy  and attaches itself to anything and everything that there is about the  subject. I wish I could be curious again, but if I start learning about  the economic history of Korea I can't clearly delineate a separation  between a ""hobby"" or fleeting interest and a lifelong pursuit.

Every  time I choose something to do with my life, I 100% dedicate all my time  and mental ability to it, even down to the music I listen to everyday,  or the art I consume in general.

When I wanted to be a writer of literary fiction, for example, I would listen to *""Like a Valley With No Echo"" by Hammock*  (specifically from 3:00 in the track to the end, on repeat) for hours  upon hours. Listening to it on the train, while writing, while  thinking-- it was enjoyable but in hindsight this is exhausting. This is  different from OCD in the sense that this wasn't compulsory in nature,  but that the music fed my mind, and that it was for the most part  enjoyable. I wasn't listening to the song because of the song, but  rather that my mind in the way that it interpreted the song fed into  this vision that I had of the future.

Honestly,  this is torture. Complete torture. I want to cry. I don't know why I  can't read a damn book and just enjoy it. I don't know why I can't just  take a computer programming class to just learn without wanting to be  neck-deep in everything ""computing."" I don't know how to stop this  ""rigid/black &amp; white thinking"" mindset. I hope this sounds like  something on the autism spectrum because my doctor has currently ruled  out OCD.

Sorry if this was an  unnecessary rant but... I don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep  living my life like this. This is something I have been dealing with for  years but I am just now coming to terms with the fact that this is a  serious, serious problem. I don't know who I am or what I am interested  in. Even when I was a little boy I studied Chemistry in 3rd grade and  when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I said ""a  Chemist"". I tried out for the basketball team in high school 3 years  straight and I knew every statistic for every player in the NBA and I  wanted to be a basketball player.

I don't know how to stop this all-or-nothing thinking and its literally killing me. Seriously.",6.535218447287416,7.14261276514446,7.169280267728546,72.61892873280807,65.33737185461325,10.230896099861617,35.922067835860936,10.161004565491616,3.7834623796210014,4519,211,792,100,66,1493,391,1073,0.069,0.7959999999999999,0.136,0.9972,3,1,4,0,0,0,135.0,0,0,2,6,33,44,4,5,65,4,75,9,0,5,14,166,138,62,1,24,44,0,1,3,0,4,6,30,0,1,52,39,2,4,31,32,2,7,28,15,0,6,19,38,101,29,156,105,15,109,2,1,6,1,31,56,1,26,50,557,153,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229386456092036,0.0,0.03210122867144099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04681498180952858,0.0,0.0,0.0776918938540276,0.0,0.044130591408821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028628527618029,0.10426910950617388,0.0401682408889895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04993695742959692,0.040663193622177865,0.0494938680787019,0.05101216873766245,0.0,0.03768959788531343,0.0,0.0518528150429602,0.030443518929329838,0.04866660051646098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04931950047894356,0.05410137347404416,0.14494990121813822,0.0,0.04830742015794498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03943397818612256,0.10619923730766123,0.04180989225166605,0.0,0.0,0.12471464483375798,0.0,0.15909003419351028,0.0,0.127275262996198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023868422451763342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07398847644332204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03164072339260378,0.04987500041837064,0.0,0.04688552279858999,0.2324386015398572,0.0,0.0,0.2664452384982661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04195824734695586,0.05222568005493313,0.0,0.155656818895949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10002751673612316,0.06918638823114279,0.04731212062117876,0.041683152444782455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04260463414185857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757184838685181,0.0,0.1906556203621853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03500213828267137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09058953371010076,0.0,0.0,0.05027211317661909,0.09596261662345336,0.1436070577496163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05111874922451402,0.1351884257076934,0.03272621736666121,0.0,0.0,0.05181725349096815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0451691052328268,0.0,0.04745437346153966,0.0,0.05020865644445074,0.2360904157555461,0.0,0.0,0.048534919401504686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13470917551081754,0.037539556179811515,0.0,0.04777429260000685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05332856240137848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453638115943303,0.0,0.052842478361151794,0.033412160479352686,0.0,0.0,0.07893150361440715,0.0,0.04934923804985785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03549251738741388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419780461089451,0.0,0.0,0.1651547707925756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16024652992930374,0.0,0.04611272742387715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3341149695946435,0.037469376838980085,0.03786525127819478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519089761494633,0.0,0.054283775379762936,0.13651269925416695,0.0,0.03436602696370361,0.0,0.0,0.06706659386234402,0.0,0.0,0.0911960133945593

There are many days that I feel super human, almost, because I can do the normal and do it well. Then there are days like today, when I have avoided a long overdue meltdown for too long, and it comes bubbling out of me. Today was a bad day. Today, I pulled my hair out and hit my head on the wall. Today, I melted down in epic proportion. I don't have a point and I don't want to talk about how I got there. I just want to vent to people who will understand, and not expect me to suck it up. Today, I had a meltdown. Today, I felt like nothing. Today, I got an Ativan coma and a heaping load of guilt. Today, I don't love my autism. 
Maybe tomorrow will be better.

autism,PORANON,2019/01/04,"I’m totally incapable of opening up ‘emotionally’ to anyone. Any advice appreciated. I am an 18 year male old from England. I should probably say at the start of my post that I’m definitely high-functioning, even definitely on the higher-end of high-functioning, if that’s a thing. If you think my problem is potentially related to autism tell me please.

Since around the time I started secondary school, I noticed I literally could not show any ‘love’ emotion, or ‘attraction’ emotion (is affection a better word!?) to ANYONE, not even my own mum.

For example, I really dislike hugging people, and if I do it’s reluctant and half-assed, and I cannot tell anyone I love them, I don’t know why, I just cant... This is a problem with girls do, I am a kiss-less virgin. Even when girls have literally told me to my face that they like me I will always awkwardly reject them, even if I don’t want to... Even when my friends are talking about ‘hot’ girls, I don’t really join in the conversation, I just don’t feel comfortable. 

I don’t know why I can’t open up to people, maybe you could say I have some sort of fear of relationships, but I can *talk* to girls fine, and the problem extends to my family too, so i don’t think that is the reason. (MAYBE the family and ‘other girls’ issues are separate?)",4.758093466635668,5.614319308300395,6.211746105556848,77.03455010462686,69.35573122529644,10.063613113229485,29.506858870030232,10.194018383442646,2.926610044175774,1007,37,199,26,17,343,135,253,0.08800000000000001,0.7959999999999999,0.116,0.552,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,0,2,3,1,13,15,0,2,12,0,26,5,1,2,1,37,39,14,0,11,10,1,2,1,1,2,0,2,0,6,8,9,0,0,6,1,0,0,11,6,0,0,1,4,35,9,23,34,3,16,0,1,0,4,24,8,0,7,8,131,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10078641556897763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582006224813629,0.0,0.0,0.14027636195080062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2163519437816621,0.0,0.0,0.09181573930902448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09121822551130078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16469648962202887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3480530948817356,0.09135070247071964,0.0,0.0,0.3406122869611113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19446088444535609,0.11606025484798382,0.0521502697187552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07968507664500449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21794441834583012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076505102551886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336519489145468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05038859486716308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18617427827557714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072343435818716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174246430156494,0.10822722228252313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14300744559009654,0.0,0.0,0.11321585040235704,0.0,0.0,0.0987788266473198,0.0,0.11120148324652236,0.29607080555163323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214720283315246,0.1060442575407627,0.0,0.11073288337313332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640408354474138,0.0,0.10438235915038556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531779767480799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14600488862688513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16579873629555367,0.1802963833080967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06852108999281799,0.13217484729145335,0.0,0.0,0.0601412868095081,0.0,0.0,0.09855390892671778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060834162153809386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18613414008323334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641825205684572
autism,gaythrowawayiguess,2019/01/04,I'm about to have a meltdown and idk why I woke up today and immediately felt on the verge of meltdown. I don't know why. I've been having dreams where I either meltdown or go into sensory overload. I think it might be because my routine has been non existent for two weeks. I want school to start back up again. ,3.147656249999997,4.5802397031250015,4.52075,85.44925000000002,73.84375,6.995000000000001,26.8625,7.554174236665415,1.39031625,247,9,51,3,5,82,51,64,0.066,0.866,0.068,0.0258,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,10,16,3,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,3,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,4,1,6,0,9,10,1,12,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,5,34,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2250712006011571,0.0,0.1784295561122382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28104160743534584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1663503488474981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16086238644021578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3105125395658417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962319327597507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20717729845519856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875528144509632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2774490340597932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2859291394216631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17264432016409806,0.0,0.2347893806505395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5282394124661507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,zun21,2019/01/04,"I want some help with my brother Hi , I really wanted to ask for help , for so long.
My brother have only been diagnosed , but never received therapy. I know I hate my parents for that. In result , now he is struggling with life so hard , and my parents only scold him on all his wrongs, when the reality is , it’s their fault and really don’t understand him. I really want to help but somehow I feel it’s so out of my reach because I don’t live with my parents.
He has struggles at expressing verbally and corporally , he doesn’t do anything , expends all his time on the computer. He is 27 and my parents are desperate because they want him to get a job. How can I reach him  , I really hate  seeing him this way  , I know he is hurting . What advices can you give me ?

Does this happen to anyone else?",3.605666666666668,4.911568900000006,4.949999999999998,83.32166666666669,72.5,8.333333333333334,24.583333333333336,8.841846274778883,1.7304583333333332,312,9,62,6,6,104,56,80,0.067,0.89,0.043,-0.1917,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,3,0,9,2,1,1,1,11,13,2,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,5,2,0,0,3,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,5,1,12,11,2,6,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,42,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11235146932146296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310435242391937,0.3385633896634015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18443392958176416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1732241733785076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2130992628371842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28916050017168554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2760308918856414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09389516081434388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2921971274744718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17455810295503513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071541907189286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4856251523267169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1698679375786352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33683058533119176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17172103921901952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063926680814138

He has breakdowns at least once a week and he gets very aggressive. If a sales person knocks on the door it sets off. He says he wants to grab a knife and kill them. The parents do nothing and tell me to do the same (when hes having an episide). 

The younger sister (15) tells me she is afraid of him and as a result she mainly hides in her room or asks to hang of with me.

autism,WildRosa13474,2019/01/05,"I managed to avoid a shutdown! Yesterday I came home after a three-day sleepover--which was so much fun. But also exhausting, as you would expect.

I knew I would likely enter a shutdown afterwards, even when I went into it.

I actually managed to avoid this by recognizing the signs of the impending shutdown and discracting and secluding myself. 

When I got home I went straight up to my room, taking my dinner up with me and saying maybe two words to my mom. Dinner actually helped with the exhaustion a bit. Then I just crawled into bed with the lights off and headphones on and read a book.

It actually worked. When I finally fell asleep I slept for ten hours straight, but I managed to avoid a shutdown.

I'm pretty happy with that.

autism,TedbundyUk,2019/01/05,"Understanding autism. Long story hang in there. I have a brother who has been diagnosed with autism and I’m very skeptical. I’m hoping someone might have the same experience as me and help me with either accepting his issue or tell me that I’m being reasonable. 

He sees the world around him as a constant battle against him and that no matter what he does it’s the situation it is never his fault.

So my bro claims to be autist yet he spends £400 on cannabis a month. He can never hold a job down, so for instance works hard for like 60-70 hours a week but lasts around 2 months. Reasons for jobs ending....

Smoking weed on a factory line. Arguing with people , banging his hand and claiming it’s the factories fault and suing them. Started his own company as a painter decorator got loans and investment , bought the tools started and then found it was too much effort and quit ( usually stating it was everyone else’s fault but his)

He can manage to go on the piss and socialise till 6 am though and has 3 kids( who he walked out on so he can spend more time on world of Warcraft) 

He claimed he was disabled for 2 years to get his autism card stating it’s why he couldn’t work to then pick up work an got sacked for fooling around. 

He does struggle to socialise because everything is about him ie not being able to bring up his kids cause his childhood was bad and that stops him being able to bond.Usually better with females. 

He knows when everyone’s pay day is and calls asking for money. 

He has gambled everything in the passed.

He knows every system IE if he gets in debt with utilities he can get a free white goods. 

He now has a flat and gets maximum benefits of government. But claims to be depressed and no one will help him( his version of help it to be constantly given money and people visit him all the time ) sit on his own playing games all day even though he has someone who wants him that he had 3 kids with. He just doesn’t want to parent because “being autistic makes it difficult “

I refuse to support him financially as he makes more than me on benefits and I work 2 jobs one of which is academic. He complains I don’t see his kids enough but I’m always working. 

I do not for one second think he’s autistic just delusional however I keep getting told doctors wouldn’t get it wrong in the uk as you have to see a specialist to get diagnosed but surely they can manipulated.

Just here to see wether I’m being an asshole or justifying my actions- fire away.

autism,Anxiloli,2019/01/05,"I made the following post on my Facebook page, where I have family and coworkers. How badly did I mess up?  

I started drinking at the age of 14.  
Before then, I always struggled socially, not having a single friend aside from my internet friends.  
The first time I got drunk I realised that it was although I could suddenly speak to people normally without the fear of messing up, and my social skills drastically improved. From then on, whenever I felt the need to socialise or make friends, I always relied on having at least a little bit of alcohol in me. I suppose I eventually started to think of myself as “normal” and cured of my social anxiety, not realising it was just the alcohol. I gained many friends that I saw on a somewhat regular basis, going out partying and drinking. It was fun.

I’m 20 now and I’ve gained more of a tolerance to alcohol. I need to drink a lot more now to get the same social-boosting affects, but I just end up drinking too much and getting sick. It isn’t sustainable and I need to stop, but that also means the end of the social life that I had built previously.

I have started to realise that I’m not neurotypical. I’ve just been masking it from everyone for so long. It is likely that I’m on the spectrum, as I have the following traits (and have had them for as long as I can remember):  
• Social anxiety (I have had severe episodes of hyperventilating and having panic attacks as a result of it)  
• IBS  
• Trichotillomania (I pull my hair out)  
• Stimming (Leg bounce, rubbing my hands together a lot)  
• Dyscalculia (I have never passed a maths class, and I struggle to do basic math, including counting money)  
• An usual, monotonous voice (which I am able to mask although it is difficult)  
• Sensory issues, namely bright lights, certain sounds, textures, and an aversion to the taste of certain foods (This is why I don’t eat meat)  
• Difficulty speaking on the phone  
• Special interests that I stick to in conversation. My special interests are spiders and video games.  
• A tendency to either stare or avoid eye contact completely  
• An aversion to touch unless it’s a romantic partner  
• I cannot read an analog clock, or ride a bike  
• A tendency to say socially inappropriate things and act rude unintentionally

And lastly, I experience meltdowns if I mask for too long or experience too much stimulation, either in the form of a shutdown or a violent outburst. I have spent days in a state of catatonia, barely moving and unable to speak, and I have also self-harmed by bashing my head against walls (or a window) or hitting myself repeatedly and crying for hours. (This is not an extensive list, just the traits that I feel are most telling.)

I’m going to stop using alcohol as a social crutch as it is no longer healthy for me. It also means that I will be socialising less as I am struggling to cope with the constant masking and social energy expenditure that is necessary for my 8-5 office job.",4.657697974217314,6.782599152854518,5.957620626151012,73.84147697974217,71.28360957642725,8.951896869244939,31.95616942909761,9.50193526645192,3.363154401473297,2312,108,391,56,45,775,275,543,0.126,0.784,0.09,-0.9751,1,1,8,0,0,0,68.0,0,0,1,4,15,26,3,6,38,0,37,19,5,7,3,74,65,46,0,7,22,0,6,1,5,1,6,6,1,1,25,21,12,3,6,9,2,9,10,13,0,1,13,18,50,13,69,48,17,57,0,0,4,0,24,20,0,12,27,288,75,5,0.06562460364886243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2805309743370221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15743991548543707,0.10920985462648704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10040528433788136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07465746052596531,0.0,0.0,0.05479380290527447,0.0,0.0,0.05584170422473482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164507056122794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880614836549903,0.07091688297686048,0.0,0.05239590609101751,0.0,0.07208554561428558,0.04232244036551134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25714851211338435,0.0,0.0671503527330476,0.0,0.0,0.1162478408371396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06270712106709424,0.0,0.12838690948549816,0.0618650358799892,0.07384592383080336,0.033181771403580085,0.0,0.06300991081502534,0.0,0.0,0.05582025433937807,0.07935353122177591,0.0,0.20280562396097312,0.0,0.06857229370180147,0.0,0.07459194914646614,0.0,0.052485990459628366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0673497760423439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06462701552438446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06849503640211825,0.06512229307903686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0534928107729952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04635259830728939,0.03206086651606533,0.06577309305812883,0.0,0.17422712743019486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11158338252845684,0.0,0.062095586709088275,0.043804932519014336,0.06653304791111428,0.0,0.14296886377080742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0697485680999829,0.09648326909117304,0.14597943623789394,0.05061373996248971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12859635630645344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699633277119405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04549583726193017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06285022997966322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564236259860537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433988318222891,0.0,0.0,0.05218731880029775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06846077380001261,0.07413712282243302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6020641720692499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393482966919384,0.0,0.0,0.10973021425136634,0.0,0.205815253088534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057358796110597736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04359807066631787,0.04204959621283432,0.0,0.0,0.038266234126734605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05667858726557307,0.0722762295450528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059215997538959876,0.0,0.0,0.06325977609806105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,arcticfoxarrow,2019/01/05,"Diagnosed and ignored I went through extensive testing and diagnosed with Aspergers when I was 15 or 16. My parents chose to ignore the diagnosis because they said it was “bullshit” and said “you don’t have that”. So instead of getting the support and help I needed at the time they chose to not believe the results. I ignored the results as well, thinking that if my parents said it wasn’t true then it must not be true. I’m 27 now and I just recently, maybe within the last 5 years, started realizing that it was true. Things in my life are difficult to handle as someone on the spectrum. Work has been challenging, relationships are challenging, and I’m constantly realizing that the underlying reason for most of what I do is because I have Aspergers. I was never given any support that could have helped me through my diagnosis, and now I don’t know what to do with this information. I don’t know my next step. Most of the people in my life don’t even know because I don’t even talk about it.

autism,MuppetMurderer5,2019/01/05,"I just took the Ritvo test for determining Aspergers So a little pre note. I have been talking with a clinical psychologist for about 6 years now, and he believes I’m right on the border of Aspergers and Neurotypical. I don’t believe his diagnosis, but he has been talking to me on and off for 6 years.

Well I just took the Ritvo test and I got a total score of 196.0

Language: 15, Social relatedness: 90, sensory/motor: 50, and circumscribed interests: 41.

I’m not too sure what to do with this information. It is certainly alarming, especially after what my doctor said about what he thinks about my situation. Certainly his way of conducting sessions aren’t orthodox, and he doesn’t go straight to tests, he asks probing questions that can lead to answers that falls in line with a certain issue one has. 

So who should I bring this up with? The doctor I talk to I can’t talk to because I’m at college. My college does offer counselors and guidance but I’m not sure about that.",4.8693735676088625,6.4782441764705885,5.962601222307104,76.10423796791446,69.80213903743315,9.193124522536287,32.07372039724981,9.606745405546679,3.1828062643239114,779,35,141,18,14,259,110,187,0.037000000000000005,0.871,0.092,0.8662,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,1,11,8,0,1,8,0,13,3,0,1,6,29,25,11,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,10,11,0,0,4,0,0,6,6,1,1,1,6,1,14,7,27,18,1,20,1,0,0,0,18,9,0,1,4,92,24,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14370321187097634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09370352213609402,0.0,0.0,0.3463693863497728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31466858854534,0.13451744131223514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736004244595759,0.0,0.12294030138206907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604390113382617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15406328074568812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10416157883604348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17219650282324775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312721691947196,0.14621860989854593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17278262568076674,0.0,0.15669356107612345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2897500175815307,0.0,0.0,0.4942026799377792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849466469298226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3415670802113613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220121830837087,0.0,0.0,0.13820866559615422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1979754423746856
autism,persephoneswrath,2019/01/06,"Do you mention your autism at your workplace? Hello, guys!

I am a woman who is considered a high functioning autistic and lives independently of her parents with roommates. I was diagnosed late at the age of 17. At the job I am at, I have never mentioned my condition. They are fairly accepting of my quirks, mind you, but I am curious about experiences of those who have autism.

Do you mention that you are autistic at the workplace? What were the results (positive or negative)? Were you treated differently, either negatively or positively?

autism,greengod210,2019/01/06,"Siblings of severely autistic teenagers, how do you deal with their constant meltdowns and crying? I live at home with my mom and my severely autistic sister (17 years old) who cannot speak and likely never will, and constantly has meltdowns and cries, at least a couple of times a day.  She is wailing loudly now as usual, and I have headphones in blasting music, which is what I usually do when she does this.  With regular crying it helps, but with meltdowns and bloodcurdling screaming, it doesn't do crap.  My mental health is severely in the gutter having to live with a sibling like this, and I get so jealous of seeing how close my cousins and friends are with their siblings, even if there is a significant age gap.  They have normal, calm family dinners and do stuff together.  My family's whole life revolves around my sister and making sure she doesn't have a meltdown and embarrass us at family gatherings and elsewhere.  I love my sister out of obligation, but I do not plan on taking care of her besides picking her up for the occasional holiday if she calms down one day, and my parents support this.  I am visibly nervous when the clock shows 6, because that's when she comes home every night and I am praying that she walks in calmly.  I also am anxious as all heck coming home whenever I have been out and she is still awake, because I have no clue what I am going to walk into-calm behavior or a meltdown.  She is probably not going to calm down anytime soon, even though she was much worse a few years ago (if you can believe it), and putting her in a home is not an option until she is 21.  I am going to get an apartment as soon as I can afford to do so without a roommate, and my dad is involved and takes me out a lot so I can have some quiet time, as do my grandparents, but the tension of having a sibling like this stays with me most of the day.  For the other siblings of kids like this on Reddit, how do you deal with your sibling's behavior?  And has it affected you to that degree where you are anxious walking through the doors of your own home, instead of relaxed and content?",9.71014705882353,6.8604930539215685,9.243039215686274,71.54117647058824,60.862745098039206,11.952941176470587,40.911764705882355,9.916854025145753,4.0089764705882365,1658,69,307,24,17,535,201,408,0.101,0.764,0.136,0.9629,3,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,1,7,3,1,21,20,2,3,20,0,43,5,1,6,3,61,57,45,0,4,11,7,0,4,1,1,2,4,6,1,18,36,1,0,0,3,0,9,9,6,0,1,2,5,51,14,50,54,9,54,1,0,1,1,41,19,2,8,29,245,69,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0764987960627637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06901322458300455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949864578435559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07682434573968869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10521405565738022,0.0,0.0,0.09722934384603038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879875124943045,0.0,0.0,0.14867777663532486,0.0,0.18651697404124046,0.0,0.0,0.09548812660684504,0.28438597289608863,0.16696701503910674,0.17794081862868305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07552077677804915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11399926110104093,0.0,0.07271057208547806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2440648574836555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06667434063636314,0.0,0.09017526001883393,0.0,0.14713701510798766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917317289853967,0.0,0.0,0.05784435488337932,0.0,0.4328243249103689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06095548769427515,0.16864519580387693,0.0,0.1524070757015381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336826573893837,0.07788815528643328,0.0,0.05760520709993134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696902553089582,0.0,0.0,0.10107226591400356,0.0,0.0,0.06343964455672772,0.0,0.06655905636598604,0.0,0.0,0.0809857014460819,0.08455463016766789,0.0,0.0,0.09055621188317843,0.0,0.058478389622851935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09582475097594308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930448445984179,0.0,0.0,0.08675426238577624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06876907548571892,0.0,0.0,0.2924796867653339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09198317886254094,0.06891843841384253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09879163007459467,0.0,0.0979310051201438,0.08133572191734917,0.0,0.12977211336084624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08478826233172113,0.0,0.10064320226258423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10380698925042736,0.0,0.1900921623170041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09634967544425192,0.0,0.08318909067243299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087945984230104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11114736531755794

autism,H3LL0FRI3ND_exe_file,2019/01/06,"Could you help me out for a second? There are some signs that might point towards the possibility that I have some type of autism, or at least problems with social skills. First, I want to say that I am a high functioning person. I have a group of very good friends that I have known for many years. I do have difficulties making new friends. It’s not like I need new friends right now, but when I’m going to study at a university, then I will probably have to make at least one new friend. The problem is that I’m horrible at small talk. I can think of a couple of things to say, but the conversation doesn’t go smoothly at all. It’s quite awkward at times. 
Also, I think I’m a bit sensitive to sounds. One of my teachers does this thing called upspeak, only more severe. It’s quite extreme because she starts sentences by talking in a normal way, but at the end of each sentence she reaches this extremely high pitch and it’s so uncomfortable to listen to. I hate it. My teachers tell me that I speak in the complete opposite way. They say I have a monotone voice. A voice that is quite boring to listen to. Do I talk in a monotone way because I’m sensitive to sounds? I was surprised to hear that I talk that way because I thought I just talked like a normal person. Sometimes I’m also told to speak up because apparently I don’t talk loud enough. 
Something I also want to mention is that I almost always understand jokes, but occasionally I fail to detect sarcasm. 
I feel more comfortable working alone (I don’t know if that has anything to do with autism, but I thought I’d mention it anyway). 
Are these signs of autism? 
I’m diagnosed with bipolar so I have been so busy worrying about that that I forgot worrying about my social skills.

Specifically, females that had speech delay in early childhood (aged 3-5) who maybe today would be diagnosed with level 1 or 2 (mild-moderate) autism.  How old are you now and what is life like for you.  How is/was school for you?  Are you employed? Do you live independently or do you plan to?  How is/was dating for you? Is there anything you would tell a young female with autism either to work on, or something you wish you knew earlier, to help them have an easier time?",3.7258333333333336,6.122341398148151,4.136814814814816,84.6396666666667,74.83333333333334,6.912592592592592,25.61481481481481,7.908726449838941,1.563074814814815,453,16,84,7,10,142,73,108,0.021,0.872,0.107,0.8541,1,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,10,1,2,7,1,0,0,2,0,11,2,0,4,0,19,15,7,0,3,4,0,0,1,0,2,2,1,0,1,3,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,11,1,15,10,1,13,0,0,1,0,17,3,0,4,11,53,14,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20574732352653172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2537677094075873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16758490054838765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17659837962958688,0.12214842927946995,0.0,0.22077456543345167,0.0,0.2099560417847748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511813400236694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26235669484217417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21831011918203025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2800825691594893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530362525154286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19247963776852905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21853080130445365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579020784353766,0.0,0.2369922215625984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875136887842172,0.0,0.0,0.1820194544699232,0.0,0.0,0.3552178097535941,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Equadex,2019/01/06,"How can autistic people be considered equals if they are labeled as a risk? Everyone is talking about risk factors for autistic people to get born. That minds like mine is a risk to come into existance. That autistic traits are undesirable yet neurotypical traits somehow are not. The logical conclusion that there should be no autism since autism is bad.

How can I be equal if others find my traits less legitimate than their own. If I have kids they will talk about the risk of them inheriting my traits, of being like me. If I meet other people they will talk about how they find my eye contact lacking, like staring people into their eyes are the only legitimate way of talking to someone. 

To me it seems that at every turn I am deemed lesser. That a need for predictability and structure is too much to ask. That their way is the only way. 

How can I be a true equal to other people if all my defining traits are considered risks for their development?

autism,scapegoat101_,2019/01/06,"Am I on the Autism spectrum? Hi everyone. So I am not sure how to write this but the only reason I suspect so is because a couple years ago I was being made fun of behind my back for being ""autistic."" It never crossed my mind and now reading up on Autism and Asperger's, I am genuinely confused. I have some questions I would appreciate people answering and I hope I don't offend anyone by them: 

- Firstly, what are the differences between the two? I thought to be Autistic you had to have a lower IQ than average (or else you would be placed in the Asperger's category) so why do so many people with normal IQs get diagnosed on an Autism ""spectrum""?  

- What benefit would I receieve with getting an official diagnosis if there is no treatment for it? 

-I am able to go about life almost like any normal person so what, if any, is the purpose of diagnosing someone on the austism spectrum if they can still function pretty normally save for a few quirks? 

-Is Autism/Asperger's something I should worry about if I have it?

A little bit about myself. I have a normal education, I am pretty smart, and I can take care of myself. I however come from a very rough household that has in some way affected me: 
- I do not make or keep friends easily.
- I prefer to keep to myself and read books and make art (I can go weeks without leaving the house)
- I LACK EMPATHY: this one is huge for me because I realized it from a very young age. I had to teach myself how to respond appriopriately in situations that call for empathy. 
- I hate the sound of loud cars, especially at night.
- I have mild OCD behaviors that have gotten better with time.
- Sometimes in very stressful situations I become mute. 

I don't know what to add but these always struck me as unusual. What do you guys think? Appreciate all the input :)",3.6225484496124074,5.7365546075581415,5.107000000000003,78.87133333333334,74.1453488372093,8.075038759689923,28.617829457364344,8.841846274778883,2.511238294573644,1411,59,257,30,30,473,193,344,0.093,0.736,0.17,0.9862,2,0,1,0,0,0,50.0,0,3,2,2,14,14,2,2,19,0,37,3,0,7,3,59,55,22,0,15,11,0,1,1,1,4,3,2,0,2,15,11,0,2,9,4,0,5,7,4,0,3,6,3,42,10,42,41,6,31,0,0,0,0,13,13,0,12,13,192,57,4,0.09935269670792113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08807017103287944,0.0,0.09948737428567772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08266940263958157,0.0,0.0,0.1351264814210532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06946971560343884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639609109241767,0.0,0.12112896350951548,0.10972724776895043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08786938642689739,0.10846741268220488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10145021163620936,0.0,0.10129669580385628,0.0,0.0,0.08558355092489446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993186918882172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20168179160140792,0.0,0.10380242191621436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08299642943987841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949357593706991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450935306540908,0.0,0.0,0.07675964702151973,0.0,0.10381536679710936,0.0,0.11292885424581138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09837478994956693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09809021894674076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09867964541488752,0.0,0.11463967265253905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17661848362933333,0.0,0.0,0.054601643813185566,0.0,0.0,0.10520016041676357,0.0,0.0,0.07017574789311586,0.04853870911293495,0.09957750299127974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400992387274264,0.1326373930777417,0.10072804043946568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10031790140485357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07662692460061807,0.0,0.0,0.0932357755241314,0.38937819279554015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06732395855728804,0.07556220285035185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377573004522318,0.0867509425531985,0.10380242191621436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20215482098233487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112977582456796,0.0,0.1987591659172993,0.0,0.0,0.102151119384013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22335318762902892,0.0,0.0,0.08418121750893454,0.07648655985934967,0.09826235748601073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0793431919300561,0.0,0.11380817840120107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363874085634694,0.0,0.07470086332869176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06366119636437143,0.0,0.07887494338217484,0.05793335642361123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09705314817217743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24592913952051096,0.0,0.07886154615937331,0.07969474043681236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08965035545547663,0.0,0.0,0.09577245421718604,0.0,0.0,0.10089748620155832,0.0,0.211731915519541,0.0,0.0,0.06397987927378643

autism,Fist_of_Cuervo,2019/01/07,"Autism services in Alaska? I'm thinking about moving to Alaska and my 2 year old is currently having 2 therapy sessions a week. He's currently in child development, and speech therapy. I'm unsure where in Alaska we would move to, but we currently reside in California. I know here, they have programs for when he's of the age to be in school, but idk anything about if Alaska has the same or not. Could be my ignorance of Alaska as I've never looked into anything before.

autism,goddess_of_fear,2019/01/07,"Haircut Days are Heck for us... Ds's hair is too long for school. School starts back up tomorrow and I waited until today to get it done. Went to two salons. The first one just asked us to leave and said they wouldn't cut his hair because he was already upset. The second one was amazing. The hairdresser has a lot of moms bring in their autistic kids. He still got upset but not as much as usual. Previously I could not get him trimmed without having his father take him and hold him still during the process. DS actually sat by himself on the chair this time! He still pitches a fit when it comes time to trim around his ears or the back of his neck but hopefully he will be ok next time. I am definitely taking him back to that hairdresser, but does anyone have any tips on how to help him keep calm next time. I would let him grow those beautiful curls out but his school is pretty strict about stuff like that.",3.796219415943174,5.332625011049722,3.9250710339384414,89.94896408839779,72.37016574585634,6.939384372533546,22.87332280978689,7.447530270364453,0.7037289660615631,721,18,151,8,14,222,123,181,0.023,0.794,0.183,0.9872,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,2,0,2,1,12,8,1,2,8,1,16,4,4,1,0,24,31,13,0,4,9,2,2,1,0,3,0,2,0,1,7,6,0,3,0,0,0,4,4,3,0,5,7,4,20,5,22,18,2,32,0,0,0,0,26,7,1,3,22,100,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.1178967069322762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333208806919568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08215743331611611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844757218149519,0.0,0.0,0.10754977352915343,0.1129444657081478,0.0,0.0,0.2786947470339149,0.0,0.07364688725353563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407027259385056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964598787375596,0.0,0.0,0.07791481758981719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10572485012428624,0.12363432225355415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276403952863827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262403044188608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662572236773287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08097885127101682,0.0,0.0,0.11999522673234445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073847342028822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12792422437691572,0.0,0.12354015519074125,0.0,0.05902345291993956,0.0,0.0,0.10691628944900246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271145544390996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14149550125636387,0.0,0.0,0.08881194286983987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569734011492554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16373292866295508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229109279670765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492145900264875,0.0,0.0,0.36680962887893337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08551253207862232,0.0,0.2894458405870587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383027390444733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1816736773737111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817896724370744,0.0,0.11451722559434464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801739326326426,0.0,0.2906479209717241,0.0,0.1330591807194459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11199547543477398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164600593180741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582255946306792,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Andrea_Libutti_MD,2019/01/07,"How To Build Up Your Child's Self Esteem Not too long ago, my autistic son, Jack, was working with one of his teachers and he created something SPECTACULAR. It was a creative project that he put together with puzzles and numbers and shapes, and I thought it was wonderful!

https://i.redd.it/x2hqiojxc2921.jpg

He was outside with one of his teachers and the doors were open. Inside the house, I was sharing with another person how excited I was that Jack had put together his project so well.

**Unbeknownst to me, Jack could hear EVERYTHING I was saying as I raved about him.**

His teacher described his reaction to me later, saying that when he heard me talking about him, ***his face lit up***!

To her, his reaction was so authentic that tears came to her eyes.

Truly, as parents, we don’t fully understand the depth of what our children are feeling and seeing every day.

It can be difficult to remember that they have such a depth of feeling on the inside when the outside looks so different, but they are very sensitive and heartfelt beings.

**It’s important for all kids to overhear their parents saying good things about THEM, and it’s a wonderful way to build self-esteem in a young person.**

When we demonstrate respect for who they are, respect for what they’re doing, and when we believe and expect that they can achieve what they set their mind to, it makes a HUGE difference.

autism,throwawayradiodude,2019/01/07,"I [22M] Have A [32M] Colleague On The Spectrum, and I'm Not Sure How To Help Him. I want to make him feel more comfortable on the job.  

A little subtext to the title. Apologies if I worded that wrong, still new to this whole thing.

I work at a REALLY small radio station in the middle of nowhere, Canada. I really hope that's not a real place...

My colleague and I have been working together for almost 7-8 months now and early on, he told me he's autistic.

Frankly I don't see him as different, don't treat him differently than any one, but as the months have gone on, I've found it difficult to help him.

He's in charge of the station and often gets very overwhelmed by a lot of the stress and tends to lash out at me as a way to calm himself. That or he'll lock himself into his office all day, not speaking to a single person.

I understand that's probably a mechanism to help him cope, but my other Colleague and I are frightened by how quickly he can snap. We want to help him feel comfortable and safe, but at the same time, it's becoming a larger and larger challenge.

With that in mind [/r/autism](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism), I was hoping for your help.

Teach me how I can help him.

How I can explain to him how I'm feeling in a professional manner, and also have him understand our feelings.

Often it feels like it's him against the world, when we want him to be a team with us.

TLDR:I \[22M\] Have A \[32M\] Colleague On The Spectrum, and I'm Not Sure How To Help Him. He snaps on me often, and I want to help him feel more comfortable on the job.

autism,teacup18,2019/01/07,"Advice and insight please My son who is 4 years old, non verbal autistic started school today. He was crying when we left the classroom. 

He cries when he gets to new daycares too. I know he has separation anxiety. We've only done the drop off and leave right away method at new daycares. Because base on experience its what usually works (i worked in daycare settings before i had him). 

Anyways, does anyone have other suggestions? I know it's only his first day, and its a whole new world. He does have a one and one worker, so there is someone who can take him from me at drop off. 

Thanks any advice is welcome.",3.1727889060092416,5.4587561864406755,3.893636363636365,86.25359784283516,76.11864406779661,5.985824345146379,25.134052388289675,6.980632752743323,1.1130067796610166,482,17,90,5,11,153,87,118,0.106,0.8270000000000001,0.067,-0.4019,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,1,0,0,4,6,2,0,0,4,0,10,0,0,0,0,8,16,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,10,2,9,13,1,25,0,0,0,0,14,10,0,0,12,54,17,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842295799735129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09889897168284864,0.0,0.11125533460441824,0.0,0.0,0.10168966680737683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366384616450061,0.0,0.0,0.0886541986893912,0.0,0.12375220147770405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3195011716901682,0.09379182171916864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545376245721669,0.14882776691106672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14226072529777425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12370466584871145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07598239007733233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598516106843845,0.0,0.0,0.15399183900406993,0.1580126523870128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4213783525146719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15260676628592204,0.0,0.1970974216426869,0.2212156812314152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15964102614693493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241984154370781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14718528251286744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232243415071519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293775191384172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10934701309964813,0.0,0.0,0.13389455027926545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785284415685156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601731652872139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16237000307846045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2117529370805089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09365365251913416

autism,Vaidif,2019/01/07,"The Concept of the Flying Anchor Here we have a person, the **'flying ancho**r' which means so much as this; imagine a group situation which finds itself in the predicament of having lost momentum. This group can be a group of people doing a sport together, a book reading club or any other social group where people come together with a shared goal.

Imagine that life has drained out of the group and they need someone to pull them forward. Maybe the old leadership has gone. However, no one feels energetic enough to be that fearless vanguard of shared interests in which all group members find glory when being replenished by positive progressive action.

Here comes the 'flying anchor', the person who will step up to announce they will do it. To great relieve of the others who have great hopes in his success, he will start taking action.  Perhaps he will build the desired website, organize and plan activities, contact the media or do whatever used to be done by another, perhaps.

He starts motivated but cannot keep that up. And as all participants in the group expect much, the flying anchor cannot deliver.  The heights that were perceived by the groups participants to be achieved cannot be met even though this was need for the invigoration. The flying anchor does some, but not enough and as such is a drag on the required actions that are needed. 

Because the flying anchor cannot deliver on the perceived goal, the group cannot move forward and gain that renewed momentum that would revitalize them all.

Hence this person is named the 'flying anchor'. *He takes off well-intended but then cannot deliver the expected results while the group required big steps in moving forward, in fact therefore being the anchor on that progress.*

Aside from that, she also has other minor problems. she gets confused by things in the wrong shelf and hates it when something is sold out, as she wants to get everything from the list. I am sure she will also encounter more problems when she comes with me more often.

autism,zoeleigh13,2019/01/07,"Possible autism and eye contact Back when the slime trend first started getting really big on instagram I realized that I really enjoyed it, and eventually started looking for slime stuff on tumblr. There I started getting into the stimming community, and by connection, the autism community. I realized that a lot of things about me that seem odd or quirky or whatever could be explained by asd. I did a lot of research, particularly research into how autism impacts and is different in women, and have come to the conclusion that there is a pretty good chance I'm on the spectrum. 

Go forward to a couple months ago, and my therapist suggests that I might have ADHD too/instead. I still haven't really looked too much into it, but from what I've read in correlation to autism, ADHD seems like a good possibility as well. 

I know that if I have asd then it is a relatively mild case, but something that I keep wondering about is eye contact. Almost everyone and everything I've seen that discusses the struggles of autism includes something about eye contact. I do find it extremely uncomfortable having to make eye contact, though I don't have a problem with close friends and family. However, in most cases, I'm able to maintain some kind of eye contact. I watched a video of autism for my psych class last semester and the video mentioned a new autism screening for babies that measures where and how much they look at a video of a person talking. Babies who don't look at the eyes very much are flagged as a high risk for autism (or something like that). 

It just seems that lack of eye contact is a must in a the list of criteria for having asd, and I just wonder if I've adapted to make eye contact (since we know that females are under diagnosed with asd because they learn to cope and adapt to societal norms) or if I really don't have autism, but instead ADHD with some sort of sensory disorder.

autism,just_boof_it8,2019/01/08,"Autism and the Default Mode Network I honestly have no doubts that I’m diagnosed correctly as autistic, I’m just trying to get to the core of it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20150873/

In this article, it is established that the endogenously produced chemical named bufotenin is visible in human urine with a high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

In autistic subjects, the amount of bufotenin was over double the amount in neurotypical subjects. I think the implications of this are huge.

In the Wikipedia page about bufotenin, it is referenced that its chemical structure is very similar to the structures of DMT and psilocin.

I believe that the way serotonin is effected by those chemicals plays a role in the Default Mode Network in the brain, which is where information is processed.",10.024242424242424,12.29384566666667,8.098181818181818,63.125606060606096,58.24242424242424,11.92727272727273,44.96969696969697,11.645159339076185,6.209842424242425,676,40,90,20,9,201,83,132,0.034,0.909,0.057,0.4404,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,1,13,0,10,3,2,2,1,11,14,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,12,3,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,3,2,19,13,4,12,0,0,0,0,4,11,0,1,0,63,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4223107075098745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4184398465727411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3804496540563363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19583582667567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3960337774300486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24017914499197185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544883730751165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30927814656289376,0.0,0.29752659093764144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My has high functioning autism so his traits are not as extreme as most cases, but I notice it a bit. He's a good dude and seems to really enjoy my presence however he sometimes says things that make me worried.

He knows a lot about tech and physics and he often boasts his intelligence compared to other people. He often refers to people being inferior than him and him having the ability to have power over them. Sometimes he takes it to a point where he claims that he is a god compared to him.

It worried me because these things sound kinda anti social personality or narcissistic. Or maybe these are attempts at humor.

autism,Muhnamajeff,2019/01/08,"Looking for some extra information on Multiple Complex Developmental Disorder (MCDD) I’ve taken a great interest in this disorder, but I am very dissapointed in the lack of information on it. Here are some questions I have in mind, that I am posting here in hopes someone that knows more than the average person who just had a look on Google


1. Can you get officially diagnosed with MCDD? Or is it still in some sort of research phase where there isn’t enough information gathered on it for official diagnoses?




2. How “high-functioning” would someone with this disorder be? Could you go past your childhood undiagnosed, or does it affect the sufferer so much to the point where it would be impossible for it to go under the radar?


Thank you. While these are the main questions I would like to be answered, I would also appreciate extra things such as more obscure symptoms or info similar to that.

autism,yoricake,2019/01/08,"any tips on how to find a comfortable job? I'm 18 and I've worked at a fast food place for a few weeks -- I just discovered that that kind of job is absolute hell for me. I could barely understand instructions, and the ""fast pace"" screwed me over. I'm a very, very, slow person (hehe) but mentally and physically. So I've ruled fast food joints a no-go for me. I'm thinking of office work, because I consider myself very good at speeding through packages/research/etc. and feeling less stressed because of it. But I'm not completely sure because well, I've never worked in an office.

autism,Chaserly,2019/01/08,"Difficulty at current job, need some advice please. Hi!

I currently work as an Emergency Medical Technician in NYC. I started out as Full-Time, but I've dropped all the way down to 1 12 Hour Shift per week. My parents want me to work and I know they'll most likely understand, but they help me financially with everything else... I feel like the least I can do is hold down a job 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got hired (a little over 2 years ago) they told me that it wasn't stressful and I would get free time to do homework and study. However, for about 2 years this has not been the case. I get no breaks and no free time. There's also favoritism so... while I may be working like a dog, there can be other people just sitting around for the majority of their shift. Totally not fair. I also get headaches when I'm stressed and don't nap (so this is frequent unfortunately).

&amp;#x200B;

So, I had to drop my hours in order to get some peace of mind (and to study for school). Recently, however, they have been implementing mandatory meetings (which I'm not sure is paid (I'll have to wait another 2-3 weeks to check), more difficult software (requires more time to use, but constantly rushing us), and also quizzes and tests.

&amp;#x200B;

I start a post-college in June of this year, paying triple what I make at this job. My current job however only pays minimum wage.

autism,cliner90,2019/01/08,"Toy sorting taking over entire rooms lately. My son is 4. And loves sorting his toys, but species, color, size, and so on. But it becomes vast. Like, hole kitchen table, counter, and into the living room. Or his whole bed, floor, and book shelf. 

We don't mind this, but his rotten 3 year old sister likes to make him meltdown by disturbing his set ups. It's hard to lurk over her all day obviously. And with baby three on the way, he needs a better solution. 

We've tried to get him to migrate to our room on our desk and bedside tables. Nope. 

I've debated a tv stand with levels. See of it peaks his attention. I've debated a card table. 

Basically just wondering if any other parents/or people themselves have had a situation like this?
My mom got me a shelf as a kid and I just rolled with it. My son is much more stubborn than me!

autism,Magrat323,2019/01/08,"In need of advice from adults on the spectrum. (Concerning school placement) I have a very bright 7 year old son who attends school in General education.  My child has a lot of anxiety and sensory issues especially when it comes to noises.  At the school Christmas party we went to a couple of weeks ago, I was shocked to learn that they kept headphones on him the entire day.  He has never needed that before, and I was honestly surprised that no one had notified me, because they have been really awesome so far.  My question is, should I keep him in general education with headphones on, even though he seems to have a lot of anxiety and meltdowns? Or should I move him to a smaller classroom where it might not be as noisy and less stressful for him?   My heart wants him to be where he is most comfortable, but I also want him to be around his peers so he can learn how to interact with them.  I thought I would ask the adult autistics on here because you can give me more of a window into what it's like for my child.  Or at least something similar, (I know that everyone is different.)  I really can only guess as to what he's thinking because he is verbally delayed.  Also thank you for all you do for the parents of this sub.  I truly would be lost without you.

autism,Wildnpc,2019/01/08,Is anyone else fed up with having to apologize for meltdowns? I try so hard to look normal and not embarrass my family. I’m pushing my boundaries harder then I have in my entire life. Maybe I’m pushing too hard. But all I keep hearing is try harder and do better and work on your self improvement because you should have more control then this. I’m so tired of trying to hide it and beg forgiveness. Why can’t I just be who I am- a person who gets overwhelmed sometimes and crying hysterically becomes the only way I can communicate. ,3.1081730769230766,5.495576548076925,4.577538461538462,80.76746153846155,76.78846153846155,6.8523076923076935,25.784615384615392,7.908726449838941,1.7720530769230771,427,16,76,7,10,142,77,104,0.115,0.768,0.117,-0.1988,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,2,0,3,6,4,0,2,2,0,11,3,0,1,1,15,19,10,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,2,4,6,1,2,1,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,1,4,11,2,9,16,2,8,0,1,1,0,9,3,0,0,2,52,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332613613767657,0.19527670540624334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11617875817700606,0.21048599797480935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16855681582795773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21375711974686654,0.0,0.0,0.2093485131658181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15920919037160094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17966643892418688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09957272022088312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34145318936957736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21480298197118924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16940057526001934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13461571878676865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600432775077802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19146810239160908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867326921221405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449483697032259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16641134348885347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19882156794515204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884932940480904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21904925374080408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3881838170547241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15127738627095394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17197318733972736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13874804371386826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Hububalli,2019/01/08,"Anyone else like heat over cold or am I the rarity? Noticed people here often complain about the heat in the summer and talk about their love of the rain and cold. Personally I hate the cold and rain. I cant get enough heat and sun, the hotter the better. I have never been too hot,  I wish everyday was 30 degrees C or above. I was in Croatia a couple of years ago in the middle of the heatwave that hit Europe. It was over 40 degrees C in the shade or a few days and I was loving it, I felt really happy and energetic. 

The cold is painful to me. I hate the feeling of it on my face especially. I cant stand having to wear so many clothes as within minutes I am over heating, covered in sweat. Which I know is a bit of a contradiction of my first paragraph but it isn't a nice warm feeling, it is like a boiling from the inside kind of feeling.  When I come back indoors I have to strip down as quick as possible to go back to normal temperature. It feels like I am covered in mild wasp stings all over. That biting feeling on your face from cold weather is terrible. 

The dark is just depressing, after reading about it more, I think I might have that SAD. This time of year is my hibernation period, I find it really hard to function. I will not be going outside until spring now as much as possible.  I used to go to a spa for a sauna, steam and swim several times a week in the winter which really improved my mood, but can't currently afford such luxuries!

autism,ArmenianPepsi,2019/01/08,Outlook for relationships for someone on the spectrum? Im an 18 year old male. And I've been struggling with autism for as long as I can remember. Diagnosed at 3 years old if my mom remembered right. It's mainly the social aspect that I've always been bad with. I don't work well with people. I have a few good friends but nothing romantic.  I want to improve myself but I don't know where to start. Is there any support groups for adults on the spectrum? I'm just afraid of being alone. I hope there is a second half for me no out there.,1.3082424242424224,3.635645672727275,2.6813636363636384,92.1653787878788,83.18181818181819,5.484848484848484,21.89393939393939,6.816661863887847,0.5422121212121214,424,14,89,5,12,137,79,110,0.134,0.728,0.139,0.5473,0,1,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,6,8,0,2,6,0,9,1,0,0,0,14,15,6,0,3,4,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,2,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,2,2,0,9,5,17,12,2,12,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,2,6,58,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18701558532231424,0.0,0.0,0.15024832144522465,0.0,0.0,0.1227934784095794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15076802254292648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832742809712077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13950757779141554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15145316212147925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793462951345677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1950460878436597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923629624914257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597983596879614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21148086152744608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17326134251150127,0.0,0.3789547119090197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251841824115428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19386410845867705,0.4091001751724708,0.15420539956050586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840679051967254,0.15299598429512476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12780804898252596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18877048785349185,0.0,0.0,0.20490817283821575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10650459240764497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1623537009536717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314567748537563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23256172562572625

autism,owsleybearstanley,2019/01/08,"How do you push your limits, build resistance to stress and overwhelm? As a parent, my ability to take space is diminished. I have a low threshold for overwhelm when there is noise and stress. My best coping skills have been plenty of time to myself to relax and recharge and not be bombarded with stress. But currently that takes too much time, putting too much on my partners shoulders, and depriving my children of much of my time and attention.
Admittedly I have a lots of unresolved and suppressed emotion, and this impacts my stress/distress tolerance, and I am trying to work more vigorous exercise and movement into my life. Hopefully this allows me to spend more time in triggering environments.

Under the reccomendation of my academic advisor and Adult Education Services on my campus( I am registered for being narcoleptic) I am being tested for a math learning disability-dyscalculia-. During the preliminary interview today, the psychiatrist asked if I had ever been screen for autism spectrum disorder, as many of my behaviors having to do with foods, anxiety, irritability,fixations and stemming and indicative of ASD. Autism runs in my family, and my younger brother is ""low functioning"" non verbal autistic. I have always struggled with feeling akward and out of place a lot of the time. I am very gifted in my chosen field of study, but I have difficulty in my every day life. I would just love to be comforted with stories of others being diagnosed in adulthood.

autism,JustAnotherWeeb456,2019/01/09,"Breaking down, don't know what to do. I'm pretty sure I am having a meltdown right now. Life has been very hard to deal with the past few months. For context I am in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents kicked me, I then had to live on a friends sofa for a month, I got into some housing so as not to inconvenience him more than possible, and it's so bad here. It is shared with 13 people, and they treat the place really badly. They consistantly break the  locks on things like the bathroom, the landlord has taken the plugs away from the baths so we can only use the half working showers, the place looks like it has been abandoned for the past twenty years, there's mold and cracks everywhere, the entire place is filled with garbage, the first  week I was here someone climbed outside my window, several of the tenants sound like they are violent, they scream and place music very loudly at all times of the night consistantly, the landlord is very confusing he had a go at me for not folding my clothes. I have trouble working the radiator in my room because it is so old and the drawers I have are so stiff they may aswell be broke. I am out of range of one of the autism services although they do their best to help regardless but they can not do much  until I move closer in three months which I plan to do, and the autism service that is actually in range can't help until I go through adult social care which is trying their best to not provide any support. To top it all off today I got ran over by a bike on the first time in weeks I go outside the house to try to walk anywhere, I was left vulnerable in the middle of the road for a good few seconds.

autism,crispietofu,2019/01/09,Shoe suggestion Hi all. My son is currently 2 and has been briefly walking on tippie toes. His reflexes and motor fuctions are fine from what our doctor says but suggest we get him high shoes to have him stop tippy toeing.  I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what shoes to get to attempt to eliminate tippy toeing. He currently does it mainly at home without shoes but when outside he doesn't really do it,5.245358649789028,7.034463177215192,5.975379746835443,75.67336497890295,69.12658227848101,9.317299578059073,30.888185654008442,9.725611199111238,3.266466666666666,337,14,56,8,6,110,61,79,0.036000000000000004,0.946,0.018000000000000002,-0.34,2,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,8,7,0,1,10,12,6,0,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,4,3,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,1,7,1,9,10,2,9,0,0,0,0,13,4,0,2,4,37,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21693921443727532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22306072609455044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3265224728609744,0.2791696990363768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333413833119102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370538717244188,0.3199952163520953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2043673643515372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536912811445577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667084578556382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3075163471157943,0.3459550893299944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,TeHPotatORisinG,2019/01/09,"What seemingly little things make you happy? Backstory:
I watching one of my favourite bands on Twitch earlier, asked in the chat about one of their songs that hasn't been played live since 2005 and they did it there and then! (Not the whole song but a good chunk of it)

And afterwards did two more songs from the same album that have barely been played before

I could've cried I was so (and still am) overjoyed hehe! Music is always my escape from the outside world and to hear these rare songs that I didn't think I'd ever hear in person

So with mine out the way, what are your happy places/things that may only seem minor to others, but to you: mean the world? :)

autism,manofmuchpower,2019/01/09,"Biggest fear I read the article today about a 9 year old ASD student was dragged out of the classroom by his aide..

[Teachers aide drags 9 year old ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna956626)

This would upset me with ANY child, but the fact the boy had limited speech (as does my own son) I feel anger, sad and fear.

You hope all the professionals who are there to help shape, teach, and care for your children are equipped individuals... but not everyone is.

We all have hard frustrating days and Ive been there in the face of a full body meltdown, the desire to finish the struggle, but this isn’t the answer.

As we enter making IEPs and getting services for our son things like this just make me want to vomit.

Has any person had issues with their own teachers/aides making bad choices?  

How do you encourage your kids to report?

autism,LeCiel7,2019/01/09,"Hi! I'm new. Tell me about yourselves while staying within the community rules. Hello! I just joined this community out of curiosity of becoming familiar with all kinds of people whether they're on the autism spectrum or not.

I am familiar with autism to an extent, though I do not have first-hand experience interacting with people whom I know have autism. I've definitely seen videos of autism throughout the spectrum. Even though I remember reading fairly extensively about it, it's been some time since I have read much about it at all, and I only know so much about it.

Most of my reading would be from government or medical websites, though almost three years ago I did read ""The Reason I Jump"", which, as short as it is, was quite interesting. I might read its sequel ""Fall 7 Times, Get Up 8"". One fact to know about me is that I do like Japan, so learning about those books' author was also particularly interesting. I also tend to like J-pop and J-rock, as well as J-idols.

Now, go on and introduce yourselves and say what you like! 😊",5.258607686729512,6.630747279187823,5.770953589557652,78.75046954314722,68.59390862944163,9.080348078317623,28.28462654097172,9.424239791934726,2.384950978970268,822,28,157,17,14,265,125,197,0.0,0.898,0.102,0.9529,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,1,0,1,17,7,0,0,5,0,15,1,0,1,3,28,23,19,0,1,6,0,0,3,0,2,1,1,0,0,12,8,0,0,6,7,0,3,2,0,1,2,5,2,16,7,28,15,7,18,0,0,1,0,7,7,0,6,10,105,28,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10919445444968323,0.0,0.12335015854233256,0.0,0.0,0.19701908516238156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360461415922838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08136132700299024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12049678464162115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047795478951428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643581260712665,0.0,0.0700078385586167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827632347935225,0.20309475858781426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.180543234983616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12409409185320287,0.0,0.13067788490350654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18110761827337016,0.0,0.0,0.11897108047992395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0834721091129894,0.09368635737269224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17079941020810288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13102047224054644,0.6160825633321125,0.0,0.0,0.1266528226497651,0.0,0.0,0.13954252703783832,0.0,0.0,0.09796020699779223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018983974084815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129687722408226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10766752669627963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3630805395206281,0.0,0.14365820288355244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11075647032157697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08750579503288455,0.0,0.0,0.07932592762252627
autism,booboothechicken,2019/01/09,"Tips for dealing with really picky eaters. My nine year old refuses to eat anything but 12-15 non-vegetable/fruit foods.  PB&amp;J, scrambled eggs, plain hamburgers, kraft mac&amp;cheese, hot dogs, cheese pizza, cereal, lunchables, and a few other things.  He will not eat with the family if it's not one of these known food items.


Last night we made sweet potato tater tots as a side dish to try and introduce a new food in a manner we thought would be a compromise.  He only had to eat three tater tots.  The meltdown started, but we stayed firm through his crying and said if he didn't eat them, he'd have to go to bed.  We sat at the table for about two hours, and he never gave in, so we sent him to bed.


I do give him a vitamin gummy with breakfast, and he has a children's nutrition shake daily when he comes home from school.


How have you had success in getting your super picky eater to eat healthier, or at least eat what the family is eating?",5.9209287469287455,6.0864882378378375,5.7669287469287465,83.67157248157251,66.62162162162161,9.105651105651106,28.710073710073708,8.841846274778883,1.9962432432432424,744,22,149,11,11,232,132,185,0.033,0.875,0.092,0.9186,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,5,2,1,2,4,4,0,1,11,0,12,15,0,2,1,28,23,14,0,3,7,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,3,1,5,14,14,1,2,0,0,4,4,1,0,4,9,3,14,3,22,10,3,20,0,0,0,0,25,6,0,3,9,86,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22424298411068375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08515594847168073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913961673505127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11366888942638392,0.0,0.1066842451712684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7412074318502443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951051313512752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753884786128442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05406448965657069,0.09926829097775193,0.05881056977078512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10379976163014752,0.0,0.10190782380847573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08435072997015743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979161122989822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798108353377275,0.09994248034685374,0.0,0.09710979745990947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10858577795448053,0.0,0.07012132352570451,0.07870187353697804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06629250257706913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843401535141492,0.0,0.0,0.10472817683041404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07324430065903934,0.1102968512905574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06874809965773848,0.0,0.0,0.08215226111914921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07025672599030364,0.0,0.1010857850311696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735098493266661,0.0,0.0,0.06663829504135763
autism,NoUndershirt,2019/01/09,"Anyone have family members that are in denial of autism diagnosis? Hi all! This is kind of a specific question. I'm a mom to a 3 year old. (He turned 3 on 12/23) He was diagnosed with mild-moderate autism in June. We've been doing speech therapy since he was 15 months old. He was virtually nonverbal until we started ABA therapy in October. Now he has maybe 20 words. You can definitely tell that he acts different than other children his age. He tends to want to play alone. And doesn't really engage in pretend play. But no stimming or repetitive play which is why I suppose people think the diagnosis is incorrect. (My family only thinks of autism based on the classic symptoms) 
So I guess I'm wondering if any parents out there had other family members that deny the diagnosis. Or if anyone with autism has gone through this with family members. I feel very alone. And the entire family acts like I am saying something bad about my sweet boy when I mention the autism. Any input would be great. Thanks. ♥️",2.71263683960019,5.511238895287956,4.352977153736319,79.31719538315089,81.5130890052356,8.08005711565921,24.91218467396478,8.841846274778883,2.4964952879581155,803,31,141,22,22,268,127,191,0.09,0.79,0.12,0.7891,2,2,1,0,0,0,24.0,1,1,0,0,5,10,0,0,8,0,18,2,0,0,1,22,31,10,0,4,5,2,1,1,0,1,2,2,0,2,8,7,0,0,5,4,0,3,2,1,0,0,6,4,10,9,20,23,1,21,0,0,0,0,19,7,0,7,12,77,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2557137068616737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16790031423549956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17263806408639126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10307549997560553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252990377213324,0.0,0.12897885799180506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5818878382435501,0.0,0.062419972627434414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13610393733754106,0.13599396949658754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12855406137250106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0603113795826074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12402200528976985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14458301680654373,0.09853652282180217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2590797819014464,0.0,0.0,0.09388920268979913,0.0,0.0,0.13707649131588426,0.0,0.0,0.08558460854942454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13829212739528032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07908515936851314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817230585412064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10211902305040696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503775499904576,0.0,0.0,0.08737846612022583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12831170175098025,0.0,0.0,0.10790064338698348,0.11365607085583215,0.2823514113872306,0.0,0.0,0.1582034070861326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13427802861741098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10185908631902564,0.07281394241932461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11139432251917984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338761375174774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08769525848562104,0.0,0.0,0.07949768040910732
autism,PsychyHex,2019/01/09,"How many others on here have heard the dreaded ""hmmm you don't act/look autistic"" not just from regular people, but from professionals? I was diagnosed with mild autism by a psychologist about a year ago now and anytime I have gone to any other professional, mainly just doctors, when I tell them I'm diagnosed with it, I get this look...then those words with a snarky tone. I hate it so much. It makes me feel so invalidated. I'm sorry you can't understand autism and how it actually works but please don't just judge me like that in a minute especially when someone tested me fully for a few hours to come to that conclusion.

autism,stare_at_the_sun,2019/01/09,"Autistic 5 year old I babysit has been flaring up. The little boy I watch is mostly non-verbal (he’s gotten better with his words over time). Over the years watching him and his twin sister has gone mostly without incident. Recently he has gotten weepy before school. The aids say he usually snaps out of it once some time passes. This alone has raised concern. On top of that, he has been throwing massive tantrums and nothing can calm him down it seems. At least for a long time. He has been attacking me when I try to calm him down, or himself. I can hardly get him ready for school or even get his diaper changed in the morning, as he is just running around the house, hitting me, or self-harming. He has an iPad that generally distracts him enough to be complacent. As of late, that doesn’t work so much anymore. I am well-versed in his ways and the tips and tricks that usually work (though have no formal background and do not claim to). Any advice or leads on resources is appreciated!

Is it useful at all (and if so, to whom)?",3.7944117647058815,5.024254323529416,6.19929411764706,74.83982352941179,71.94117647058823,10.734117647058824,28.30588235294117,10.793553405168565,3.3186258823529418,266,10,53,9,5,95,50,68,0.046,0.875,0.079,0.4663,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,2,0,6,1,0,2,3,11,11,7,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,10,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,5,8,3,5,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,1,2,35,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34822479562398595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28660410490939403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36248891209492995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37372094068517736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2641241577984661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32335424173176736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5926318329997666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,UsedAmbition,2019/01/09,"I work in ABA and I feel like I’m causing more harm than good... I work in ABA as an RBT at a clinic while I attend graduate school. My masters is in Developmental and Clinical Psychology and I plan on continuing into my doctorate for clinical psychology. Coming from a psych background, I’m focused on giving people the tools that they need to be successful in life while also fully appreciating the neuro diversity of everyone. Being someone that falls into the neuro-atypical spectrum myself (I’m bipolar schizoaffective) i love that we are all different and that we can live successful lives no matter who we are!

That brings me to the point of my post. I’ve always been a big believer that a person should do everything in their power to do no harm. I’ve been through the ABA training, i work with children with autism every day, and never once have I heard the opinion of a person with autism. Everyday I am told to block children from stemming and scripting behaviors when I am guilty of the same things in my own way. I feel often like I’m dog training, not giving an equal human being the tools that they need to be successful. I feel as if I’m just changing their appearance.  I want to help where help is needed, but I don’t see how forcing a child to fold their hands and repeat tasks repeatedly is helping. Every day I am being told to work kids until they go into a tantrum where they cry and are restrained. Am I imagining this, or am I doing more harm than good? Perhaps it’s good that I wish to continue with clinical psych and not ABA. I would love to hear from any and all of you and really even make friends.",7.166174609084138,6.703700066455699,7.6790320178704405,73.11540953090099,64.15822784810125,10.853015636634405,33.778108711839174,10.328600350310266,3.383206105733432,1295,48,239,27,17,429,165,316,0.076,0.7659999999999999,0.159,0.9722,2,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,3,1,7,10,8,15,1,0,17,0,26,10,1,3,3,52,53,22,0,8,6,0,4,2,1,2,7,2,0,7,12,22,0,2,4,0,0,6,6,4,0,0,5,7,36,11,41,41,7,36,0,0,1,2,31,16,0,5,14,168,48,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09327598167004156,0.09705279979590398,0.0,0.0,0.07931836283889708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13141195110314996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198201457004252,0.12338835217217635,0.10047397185085524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281222111431137,0.15044471382976635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12186268862357537,0.0,0.1193847227880004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703880707725687,0.0,0.19654638745089112,0.11145334251230064,0.10482740493699323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17692819908528987,0.08332676009457213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09011482382741842,0.0,0.0,0.22378107150777654,0.06628850053557753,0.2934931974036977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13146037005041752,0.0,0.23454152526932565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823854121759126,0.11396762205788065,0.0,0.20598834042920766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105420863525288,0.0,0.07785728422368725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25945850853791186,0.08995900943741546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12421648262855035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08086263644303453,0.20368894877414725,0.0,0.0,0.1102613379719887,0.0,0.11170769905710276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07472178232096995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11804466157989205,0.09294599786098508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09882765072211028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07748961553584173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2229066850246013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06879656814037605,0.09258242598376464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341288283980174,0.0,0.0,0.33965765285033284,0.0,0.0,0.08285683518205908,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,a_w_s,2019/01/10,"Functional Autism I kind of disdain the fact that ASD is referred to as a disability. While it often reduces social skills it comes with other virtues like analytical thinking and dedication to a special interest. The people at WIRED UK even speculate that it played an integral role in human evolution and we may not be where we are today without it. I consider it more of a difference than a disability. I think categorizing people into labels which are often used as a basis on which to ostracize or reject someone is born of the myopic paradigm of the 20th century, that deviants and outliers should be looked down on for their differences rather than accepted as fellow human beings. Despite my efforts to break free from that social construct I'm hindered by a lack of confidence caused by the subconscious message that people with autism should be treated differently, whether that be making fun of us or walking on eggshells and looking on us with pity for the ""horrible condition"" with which we're afflicted.",11.623477653631284,10.173821368715084,10.86921089385475,56.98806215083802,55.98324022346369,14.089664804469276,46.397346368715105,12.815532586354998,6.275932402234638,831,43,120,23,8,269,116,179,0.085,0.7859999999999999,0.129,0.818,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,4,0,1,2,5,11,0,0,13,0,12,0,0,3,1,33,20,11,0,4,6,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,0,2,15,12,0,0,5,1,1,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,9,10,33,12,2,15,0,2,2,0,12,9,0,5,4,98,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17156844825862885,0.0,0.14386698780964022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5234793931909839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11031057013556887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17391843150962805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159415912030173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28049786284947265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11148253377429873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3473575409761129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3404976235286381,0.1415096483176623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21403048745517872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15830888002832916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017923645354909,0.14424568549149233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16099465790400333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,BelmontOTD,2019/01/10,"Survey for doctoral research regarding Child Passenger Safety for children with ASD We are a group of doctoral occupational therapy students researching the perspectives of caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Specifically, we are looking into safety for all vehicle occupants while transporting children with ASD. We are reaching out to parents and caregivers in hopes of gaining a better understanding of experiences of transporting a child with ASD. Our goal is to gain insight into the lived experiences and identify gap areas in related knowledge, legislation, and confidence of parents and caregivers.

Due to the limited clinical and political knowledge on this topic, we hope that you will complete this survey to give insight into child passenger safety. If you know of anyone who this study might pertain to and who might like to contribute, feel free to share this post with them as well. Thank you in advance for your contribution!

autism,mjh10896,2019/01/10,"Getting a diagnosis as an adult? Hi everyone, 

For some background, I am a 22 year old female who has struggled with anxiety and OCD my whole life. I was recently officially diagnosed with severe OCD which has given me a lot of relief, but has not given me all of the answers I was looking for. I saw an AskReddit that was talking about autism in females and a lot of what the girls in the post were saying sounded a lot like me. I recently read this article (https://the-art-of-autism.com/females-and-aspergers-a-checklist/) and feel like everything is spot on. Even the physical symptoms such as pacing, closed fists and sensitivity to sounds and lights. I have always been super sensitive to sound, sometimes to the point of tears. Even my family members have always “joked” to me saying “your so autistic” (offensive, I know, just trying to explain that others have noticed my sensitivity to light and sound). 

I thought being diagnosed with OCD was the answer I was looking for as to why I never fit in, why I was always bullied but I’m now starting to think it sounds more like what was discussed in that article.

My question is, have any females in this forum been diagnosed as adults? I feel like all of the symptoms of autism I had very strongly as a kid/teen, but now I have kind of taught myself how to “act normal”. Would this make it impossible for me to get a clear diagnosis? 

Any advice would help!",6.7098741130693496,7.934950525291831,6.605493247882809,74.63066605630581,65.14785992217898,9.315541313801788,32.238269626916924,9.478462496947786,3.0113865415426866,1123,44,192,21,17,355,138,257,0.058,0.8140000000000001,0.128,0.967,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,0,1,0,2,9,11,1,1,16,0,25,6,0,2,4,37,42,16,0,3,5,0,2,4,0,2,6,7,0,3,13,10,0,0,9,2,0,1,2,2,0,0,16,14,25,9,36,23,8,19,0,0,3,0,13,9,0,5,12,142,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11230527200994422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868852527479083,0.0,0.0,0.15630851535411794,0.0,0.08791879167869092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3499452633671151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15181631501089335,0.0,0.0,0.1098176126928867,0.10328891978901936,0.0,0.10834288728119107,0.0,0.11622102429366454,0.16420765247141653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008916153478034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703310282681153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11967871869312592,0.06316083857566987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811762938817172,0.2245899835135106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1930193627587232,0.0,0.0,0.2931203141751916,0.0,0.0,0.07671462238338203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08863873827331392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11260399624684095,0.0,0.13084507867548598,0.1205964868251614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10864310244505188,0.0,0.11006823620846136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12874447088883673,0.0,0.11495803713244394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22695296935802875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18278902510479653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298347253347472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11366567864647226,0.0,0.08134587701852465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12014658710388805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23890618304769756,0.0,0.09237391801990268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736405402163569,0.0,0.0912391499360612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780278457259883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09482675854627756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074073684868584,0.12831182006940506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16328159622449148,0.0,0.0,0.07400917893110424
autism,jmnnrs,2019/01/10,"How much sleep do you folks get? I'm a 26 year old male who was diagnosed a couple of years ago. I understand that it's common for our energy levels and sleep needs to work differently from NTs. My NT peers don't understand this, and it has been making me question how many of us with Asperger's and autism require more sleep than NTs. I typically thrive with about 8.5-9 hours of sleep. If things are busy with school and work, I do better with closer to 10 hours of sleep. I get criticized for this even by my 28 year old best friend who is used to getting 6 hours of sleep.

Anyway, how much sleep do you all feel that you need? Does it vary by how much you have to do during the day? If so, by how much?

autism,username_815,2019/01/10,"Worth pursuing second opinion? Hi all

I was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and have been so far unsuccessful in medication treatment. I have a big problem controlling my emotions and as a result I'm almost paralysed to try new things or move forward. My thinking is very rigid and my vision of the world is very narrow. I crave high amounts of structure and routine of which my efforts are always thrown off course by my high levels of impulsivity and lack of focus. I have been very depressed and anxious for years and have given up on maintaining relationships as they seem  overwhelming to navigate. I've had mentioned to me traits of ASD by one therapist, a psychiatrist and a psychologist, bit when I went for an assessment, I was basically given books to describe and I had to put toys in order. Those things aren't a challenge to me at all, I am able to imagine and interact with things. Is it worth pursuing a second opinion? Happy to give more information if needed.

autism,Jurgi_Goblinlust,2019/01/10,"New job, bright lights I just started a new job and the atmosphere is a lot different than anywhere else I have worked. It's a very corporate office with a jacket and tie dress code, and it's full of florescent lights. They give me a huge headache all day long, and I don't feel comfortable relying on solutions I've used in the past (namely wearing sunglasses). Plus the office is much bigger than any of my previous work environments, there are a lot more people, and a lot of casual small talk in the cubicle. I started less than a month ago and I'm already feeling like I want to crawl out of my skin. I'm so overstimulated but I don't feel like I can explain what's happening to any of my new co-workers or bosses. Plus I'm convinced that everyone hates me and I'm about to be fired, but that's probably just my anxiety disorder.

autism,oh-lawd-hes-coming,2019/01/10,"A little insight into my life right now. It's great. Hey, I just felt like sharing my situation right now. 

I'm an 18 year old guy with autism, depression, and anxiety. I had not left my house for about 10-ish months, but this week I made a significant change. I thought this change was going to be tough and exhausting, but it turned out to be amazing.

After about a year of staying at home and basically bedridden, I suddenly started a new course that goes on from 9AM to 4PM. ***HUGE***  change, obviously. But the course is one specifically for people over the age of 18 that have some sort of disability that causes them to find difficulty in working or attending college. Perfect for me.

Despite that, I expected to hate it. I expected to immediately be taking days off and giving up, as I had done with every other form of education or work before. I have extreme difficulties under any sort of pressure. I usually get overwhelmed and quit asap. But this has just turned out to be the opposite.

The past few days since I've started have just been amazing. I wake up at 6AM every morning, (something I haven't done in years, literally.) I head into town, go to a coffee shop, and just watch the world go by until my classes start. 

Every morning, I start the day off being the most content and relaxed person in the village. It's just amazing.

The course itself is also incredible. I can't believe I'm actually being productive, I'm actually working for the first time.

The course is an extremely comfortable environment for people with Autism. Everyone there is like you. For the first time in my life, I feel like I actually relate to others. Sometimes I just don't want to leave.

I just want everyone here to know that if you're in a bad place, take a chance. I was originally very anxious and terrified about leaving my house, It was my comfort-zone but also my prison. If an opportunity comes to you like this, grab it and run with it. You never know how good things can turn out for you.

autism,RagazzaMatta,2019/01/10,"Suppressing Stimming Can Have Devastating Consequences A few years ago I was going through an incredibly stressful time. I had some negative people in my life as well, making things worse. As a result my stimming became much more obvious. I would constantly be told to stop, and, not wanting to cause more trouble, I managed to suppress my stims. This had consequences I never could have imagined:

1. Stimming can burn as many as 500-800 calories a day. Because of my disability this was the closest thing to exercise I was capable of. 

2. My stress and anxiety increased to the point that I couldn't rationally think. 

3. In order to soothe my stress and anxiety I turned to food. I began to binge before bed because it was the only way I could get to sleep without stimming. 

I gained almost 70 lbs in 6 months. My pain and mobility problems became even worse. By the time I realized the problem I was too addicted to my foods of choice to quit. I HAD to have the same snacks at the same time every day. 

It's been a long and difficult process as I try to get healthy again. I've distanced myself from negative people and try to spend more time with people who truly care about me. I've opened up to my family about the extent of my problem. My cousin who is also on the spectrum and has also  had eating disorder issues holds me accountable and keeps me going. I also joined an autism support group where I'm developing healthy friendships. Most importantly, though, I've taught myself to be comfortable stimming again.

autism,2sentimental,2019/01/10,"Hello! There are a few questions I would like to ask people on the Autism Spectrum: I mean no disrespect by any of these, I am just trying to be better informed, 

1. I have heard various arguments about saying someone is ""Autistic"" vs saying they ""have Autism."" Is it true that saying Autistic is a slur? Or is it a personal preference/decision?
2. ABA therapy is controversial, why is this? What has been your experience with behavior therapy?
3. Kinda going along with the last question, is it true that most people in the community believe Autism should not be treated, through ABA or otherwise? I understand the view that Autism is not a 'disease' and I agree with that, but would it not be considered a disorder like any other? I for example, have an anxiety disorder, and it is treated.

autism,DIY_Creative,2019/01/10,"Pittsburgh Zoo now ""Sensory Inclusive"" Certified New to Reddit and this subreddit so not sure if this is the place for something like this, but thought it was topical. 

Does anyone else have similar places in their city that offer a program for sensory sensitive guests such as this? The Pittsburgh Children's Museum also has a similar program and sensory bag of items.

autism,Shithousecity,2019/01/10,"My gf might be on the spectrum This girl is the sweetest thing and I care a lot about her.  Shes somewhat shy but shes got a lot of energy once she warms up to you and she has an incredibly genuine personality.  Shes sort of a dork but the fact that it seems to be so genuinely who she is is why I like her so much.

-The big giveaway to me is that she has a very difficult time making eye contact and has for the past 3 months weve been dating.  It has not improved much.  I asked her about if it makes her nervous and she said yes, and I told her thats okay and It doesnt matter to me, I want her to feel comfortable around me.  I made sure to change subject quick to not make her self-concious about it.

-she dresses very plain, no make up, pretty much the same clothes whenever we are together.  I like this because to me it seems authentic.

-she is very blunt and the conversation doesnt really flow in a way that im used to.  It stays pretty baseline and any attempt to go a bit deep with anything she doesnt really seem to care much for.

-She is very un-opinionated about politics, philosophy, anything morally related.  If you ask her about her opinion she will tell you, and she has moral codes, but shes totally uninterested in talking about them in casual convo to the point where its a bit odd.

-her job is directly related to autism (dont want to give any more detail than that) which is suspect considering she seems to have some signs of autism, perhaps why she is interested in it.

-all that being said she does sometimes make breif eye contact, we have good conversation most of the time and laugh together a lot.  Its a really cute relationship and I think there is this comfort and honesty between us that feels very mutual to me.

Does this sound like someone who is high functioning autistic, or could it qualify as someone who just has a few quirks? (the eye contact is pretty severe).  Obviously you cant tell without knowing her but am i totally out of the ballpark?

It wouldnt affect how i feel about her regardless, and i wouldnt ask her about it.  I figure if she feels its time to tell me she will.  But i just felt like making this post ",2.796922701184517,4.755275716937355,4.055694834534133,86.1868002808646,76.05336426914153,7.599487116864086,25.49523751373794,8.452757503120043,1.6679893271461723,1698,61,352,33,38,556,205,431,0.053,0.772,0.175,0.9957,1,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,4,4,1,1,17,19,0,1,22,2,42,3,3,10,6,79,74,26,0,9,14,0,6,4,1,5,0,3,0,2,31,18,0,0,13,1,0,2,11,3,0,0,8,12,62,16,46,57,18,26,2,0,3,0,65,14,0,17,11,247,93,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778918722032513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304365352779111,0.07055175780523955,0.22227189315066567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048311746107143366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17304697243577974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16160693883206548,0.0,0.08383891016578036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06327687896776782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13870924642983035,0.0,0.09288364295483403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16029030431447608,0.0,0.07609507684600814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07602646773644657,0.04504116915080885,0.06647345387745293,0.0633856710111686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373489084690887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560657923968418,0.0,0.07864613411031664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043555243543846094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15487557876103744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20213358402855475,0.0,0.07499087653523978,0.3174109910474968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08407465277306897,0.0,0.0,0.06325879588040349,0.0,0.2330395863406347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440160148724808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07565572581749544,0.0,0.06920045197705778,0.0,0.0,0.074919473728711,0.0,0.07590223535043157,0.2418856424425616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15231403982184238,0.0,0.0,0.08508780332882715,0.0,0.0,0.150775044449198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28859493998689445,0.0826779117104682,0.08953305893221039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343012105263287,0.0,0.07838300484393368,0.0,0.0,0.084472895861102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469478715863109,0.0,0.0,0.06370036540341267,0.20781121293650376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052652011322955834,0.05078196769001335,0.0,0.0,0.1386387627985744,0.0,0.0,0.07572940724198918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09533131058353657,0.06844893759901169,0.0,0.3269591297468617,0.09349066090106356,0.06290715094526694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430265755007439,0.0,0.0,0.07639683124730491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

After  watching this, I can relate to him, I sound creepy too because it is  hard to fake those expressions, specially 24/7, and specially when did  not get any therapy, or in other word training.

autism,greenjelloplease,2019/01/11,"How to help special education teacher understand I’m a classroom aide in a special education class specifically for students with autism. The classroom teacher doesn’t seem very familiar with autism and is often getting upset at them for things they can’t control or is trying to “fix” things that there isn’t a “fix” for. 

We have a couple of students who are very much in their own head, they do the animation thing were they will have stories going on their head. 

The teacher doesn’t seem understand that this isn’t something that the students can just turn off when it’s time for them to do their work. She gets so upset at them and is always telling them stuff like “we leave our movies at home” or “it’s time to turn our movies off”. 

We do have some students who can do a better job of controlling it, but a few of them just can’t. 

How can we get her to understand that these students aren’t doing this on purpose?

I wonder if this is an area that can be researched, ie, can you develop a profile of a person based on the different kinds of YT videos they watch. I am an aspie who just now watched a series of videos on how asphalt is laid down on pavement and am now watching a video on how rice grass is sewn in a field by machines. I seriously doubt my YT video history is similar to NTs. I tried looking this up but the search results get swamped by Google info on how to 'get more YT views' and similar things, not actual analytics of people and what their video choices say about them.",8.741228070175438,6.693301330827067,8.492593984962408,73.65613408521305,62.007518796992464,11.874185463659149,40.21177944862156,10.504223727775694,4.069612531328321,539,24,104,10,6,174,89,133,0.028,0.957,0.015,-0.1556,2,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,4,0,7,3,0,1,11,0,11,0,0,4,0,16,16,9,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,6,3,0,0,3,5,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,7,10,1,18,14,1,12,0,0,6,0,10,10,0,4,2,70,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.2788627634052703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2985607610167993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298597993611376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915404325567124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2975774401538962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2399683439841851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19811158400444653,0.4990332007573675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22724963457532354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18984776100536788,0.0,0.0,0.22686333022505936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1940138300728348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3098970026680445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's hard to say if we made the right decision.,3.743333333333332,5.382762105263161,3.7894736842105283,90.45464912280704,72.6842105263158,6.64561403508772,27.14035087719298,7.1686216300943375,1.2162877192982453,304,11,62,3,6,93,56,76,0.058,0.84,0.102,0.5187,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,3,2,0,3,1,3,0,0,6,0,4,0,0,1,0,9,6,3,0,2,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,3,0,0,1,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,1,3,6,3,12,4,2,16,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,2,4,36,7,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116909787664454,0.17222327053656505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4357791753511058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581027054523822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14712960785514845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16174642519017995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15541084620397289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5236934489748825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15862706430788226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14026275850363115,0.0,0.2612255010607293,0.0,0.498668529636357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187826363741607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317459533959056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,LilPeaHen,2019/01/12,"So I went on a date last night..... We went for dinner sitting in these booths. He's sitting across from me looking at my face and I just couldn't make eye contact no matter how hard I tried. I know it must have been strange and the thought of it all was making me a bit anxious but I couldn't stim because that would be weirder. In an attempt to calm myself I started unconsciously arranging all the items on the table at right angles. I didn't even realise what I was doing until he asked ""so.... What's happening here?"" 

""Oh... It's... Just an aspie thing"" I said. My panic was peaking but then he started handing me objects from his pockets so I had more items to arrange. He didn't laugh at me. He didn't make fun of me. He didn't make a big deal of it at all and I have to say, it was pretty great.",-0.1880357142857143,2.025240553571429,1.7180952380952412,96.99357142857143,89.89285714285714,3.9142857142857146,20.5,5.288315135182226,-0.2566857142857142,615,21,138,3,21,202,99,168,0.116,0.8,0.084,-0.3376,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,1,0,0,1,8,5,0,1,8,0,18,4,3,5,4,23,32,11,0,4,4,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,10,4,1,0,2,0,0,2,7,1,0,0,14,6,21,4,19,13,7,22,0,0,2,0,13,11,0,0,7,97,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2067713510441906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1711079691085991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157314552875323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1998209192860514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886954811153212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12088932481051633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2017907804914126,0.0,0.0,0.16185247108830134,0.0,0.16395857119915794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10058828169200223,0.14919355288679462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15369876707640984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4886947178163472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17176088112440407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21474580003164734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862069038428556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15630627860674454,0.17410306325015276,0.1455524844355879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25909858629313004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12159673361193425,0.0,0.0,0.14530505804023067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12426508423099356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.339340546362224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001897668340706,0.0,0.0,0.0

He’s very sweet and considerate to what I need in someone. My question is, I know he is being considerate and has asked me what I find okay socially for certain actions. But I want to make sure he’s not uncomfortable as well. I figured this would be a good sub. So what things should I do or don’t do when dating someone on the spectrum?

autism,scrumperumper,2019/01/13,"Am I a slow eater? So, I’m completely fine with all textures, flavors, combinations, etc. of food and have no aversions besides meats. 

Today my boyfriend and I wanted to try the best ramen place in town which is so popular you have to sign up on a waitlist before it opens to be seated. So once we’re seated, we fill out the paper they give you with our order and we decide ahead of time we want dessert. My boyfriend is generally a food inhaler, and I usually take a little longer to finish up. The food comes and it’s great! We dug in and we’re off in our own little hand-pulled noodle heavens for a while. He finishes first, as usual, but then I realize my bowl is still almost completely full. I started to panic because the waiter said our ice cream would be out in a few minutes and my bowl was still full! I started looking around and saw the older couple next to us  that was seated after us had finished their bowls already and were leaving!!! 

I started panicking because it’s such a busy spot and I knew people were most likely waiting for our seats, and I felt like I was eating so slowly. I’m surprised I remained as calm as I did, but I was so worried about it that I couldn’t finish my food.

So I was wondering, does anyone else eat at a snails pace? Or are there any food related rituals or quirks that you have? I’ve always been one of the last people to finish eating regardless of my company, but today was a shock for me because it really put it into perspective for me. I would love to hear what everyone else’s experiences are.",4.143115622241837,5.250518029126216,5.27737128567226,82.24294130626656,70.97411003236245,7.948278905560459,27.637687555163282,8.296473431620573,1.8660213592233013,1217,42,236,18,22,403,176,309,0.061,0.846,0.093,0.8320000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,10,3,2,3,12,12,0,1,15,0,25,10,0,0,1,45,44,27,0,6,5,0,1,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,11,23,9,1,5,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,15,8,39,10,37,24,8,48,2,0,3,1,20,20,0,5,26,166,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105626375949276,0.0,0.100346826145822,0.0,0.07566354007870446,0.0,0.0,0.061837557888684426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635824675513054,0.09317160395738737,0.0,0.08094964847470874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662957374656169,0.0,0.07737728504670376,0.0,0.0954285728600443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07833072731534585,0.1906830398161363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061563437876814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07957608065332024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791414798248702,0.15192570563723606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014143315007113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0868903778749198,0.0,0.08894992219027248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08730993972318636,0.0,0.0,0.07734756292563831,0.5497827197482008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08723121902969913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10025395297573048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024880992510108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07412253126218214,0.0,0.09628491678696154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885054070964604,0.18227750891986227,0.0,0.0,0.07636081752288919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207058231441636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967082765857419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09684067674055577,0.061618553828976665,0.0,0.0,0.10669028230962506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126082984648434,0.0,0.09500563038015232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09141278036531564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058254007955302174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08649810597642361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1930885352372314,0.0,0.14523842173495413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06837029887619013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05302376327505982,0.0,0.17238770202799678,0.0,0.0,0.06173753766490525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21876240423870652,0.0,0.2002997040742662,0.0,0.10726927820141782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09861295902089652,0.0,0.09234687498996036,0.0,0.12919238770599434,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Balvenie2,2019/01/13,"Pooping is like Armageddon for him First of all, I’m interested in gaining understanding about what he may be experiencing from anyone who has experienced something similar or has a child in a similar situation. I want to help and I don’t know how. And, somehow it is escalating to where I’m worried it is causing trauma of some sort for him. 

My 8yr old son (ASD and Apraxic), resists pooping at all costs. We use bribes and treats and sit and help him and celebrate successes.... but, he dreads it. This leads to a pattern of him holding it and then having accidents. He appears to be embarrassed by the accidents as he checks his pants and then gets upset.  Often, when I try to invite him to sit on the toilet to try, he dysregulates into screaming and hitting and running through the house. 

He wants to be left alone, but he also demonstrates an inability to manage this. Has been true always and many docs have examined and found no physical reason.

autism,whitedragon2112,2019/01/13,"23 yr-old autistic adult desperate for OT recommendations, help with tactile sensitivity  Hello! I am a 23-year-old transgender adult on the autism spectrum. I've been struggling with severe tactile sensitivity in my chest since I started puberty (I'm FtM) and have not been able to find adequate help.

  
I was diagnosed officially about six months ago. All my life I thought my sensitivity was just because I was trans. I grew up in a home with strict gender roles. My touch sensitivity was written off as part of my “perversion,” and thus something my parents believed I could just make stop by choosing to be “straight.”

  
My sensitivity has a vast negative impact on my life daily. About once a month it gets so awful I can't work or leave the house. I want to be able to get top surgery but I'm not sure I'll be able to tolerate the process because it would cause me so much agony. It hurts to bathe and be hugged. I've frequently considered suicide because I couldn't imagine a future where I could exist without being in intense physical and psychological pain every second.

&amp;#x200B;

At my autism assessment, it was recommended that I pursue occupational therapy. The trouble is, I can't find anyone in my state (Washington State) who works with adults. And I need someone who really knows their stuff, and also isn't a bigot. I'm even prepared to travel to another state if that means I can get the care I need.

autism,kndlytrtrd,2019/01/13,"How do you cope with the aftermath of ABA? If ABA programs were implemented on you because of you being autistic, and suffer from ABA sessions (e. g. single event, multiple and repeatedly occurring events, multiple different repeatedly occurring events over long periods of time, i. e. years), how do you cope with that and possibly be re-traumatized anytime in everyday life?

&amp;#x200B;

For instance:

How do you gain security in your environment especially if you're living in an ABA promoting environment?

How to figure out who to trust? How to recognize ulterior motives of other people who are friendly towards you or spend time with you? Will it going to be groomed/paired towards something anyway?

How to re-establish self-esteem and so on? How to not feeling awkward setting boundaries again without being afraid of the whole spectrum of possible consequences?

How can one obtain the certainty that (minor) disagreements or supposed mistakes do not end in punishment or how to withstand anxieties that will turn into flight or fight responses somehow in order to prevent being punished or leading to uncontrollable selfharming behaviours (ranging from hitting or biting to immediate suicide attempts)? 

How to stop intrusive memories or dissociations?

&amp;#x200B;

Did you receive specific therapies you find helpful? Or were you refused because of autism and/or speech impairment and/or because of considered as having a mental disability? Or ironically because of PTSD? Or because of low or no income, living too far away from a willing specialist and a moving would otherwise be impossible, or other obstacles that prevents from receiving proper help (e. g. no trust in professionals)?",10.44801711229946,12.068757014545458,9.942096256684492,52.59479144385032,57.03636363636364,13.306951871657756,47.81283422459893,12.627914446148155,7.278033155080212,1389,87,165,47,17,448,167,275,0.125,0.7709999999999999,0.103,-0.7755,2,0,1,0,1,1,50.0,0,11,0,6,15,13,3,3,7,0,20,1,0,12,0,49,24,31,1,4,17,0,1,0,1,4,1,2,0,0,9,10,0,5,4,0,1,5,5,9,0,1,3,3,12,4,45,10,2,38,0,2,0,0,20,16,0,15,15,134,21,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2860033593588152,0.320743442781562,0.0,0.0,0.10096533061818802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240007726748662,0.0,0.0,0.4022728668783063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378923641160912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689625462615327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06673370913398467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206285140112387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196842232696192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07500801234409349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769285620730157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09322229290957433,0.0,0.0,0.2330838057403456,0.11679929424464912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330061045982388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14027523122511726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943394225051393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09149921303831217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2975781626299144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15427907288694695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376852763612444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1016056501131134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11034227365375722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14436611700322094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15093211489814098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15391871077690225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14355775127175804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14735240428320032,0.0,0.12722526011837704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937557263464243,0.0,0.320743442781562,0.08499162780658039

autism,wolfmeetsthesky,2019/01/13,"Things to buy for overstimulation Hello, 
Ever since I was little, I’ve gotten overstimulated pretty quickly with loud things and strobe lights or crowds of people. I bought some earplugs, but they’re utter trash and don’t do much to block out sound, but I need some better noise cancelling ones that aren’t too bulky so I don’t get myself hurt in public. Are there any brands or tips for the other things I said earlier anyone would recommend?

autism,shaza124,2019/01/13,"7 year old rubbing his private area Hi. Our son is 7 and has mild autism. The above is leading to sore patches on his penis, and the behaviour is drawing negative attention in public We have ruled out infection etc. There was a query as a baby that his foreskin was very tight... we havent checked this again with Paediatrician. The behaviour is mostly seen as response to excitement and we have a program in place with includes distraction and re direction. This works when we are around but it's hard to implement all the time with others kids and other demands.

Any ideas on how to reduce this further?

autism,vike8706,2019/01/13,"When did you know your child may have autism? Hello everyone,

This is the first time on this subreddit and I'm looking for some help. Currently my wife and I have a 2yr old son and seems to be showing some signs of autism. He rarely says a word, it takes us a solid half hour for him to say please for anything, he babbles a little. He always seems to be in his own little world even when you call his name. When hes watching his favorite show he likes to spin in circles every once in awhile.

I did some research and some of the things I've been seeing in him looks like signs of autism, but it seems like it can change on the day. For example, today when he woke from his nap he was looking at me dead in the eyes with no problem, and he also understands when we tell him to get down or no.

It's been stressful for me because my wife doesnt want to believe he may have autism so I'm super stressed out. When I told her I thought he may have autism she cried off and on for a solid 5 hours, and she wouldn't talk to me the next day.

My sons 2.5yr check up is coming up and we are definitely talking about speech therapy and possibly testing for autism. I'm just looking for help and reassurance that I'm doing the right thing and/or this is autism.

Long winded, but thank you all!",4.226570477247503,4.600201641509436,4.515826859045506,90.45067702552721,70.32075471698113,7.5937846836847935,25.776914539400664,7.285733465282438,0.9212397336293008,1005,27,226,9,17,315,150,265,0.096,0.7809999999999999,0.122,0.5394,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,3,4,0,2,11,9,0,2,11,0,23,1,1,0,1,40,45,21,1,3,4,4,0,3,0,4,0,3,0,1,10,15,0,0,6,3,1,1,4,3,0,2,8,10,28,6,35,31,6,36,0,0,7,0,44,18,0,11,20,139,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09325076351338246,0.0970265605361756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09595781863215604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108268800416542,0.0,0.0,0.13137642248034198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11906902416657306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12335499281493052,0.1004468076407667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12808757193659698,0.15040403949652467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07701797881395776,0.0,0.09824662451919987,0.11142320991223216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09918605432317484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060922467379135224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15631874297734316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296692750116796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408428668478358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17090521454327418,0.2337421661106493,0.0,0.10319373335227593,0.3916828356838536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401311705393793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12235967743877285,0.1241828993774016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279997272777258,0.0,0.13145713663975506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157737552007607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09958194135910664,0.0,0.18546150671533645,0.0,0.0,0.09292086891896882,0.31846454120868617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671463868995945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767412859465384,0.187448956602817,0.10191986285745476,0.10735627509651144,0.13335053537626473,0.0,0.15493733078333372,0.0,0.0,0.09257311924973098,0.06799461632262985,0.0,0.11053002403213767,0.11142320991223216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12139224376647192,0.14026414595343642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06877796825429701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Kakorie,2019/01/14,"Seeking input in a kiddo who pretends to sleep in class Basically when he doesn’t want to do something either in school or at home he puts his head in has hands, says he is tired and fake sleeps including snoring. Occasionally he will say his thumbs hurt and he can’t work. He receives various sensory breaks that include puzzles, two recesses a day , swing time, go noodle and whatever the OT has up her sleeve. Is there anything I can do to curb this behavior? His parents are at a loss and what I have been doing (visual schedule, reminding of breaks after activity) are not working.

autism,_ToxicSupportMain_,2019/01/14,"Didn’t get a diagnosis. Confused. So around 6 months ago I started to suspect I may have autism. So around november I decided to go to a psychologist. 3 days ago was the final session between me and the psychologist. We went over everything and she told me that she would not give me a diagnosis but that it was very close and if other psychologists had done the same, some would definitely have said I do have autism and given me the diagnosis. 

I did this out of curiosity but knowing that some psychologists would have given me a diagnosis and some wouldn’t, it’s left me a bit confused. Has anyone been in this situation?

autism,diegrauedame,2019/01/14,"Feeling like I may be on the spectrum, who to talk to? Hey everyone—Apologies if this isn’t allowed, I am on mobile and couldn’t find a rules section. 

For context I am a 27yo female. For a long time I have suspected that I am autistic, in part due to behavioral and social stuff, and in part from watching home videos of my interactions with folks as a child. I’m not gonna get super into that, but I’m wondering what type of doctor I should speak with about my suspicions. 

I’m worried that I will be seen negatively or as a “diagnosis shopper” if I outright tell someone I am suspicious that I am on the spectrum, but if I am I would like the diagnosis so I can find community and also to potentially get accommodations that I need during grad school (planning to apply for this Fall). 

Anyway, I’m not sure where to start with this...any insight would be greatly appreciated.

autism,Quirky_Aardvark,2019/01/14,"For those who had low verbal ability in childhood: What did you think about all day? I work with an autistic child and, unlike some research articles I have read, I am skeptical that he is ONLY thinking about numbers and calendars (ha). His lips move, he laughs to himself...he is clearly engaged in a fantasy world that is very real to him. 

What did YOU spend your time thinking about as a kid?

I have ADHD, and when I was little I would also engage in daydreaming and thinking about tasks or concepts that were more interesting to me. But my inattention wasn't always daydreaming. Sometimes my brain was on a different ""mode"" than it should have been, and I had to ""switch back"" when I realized I didn't know WTF was going on in class.

autism,Mittens27,2019/01/14,"Autism and Abuse I'm trying to do research on whether there is a connection between autism and violence in a relationship. So far, what little research papers I can find, tell me there is no connection at all, that autism won't cause a person to act out violently against their spouse.

I am doing this research because my sister is having a very hard time in her relationship. He fiancee is very abusive. He insults her and her family with very deep personal remarks, he chokes her and hits her. I have seen her covered in bruises from one of this attacks. He is very controlling and often will do things to ensure she cannot leave the house and is isolated from friends and family. He blames all of these things on her and she always eventually accepts that as true and forgives him.

Him, his mother, and her all agree that the root cause of all of this behaviour is his autism and that anyone who refuses to accept that he has no control over it is ignorant and unsupportive. 

One example of this is, the family cat died and he texted messages insulting the cat and all of us and saying we deserve our cat's death. We have never ever been unkind to him and these insult come out of nowhere. In the end my sister to let us that his Tourette's caused him to send this message and we should apologize to him for being upset about it.

We have tried many times to be supportive and accepting. I try to keep myself educated about mental illnesses and also about the cycle of abuse, but I'm having trouble accepting that this is actually autism. I know many very good people with autism and they do not behave the way this person does.

Can anyone with autism or extensive experience with autism please help me in understanding what may be happening here? Is this autism or is this just an abusive spouse?",7.465603715170275,7.448687529411767,7.318947368421052,74.4618421052632,63.411764705882355,10.687306501547988,33.18885448916409,10.307518312809881,3.3074117647058827,1440,52,260,30,19,459,175,340,0.139,0.769,0.092,-0.9478,0,0,0,0,2,0,25.0,7,0,2,2,11,18,5,1,12,0,35,1,0,6,8,65,45,27,2,1,6,5,1,0,2,4,1,1,0,3,25,31,0,5,8,0,0,3,6,9,0,2,2,3,37,9,42,34,5,23,0,0,1,0,59,14,0,4,5,194,62,4,0.0,0.4308497810007795,0.08871419030288376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07269999286240797,0.07564367295964998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12713154516470132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10342225154202198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05541735762626737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2801661343433936,0.0,0.07831015986788596,0.0,0.0,0.20392462333131528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09434931703141597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07955518621107521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08051849976931785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223250644863629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08892656644069741,0.257103091534082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308929151451204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702361629623528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625025926428508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.080390637285421,0.0,0.0814367178856133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06093446890160064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10489692231280268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08080420559304892,0.0,0.0,0.049961276551989495,0.0,0.0,0.09625963507395988,0.0,0.09296073760512133,0.0,0.0,0.09111482398452052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18433516405309555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09161501398535933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011472006957095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232047490571368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06302493940015247,0.2381350191694845,0.0,0.0997909176169414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1952047527427251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07229458347824375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316259552080384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07945858053174236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12079196370818365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601968145017833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18516398136805734,0.0,0.0,0.09463960318252716,0.2187049633798049,0.0,0.0,0.3750477364691209,0.0,0.07215943040957444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,ShirosRevenge,2019/01/14,"Looking for help connecting with my son and his thoughts My boy is 14 and is getting along quite well in the world, but I’m having trouble getting to know the “real” him (him from HIS perspective). He may laugh at something and his mom or I will ask “what are you laughing at?” in an inquisitively nurturing way, but his response is always one of two statements: “Oh, nothing” or “I’m just feeling giggly today”. Similarly, if we find him gazing pensively into oblivion, we will ask him “what are you think about, bud?”. Similarly, we always get one of two responses: “Oh, nothing” or “I’m not thinking about anything”. When asked how he feels, he usually responds that he feels “fine”.

I want to empower my son to conquer his slice of the world on his terms, but I find that effort somewhat hindered by this communication barrier. I imagine that we’re not asking the right questions the right way, or we simply haven’t explained well enough what we mean to him. 

Does anyone have any advice they could offer? Thanks and blessings to all!",5.800396634615384,6.970887765625005,6.026250000000001,78.1629807692308,67.17708333333334,8.407692307692308,32.99839743589744,8.617729084823388,2.7156133012820516,809,35,144,12,13,258,118,192,0.025,0.799,0.17600000000000002,0.9847,1,0,1,0,0,0,26.0,5,2,1,3,7,9,0,0,6,0,12,0,0,1,1,45,34,14,0,3,11,3,3,0,1,3,0,0,0,1,7,12,0,1,14,0,0,0,3,1,2,4,1,4,26,8,21,29,4,16,1,0,1,0,37,10,0,8,4,98,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12432116031664316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2117199953367302,0.0,0.0,0.08651622336338362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08895750661056483,0.0,0.10469395596965507,0.0,0.4757465382476764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10157747239197858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11133398865101517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13145570319194316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19298380656739472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23255962757610266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1994068083749629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08527511268903297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06991861199182342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10683555060362054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385834972236637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14900242007935474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24414842226336606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17241963455261014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14251923991453605,0.13531766588074645,0.0,0.1448079960610591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21729604804770736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09794273080298392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11713014424708798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16303913862977448,0.0,0.10100110870441532,0.0,0.0,0.12059283583451268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2485574036141649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14011851800893887,0.0,0.07503961305853117,0.20196790652888605,0.0,0.0,0.2287780953436053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am from a poor family and it's up to me to get out of poverty but that's not possible with my low social skills.

autism,Opioidofthemasses,2019/01/14,"My boyfriend supports my autism I just wanted to make a nice lighthearted post here. 
My boyfriend of almost a year loves everything about my autism. He loves my happy hand flaps, he loves when I bounce up and down, he makes a shushing noise to calm me down, and he wants to do deep pressure with me. He even wants to make me a sensory bin so I can have a fun sensory experience! It really is amazing because I’ve never had someone support my autism so fully before.

My wife’s boyfriend, Tyrone, loves everything about my autism. He loves my happy hand flaps, he loves when I watch my wife bounce bounce up and down on him, he makes a shushing noise to calm me down, and he wants to do deep pressure with my wife as I watch. He even wants to make me a sensory bin so I can have a fun sensory experience! It really is amazing because I’ve never had someone support my autism so fully before. Basically growing up I was told to just stop acting weird but he makes me proud to be autistic.

autism,quielywhis,2019/01/15,"I am very isolated, sorry for breaking any rules for this subreddit So I am studying physics and I live pretty far away from my family for almost 3 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not diagnosed with anything and I think in uni I am doing fine (though the test phase will be hard), but in the last 3 years (which I think is a long time) I basically just completely isolated myself and usually I act quite strange (obsessing over noises and light) and so on and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think there is something very wrong with me

autism,talisaa,2019/01/15,"My mother casually told me she believes I have autism Please let me know if I am invading this space. I have never been placed anywhere on the spectrum by a medical professional before.

I was talking to my mother this past week about a friend who worries he has autism. At one point, my mother told me she thinks I have autism in some way/shape/form. I had no idea to react, but I was upset and explained to her I felt she was coming from a place of complete ignorance. She has always believed I lack empathy, and I've always seen her as over empathetic.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but any insight or advice on how to handle this.

autism,LonelyEyess,2019/01/15,"Noise Cancelling Headphones. Hi!

I was hoping to get some recommendations for good noise canceling headphones. I’ve noticed frequently one of my boys walks around with his fingers in his ears when he’s playing. Even when he has one of his favorite videos on his iPad. It seems like the world is just a little too loud, and I get it. I want to help him as best I can. 

If anyone has any experience with using these headphones to just quiet things a little I would really appreciate the input.

autism,AutoriiNovici,2019/01/16,"So I have an interview... over the phone for a job, and I am trying to keep my cool. The last job I had that was worth any salt was a Director of IT/Infrastructure.  I was damned good at it, I lost the job because my wife was having a panic attack and my son which was a year and a half at the time was the only person home with her.  

I booked it home to make sure my son was safe and so was my wife.  Needless to say I lost the job because ""I wasn't there for work."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, almost a year later I have an interview for a VP for Information &amp; Technology for a very, very large company. The salary is between $150k to $280k a year... I just got a request for a 30 minute phone interview, my problem is that I can research the hell out of the company, and already have.  I know full well what the company does, the potential pitfalls, etc... 

My issue is that it is a phone interview, I will not be able to tell how people are reacting beyond the basic audible hints... and I'm not great at that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what do people here to do prepare for such a thing?

I have, and it's really making my mind bend on what's real or not.
When I woke up, I felt very very anxious still and I didn't trust anyone or anything. I kicked a nurse into her stomach because I believed she wanted to do me harm. 
I believe I had  psychotic episodes but they feel more like memories than dreams. 
I can perfectly picture it all in my head. 

I'm still having issues with it to the point I almost can't leave my home.

autism,ikomusshi,2019/01/16,"I think I’m on the spectrum but don’t know what to do. Sorry for the long post, I’m just desperate at this point.
I’ve been a socially awkward person all my life. Couldn’t look people in the eye to save my life. Been suspected of having dyslexia when I was little my parents never pursued it but I’ve been diagnosed with OCD’ used various antidepressants and they never worked. I always thought I had ADHD because I just couldn’t focus on anything, I constantly zoned out, couldn’t stay still and so on. I took the online aspie test (I know it’s not diagnostic) just to see what it was but I scored very high and suddenly things started to make sense. Up until couple of months ago I could act like I was a normal person but I’m just tired of faking and I’m avoiding people because I don’t want to put on a smile and force myself to seem like enjoy social situations anymore. I booked a psychiatrists appointment but I don’t want to seem like I’m just making up a diagnosis. I’m just thinking would telling my symptoms be enough for him to come to a conclusion or should I just stop trying, because I know I’m never going to feel normal.",3.196414187643022,4.942093986956522,4.676270022883298,83.09685354691076,74.34782608695653,7.276887871853546,25.148741418764306,8.032893268588372,1.5163043478260865,907,30,176,14,19,303,126,230,0.099,0.792,0.11,0.5267,1,1,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,2,10,8,0,2,10,0,19,6,1,3,4,53,46,14,0,10,14,1,1,3,0,2,5,0,0,2,7,8,0,2,11,1,0,5,10,3,0,0,9,4,23,5,26,30,3,32,0,0,3,0,8,12,0,3,16,113,30,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14312207595152704,0.0,0.10556539043553917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09909175449951313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810448625199033,0.0,0.0,0.09800026460446563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2177870130596267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10258480098640213,0.0,0.1286931180679259,0.0,0.09508303588367596,0.13176993477046914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12087303126840301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12305097822753495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060215077788136964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06768113681445298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12582427833028742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19634492972913406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682324477984049,0.17454290318674698,0.11935866433081035,0.0,0.10539019454801132,0.10000493468174262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15898593158603624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09505586332281647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2755467981430033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333642620848327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322344634269044,0.0,0.0,0.1651229132069765,0.2079681920422407,0.0,0.0,0.11257778710232806,0.0,0.11405453437664854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11971753873339082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09489867392925756,0.21682867014189275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13386125052645867,0.0,0.24279288444021785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333106095078197,0.0842919487620055,0.1269332419579436,0.09510478901387964,0.09956390372429096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12377927731848595,0.0,0.0,0.10408920993473186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911757285814387,0.15261510159414696,0.0,0.09454352246700866,0.0,0.13687551675745116,0.0,0.0,0.1323124831435341,0.08085374963068981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10285483254067512,0.0,0.0982610620920547,0.14048379139831638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08669835600030394,0.0,0.0,0.08459755089738001,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,LittlePickling,2019/01/16,"I need to have a rage My husband has autism and has recently went for a PIP assessment (Basically a benefit from the government relating to disabilities). He has received this benefit for 3 years already for depression, anxiety and autism. 

His claim has been denied as they feel he doesn't require any assistance. Some of their reasons why are as follows:

• At the assessment he appeared to look well and dressed smart.

- we advised them prior to the assessment that I am the one who picks clothes for my husband to wear on a daily basis. I can't believe they have said no because I didn't allow him to look scruffy?

• At the assessment he showed no signs of low mood or anxiety

- Depression is not a 24/7 thing. Someone is allowed to have a good day and still be depressed. When we showed up for the appointment we were told that there was a 1 hour delay. He tried to wait in the reception but became so anxious that we had to go and wait.in the car.

• That he has a driving licence 

- Just because someone can drive doesn't mean that they do! My husband passed his test many years ago before his mental health became unmanageable. I took time off work and rescheduled the assessment in order for.me to drive him to the appointment and attend with him for support.

• That his depression medication is currently working and he is not currently seeking other treatment. 

- his tablets are work g currently but he continually meets with his doctor to keep a check on the medication, his extreme depression stems from being autistic and feel I g so different. They reason he isn't pursuing other  treatment is because autism is not something that can be cured.

• That he was friendly with the lady that conducted the assesment.

- he's not a fucking monster?

• He gained qualifications while at school without any help.

- he gained 1 qualification while at school which was barely a pass. He was kicked out of every school he attended for behavioural problems, however his autism was undiagnosed at the time. The lady at the assessment never asked for any of that follow up information.

I'm furious that under the write up of the decision, he states that ""he has decided that he has more good days than bad days"" from the 20 minute window that he was seen in.  Some jumped up cunt  who has never met my husband has made this decision on the most ridiculous of reasons. 

Rant over. We're appealing the decision.

Tldr; the government are cunts and have decided that my husband won't get any disability benefits for the weirdest fucking reasons.",5.65217149758454,7.716667284782607,5.96463768115942,75.05772946859905,68.54347826086956,9.458937198067632,34.08212560386474,9.861636050157227,3.7180314009661855,2021,98,339,50,36,646,225,460,0.142,0.7929999999999999,0.064,-0.9888,8,0,1,0,0,0,46.0,4,0,6,6,7,25,7,0,34,0,44,8,2,8,2,58,69,20,0,2,9,5,2,0,1,1,4,1,1,0,23,18,0,4,13,2,1,16,15,15,1,1,17,6,32,9,57,48,4,61,0,6,3,3,58,21,5,5,22,225,55,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098281636872058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10081515450256916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24850463904259104,0.0,0.13977631059751636,0.10320784981358758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540682975899355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07627960683755727,0.16707185577899689,0.0,0.07773841233041892,0.1029284969645025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1767538812957482,0.0,0.3934299419851277,0.0,0.0,0.09544903085893787,0.0,0.0935081624916086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697254349508725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09238608538321208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07058249491704552,0.16891687472909728,0.04773046700705835,0.0,0.05192051155835906,0.15325249301644134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09710863629167084,0.0,0.0,0.061234934542557774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08996862918617063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120264818003127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15343440170844086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08644457382717549,0.0,0.09262205700775747,0.0,0.09951498290146693,0.0,0.1840659235606488,0.09206676427373653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06774034904302975,0.1409209063875884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06190613358778164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08741668665276486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757224606658883,0.0902044037751065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690180101481787,0.0,0.0,0.2773756760120976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15481364460337604,0.07033138415789397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295813175815298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036712865120393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06069379223508209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10654246062779683,0.0,0.0,0.08729590368425796,0.1015014246761596,0.06202567273279672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214126754791379,0.08468921823006377,0.08243583710687863,0.0,0.0,0.08806526639032572,0.0,0.1995278096677856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11766233115608735
autism,ladychick84,2019/01/16,"Masking? Hi, I am a parent of a 7 year old high functioning ASD child. I have a question that I don't intend to be offensive, but I am curious about from your (autistic adult) perspective.

Why is masking so terrible? As a neurotypical here I can say that I have to mask in most situations in my life. This includes work, meetings with my kid's school, doctor appointments, and in some cases even at home. Sure I'd love be the authentic me in every scenario but if I was then I would probably be unemployed and divorced. Is masking in the autistic community a different concept? 

I can say that right now my child has zero filter. She is who she is around everyone and everywhere. While in some cases this is good, in other situations can be problematic (like school).

autism,SSTralala,2019/01/16,"Sudden behavior changes in Level-1 child? I'm mom to a sweet second grade boy who was diagnosed as level-1 back in Kindergarten. He has come so far in his ability to self-regulate when school gets overwhelming and we've never had to worry about him academically. He's a bright, empathetic, wonderful child. However, right before the winter holidays he suddenly began to cope less. He wouldn't do his writing or math work and I would recieve calls from the vice principal and emails from his teacher that he'd totally melted down and been utterly unreachable to calm for way longer than usual. I figured it was anxiety due to the holiday. He just needed a break from the school stress.

However, now that its past the holidays, the extreme emotions and work refusals have continued. His IEP has him doing social skills/OT twice a week, but his caseworker suggested it get increased to 5 days now. She leaned heavily into questioning what's different at home and if we were suddenly doing something wrong that would upset him lately. I feel absolutely helpless, nothing has changed at home. In fact, we've even been better about bedtime, more family togetherness, and less emphasis on technology. I'm at a loss as to why he suddenly feels unable to cope. Do you have any insights about what things made you or a loved one suddenly unable to deal? How did you get back on track? I don't want him to feel he's bad when it's just he needs more help.",5.337519545131485,7.330891074626868,5.898336886993604,75.50480099502487,69.22388059701493,10.030135039090263,31.41862117981521,10.290406445055957,3.6209173418621177,1160,50,200,33,21,375,165,268,0.092,0.784,0.125,0.7385,3,0,1,0,0,0,31.0,1,3,0,4,14,12,0,3,12,0,21,2,0,2,3,36,37,17,0,7,6,1,3,0,0,3,1,0,2,3,11,10,0,1,7,3,0,2,3,7,0,3,9,5,19,5,32,24,6,38,0,3,1,1,38,13,0,5,21,125,30,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08892290240875292,0.0,0.10003286276026607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20109639742496324,0.1091811253218756,0.0,0.0,0.11126915424519652,0.0,0.0,0.11564869878627075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13352301005402234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2766585190586579,0.11264021184678327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433091737514169,0.1348102719862892,0.0,0.1327210631372234,0.0,0.13661885570876112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14709007732458926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0863673187169998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232711342764866,0.0,0.1983521648394679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20495383953932955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876472669373547,0.0,0.2623306576337995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475056602080244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801815322189192,0.12373052562423527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15314731901476145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1939172957187588,0.10085200867343834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547003025657275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886079728207577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12482748774756415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14648379193645708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11167035801595043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2646770191881829,0.0,0.0,0.13641368051809824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13329577907872914,0.0,0.10066726856834307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14978786444906558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08687271488420513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14401628756071333,0.0,0.07712703963934772,0.10379309072782132,0.10488969374213916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11799270913059233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418062231215336,0.19039313997278293,0.13279554421065215,0.0,0.18577968594125402,0.14296813506858574,0.0,0.0
autism,ZiyodaM,2019/01/16,"What to do with restricted interests of kids? Hello everyone, 

My kid like all kids in the spectrum has restricted and repetitive interests. He is currently interested in garbage trucks. We are learning to draw now, and he is drawing a garbage truck all the time. He watches movies about garbage trucks and he builds LEGOS with garbage trucks.

autism,final_cut,2019/01/16,"Sick of not getting it. I make it a point to go out of my way to get jokes pretty often, and I've learned my best way to feel like I fit in has become to make witty jokes back at people. But I often make ""witty"" jokes that don't hit the mark and I always have to ask people on reddit posts what their jokes mean or how something works. I think half of my last 10 comments are asking what something means or if someone could explain a joke to me. I'm trying really hard to just 'get it' but I don't want to just nod and pretend I understand things I don't. I think if I asked more questions earlier in my life and didn't just pretend I got it I would be a lot better off now. This didn't really bug me much until last night when I didn't understand an apparently 'racist' joke on my hometown sub and I asked about it and got a bunch of downvotes.

autism,cub_scout_reject,2019/01/16,"Does anyone else have intrusive curious thoughts? So intrusive thoughts are usually thoughts of a harmful nature you can’t ignore even if you don’t want to do whatever it is you’re thinking, but for me, and this causes a lot of sleep issues, I have thoughts I can’t ignore but they’re more like burning questions.  I just get these questions about something stuck in my head (could be about nature could be about comics) and I am fixated on it until I just cave in and research it.  I sacrifice sleep because I can’t sleep with that going on and I end up lost in some research binge for days.   

I don’t mind it because I know a bunch of stuff about things that interest me and I never feel like I lack things to talk about (even if those things are unusual).   It just doesn’t seem like something most people deal with from conversations I’ve had (honestly how many people have a burning urge to research rabies at 3am)

Does anyone else struggle with this?

autism,VoidsIncision,2019/01/16,"Watching my Ndad interact with my probable autistic nephew :/ I’m non diagnosed but have been living a schizoid life since after college when I decided I had no functional model of the social world and could not stomach working around a bunch of ppl I find threatening and confusing on a very basic level.

My nephew He is a newborn infant but I see the signs.  Predominant flat affect, distant gaze, very mesmerized by and attentive to non social environmental stimuli like lights and shadows.  Finger rolling and arm flailing.  He does eye contact and looking at your face in little bursts then looks off to the side at the wall or the floor.  My dad works him up into overstimulation and then literally takes the crying as instance that the baby doesn’t like him and literally reprimands him for crying and asks him out loud WHY WHY, .. or with narcissistic bravado shouts HEYYYYY11 as if that’s going to make  him calm down and then proceeds abusive terms like fussbudget bad etc etc.  reminds me of how I myself never remember any warmth from him when I expressed any fearful emotions and was always told I’m too this and too that (sensitive stubborn lazy bla bla bla) I’m like he’s probably overwhelmed by your overdraftic bullshit just like I still am at age 36 which is why I’ve been confined severely depressed with PTSD to my bedroom for the better part of 15 years.  I just hope my sister stays in Alaska and does not move back here where he will develop ptsd and non existent self esteem the way I did somebody shoot me and put me out my misery ",8.012708333333332,8.075644854166669,7.573055555555558,72.82750000000001,62.26388888888889,10.394444444444446,36.75,9.978442167317967,3.693350000000001,1250,54,213,23,16,394,184,288,0.196,0.721,0.083,-0.9919,0,0,0,1,0,1,16.0,0,2,0,3,12,14,1,3,13,0,12,7,5,3,1,45,24,28,0,3,9,4,1,5,0,1,2,2,1,3,5,22,0,2,4,0,0,3,5,6,0,0,6,9,28,8,32,16,5,39,0,2,5,0,26,21,0,5,18,132,33,3,0.0,0.1335029411752013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937556732460314,0.0,0.0,0.153247439009949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003057586769187,0.10533709137141099,0.0,0.0,0.08664108757337713,0.09407996922373722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965299396302923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08996282373418267,0.0,0.2475391578347804,0.0,0.0,0.0970478962024048,0.11436403039885028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.197207505971092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674562482313825,0.0,0.0,0.2513276253465036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679211649738706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10298405882054734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403651424021338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11191294839625156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958657349862941,0.275239641637232,0.11293121197220485,0.09949520043927752,0.0,0.18923935753016144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752122773876688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975703076477792,0.0,0.0,0.0869028767030679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201740756138073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24296812783916144,0.0,0.2634250325837319,0.11327076102343152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12764023577577022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897883896529137,0.0,0.11754591122782665,0.1272920999027707,0.0,0.0932069652634635,0.0,0.0,0.2297185114443641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12009789933759699,0.08998340546046002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08471852353857437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10766699347917508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18593942708635652,0.0,0.08943716922244897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3050183924439004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16405931607906973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07255981613494357

autism,yourradicaldadical,2019/01/17,"advice? hey folks! i’m evan. i’ve been on this subreddit for a while in an effort to educate myself and have noticed that i’ve really resonated with a lot of the posts on here. it intrigued me but i never really looked into it.
i had a conversation with my mom about my childhood today. as a kid, i has a lot of pretty severe sensory issues. i am currently in my teens and i grew out of them to a degree, but they’re still here and i am still working on dealing with them. that topic came up and i asked about it, and she told me, pretty much straight up, that if she had known more about it when i was young, she would have had me tested for autism. she thinks i most likely would have tested on the spectrum. however, i was what people called “high-functioning” and it didn’t interfere with my development in any way, so she didn’t ever take me to a specialist.
this completely confirmed what i was beginning to notice as i found more and more information that seemed to match what i have experienced.
my question is whether or not i should bring it up again with my mom. i’m currently doing fine and not having major problems with my sensory issues. will it cause problems if i end up getting screened for autism? should i get screened so i can better understand what i’ve been dealing with since i was a little kid?",3.504278444202108,5.167563022900765,4.678767720828791,83.73960559796441,73.35114503816793,8.043911304980007,25.453289712831697,8.704169506293173,1.8001793529625596,1040,34,206,20,21,342,135,262,0.014,0.889,0.097,0.9667,3,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,2,3,12,5,0,0,11,0,27,0,0,1,2,46,42,20,0,8,8,2,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,2,17,18,0,1,7,0,0,3,5,2,0,0,14,4,37,3,36,23,8,34,0,0,3,0,20,15,0,8,15,162,54,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12376992105601235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08613261096081326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11840927025538554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201978467699716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12933322201331815,0.14486440196732367,0.0,0.1301139058536094,0.0,0.0,0.13279977934181927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26116018249475204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11218247190737883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11457051324822075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13887529400266024,0.0,0.0,0.13234842654159976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13382241694467456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643986311191977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06187929567317409,0.12694581010914727,0.0,0.0,0.10636184242897168,0.0,0.0,0.21536227401188304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2966834885293079,0.0,0.0,0.09310909816825223,0.0,0.09768739652419148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2884047163306571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08780955325767313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1213045181448784,0.25771591721193793,0.0,0.2423915301365605,0.0,0.0,0.14188731048083336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16228227554375405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153057942645996,0.0,0.1430888632155025,0.0,0.10477381324923464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2023004287843728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523196832866873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08115811204565304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005812794171727,0.12102830980503565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13185671188318615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10053619103642576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09220941855620972,0.0,0.0,0.17995014760140138,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,BostonFound,2019/01/17,"School Requires Service Dog Handler My five year old nephew has autism spectrum disorder. He is non-verbal, suffers from seizures, and is significantly impaired physically from contracting acute flaccid myelitis a few year ago. He started a new school this year (public)  and has 1x1 and inclusion. 

He is receiving a service dog in three months, which should be great. However, his school has told his mother that the school will allow the service dog but will require that he must provide and pay for a handler while the dog is in the school. Some quick math and it would cost over $20k/year for him attend his public school with his service animal. 

Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation or any advice? Thank you in advance!

autism,Mikejl1719,2019/01/17,"Should I confront kids? My wife and I take our autistic 10 year old daughter to many kid friendly attractions.  Sometimes my wife will walk with our daughter while i'm about 10 feet behind carrying things and i notice kids whispering in each other's ears talking about my daughter while staring. Granted,  i don't know what they say but it is obvious they're taking about her.  This just happened 20 minutes ago at a indoor water park we're staying at which motivated me to post this. 

Should i confront these kids while their parents are usually close by?
Should i ignore and accept ""kids will be kids'?

If i do confront,  what should i say?

I went to see a new doctor today. The entire visit was a flop but at one point, he said 

""You're so smart! Who told you you had autism spectrum disorder?"" 
to which, I replied ""Yeah, that's actually common in females with autism"" 

Totally took him off guard, which was a small win, but still. I'm very tired of the narrative of ""You can't be smart and have autism.""

autism,Grapecultmeme,2019/01/17,"Could I be on the spectrum? So recently I have been watching the show Atypical and I’ve noticed that I can relate a little to much to the main character. 
Socially I can manage however I don’t know how to make friends and I can’t sympathize with people if that’s normal?
Mostly my problems are filtering what I say and understanding and expressing my emotions for example I feel things but I don’t think I feel them as deeply as I’m supposed to.  Also there’s the problem that I self harm with no apparent reason and the problem that I can’t comprehend things sometimes i instantly forget something I just learned.

I tend to over share as well as having difficulty doing basic hygiene such as brushing my teeth or hair.

I’m not sure if I’m on the spectrum or not but any advice Is appreciated ",2.7378846153846155,5.2493774679487215,4.550961538461539,79.80028846153847,78.80769230769229,7.7461538461538435,28.98076923076923,8.660442795831766,2.6994307692307684,639,30,115,15,16,216,97,156,0.16,0.763,0.077,-0.9153,2,0,1,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,0,7,8,0,0,7,0,14,2,2,3,1,33,24,19,0,7,9,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,7,7,0,0,7,1,0,0,7,4,1,0,1,6,19,4,16,21,3,5,0,0,1,0,7,4,0,5,1,87,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17791169184803798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14559721732707848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238103604541546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14536399049748058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20479848272467407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1841149457219328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14066287327433266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005809565683836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1824768381270696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12152971996276668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13383863413843652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17838492461290412,0.0,0.20728207056106934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12622086244543287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226345001470208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18719301766351654,0.17976710276276045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14478529870248782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899333748485605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855922153653224,0.0,0.1401624381319667,0.18006681993752396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1715939930645036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419116302345462,0.11665982250001088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189535959080402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16369819062452734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,DrFoo1,2019/01/17,"Am I a shitty parent? Hi. I'm new here. I'll be flat out, I have not explored this sub much. My son is 3.5, and received his ASD diagnosis in December. I still break down at work crying almost every other day. Oh, he has an O-ring chromosome as well.

I'll get to the point; he does not sleep through the night, my wife and I are exhausted. We've tried to comfort him back to sleep, a walk in the night air, 3 kinds of melatonin (we've yet to see his Dr since the diagnosis, so we don't know how much is safe, so we have gone as high as 3mg in one night but usually 2mg), leave him in his room but that doesn't seem right with him wide awake.

I'm not at my point yet I guess......He has so much energy, running around, throwing himself against furniture, always wanting up to bounce in our arms, and yelling only what he can understand, etc etc... It gets too much, and I end up putting on tv and feeding him when he requests it.

Not to mention my mum helps run a club thing for autistic children.

My mum always says I have some ""autistic traits"" but she didn't think much of it, thinking it maybe related to my OCD or Tourette's or anxiety. However recently she has gotten more and more worried about it so I am getting a diagnosis soon.

Can I just ask one thing which is when is it normal to be diagnosed? Like at what age?

Has anyone else had this happen to themselves or people they know?,5.508461538461539,8.492039076923081,5.258307692307696,75.88669230769231,71.69230769230771,8.775384615384615,35.4,9.3871,4.075226153846153,240,13,36,6,5,74,44,52,0.049,0.951,0.0,-0.3535,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,4,9,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,5,4,1,11,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,2,5,22,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899120790880612,0.27829075688575705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5695439943266329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2756727015831663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22689058584590835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2401788328193389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14926664962011935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2606117024001609,0.0,0.28500308023590537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882962605445517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25177995678883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2758274049757069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17490429876017033
autism,PeeBurns,2019/01/17,"Things Go Full Circle At age 9, in febuary of 2007, i formally received my diagnosis of aspergers syndrome. at the time i struggled with sensory overload, my motor skills were severely impacted, i had trouble regulating the volume and pitch of my voice, and i very frequently felt misunderstood and picked on by my teachers, as i didnt quite understand why it was an issue for me to be constantly talking or yelling through-out class.

i struggled through-out my teens to deal with all this, especially with my sensory and social difficulties. i did always think myself pretty capable, but im sure it was a worry for my parent and teachers how fulfilling a life i'd be able to lead.

as i grew, however, i worked to overcome these difficulties and not let them own me. i still struggle (quietly! i try not to talk about it) with some of them, but i moved out, went to university and graduated with a degree in history. 

the title of this post relates to the job i got: i work in a primary school as 1 to 1 aid for children with behavioural difficulties, and one of these children is autistic. it means so much to me to be able to give back and relate and help a child who is underground many of the same difficulties i did.",8.688205228248144,7.17977963090129,9.079492781896217,67.69425282871636,61.7038626609442,12.936246586031995,40.92430745220445,11.911945987284742,4.8883167381974255,966,46,178,26,11,324,138,233,0.122,0.8320000000000001,0.046,-0.9263,3,0,0,0,1,0,27.0,0,0,2,5,5,5,0,3,11,0,13,1,0,3,2,33,21,18,0,0,5,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,0,3,10,17,0,0,4,0,0,6,3,4,0,1,10,4,28,1,39,7,6,21,0,0,0,0,14,8,0,2,6,127,38,7,0.2835746528078741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11797841391397612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902570199528293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15322172897213726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14617650766184914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361380685697723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13601532328782848,0.08058100508557665,0.0,0.11340027744399575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950370561399906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15315464334362053,0.14798913126182425,0.14070204331253605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14498714763329593,0.10014858178850347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14375009457273075,0.0,0.15444796483294934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15069748907460165,0.104229999165764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09607876185615684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15743804657277027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13579306505790226,0.14424868441676916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15080827457757098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14349634398486974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16017932067853793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14453432356976248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11323154202034025,0.0,0.0,0.4446806966593961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336328771516276,0.0,0.0,0.2279265643100345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09419719941050317,0.09085159363832968,0.0,0.0,0.08267733024961055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626428746373024,0.0,0.0,0.1476056071851314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11698939345332005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13143827208288705,0.1279410084717027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20644572460194696,0.1439919124838059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,RubiconOut,2019/01/17,"Aspie makes a completely new kind of nature calendar! I'm aspie and feel more at peace when surrounded by nature than anywhere/anytime else. It is my safe place. My calming place.

I've actually spent the last year and a half in national forests and on BLM land, trying to immerse myself in nature. Stress-wise, this was a huge gain for me, but I also got frustrated by not knowing as much as I wanted about nature, and having most of the information I found presented in individual topics, one by one.

Being an Aspie, I decided to make my own order out of the chaos. So I put lots of topics together to make a calendar, but I wanted something that could help me *experience* the world around me, not just pretty pictures of it (though there are great pictures, too).

To do that, it follows the moon cycles, includes seasonal produce, astronomical events that are visible with the naked eye, nature activity ideas, and more...And it doesn't start in January, but in spring, at the beginning of the natural year.

If you're interested you can [check out the calendar here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1081428080/a-moon-calendar-and-seasonal-companion-quickstarte?ref=6psqk7). If you know anyone else who might like it, would you tell them? I really appreciate any help spreading the word.",6.350665687714147,8.662080339207051,6.638465491923642,69.92987640724428,67.19383259911893,10.330788056779248,31.113313754282927,10.504223727775694,3.8281152227116975,1035,42,164,30,18,333,144,227,0.055,0.7859999999999999,0.158,0.9698,0,0,1,0,0,0,58.0,0,3,1,2,9,7,1,0,15,0,12,1,1,4,0,37,27,16,0,6,8,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,10,9,0,1,7,0,2,2,3,1,0,3,4,2,18,6,30,19,5,32,0,0,1,0,9,18,0,5,12,112,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.1478024075215057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12112193027039207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029975031184281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10590384910868698,0.1551879294202528,0.0,0.13483086906857236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15880217184068104,0.0,0.0,0.12092790950330365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530495846603285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14815623709895895,0.0,0.0,0.07658236203571145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1660672812254496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12113582105952544,0.16698438920955627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2030399234655052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1709790897040053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577215313430456,0.16647611688773445,0.1234595269522991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07399535295596135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12876526231871965,0.0,0.0,0.3033007334345433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16067435954359013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113399968021594,0.0,0.0,0.14628031494721375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052654537741505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31648541907048944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15408853679578802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15225840819408676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970286921232882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11660075219576907,0.0,0.0,0.1072036568565109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17349609175798475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13238208521924824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14880797209437302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283090803184423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17866921323042434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10759232584490748,0.0,0.0,0.19506961909219853
autism,KeyKindheartedness4,2019/01/17,"Anybody know anything about Microarray blood tests? My daughters paediatrician has now written to us to confirm the diagnosis and sent some blood test forms along with the letter. I don't fully understand the forms but he's written Microarray under tests required on the one form and ticked CK on the other. 

He did speak to us about this at the appointment before Christmas.

I'm just curious if anyone has had this test done? Is it to confirm the diagnosis or is there another reason?

autism,onlinethrowawayyy,2019/01/17,"I’m not sure if the guy I’m talking to may have ASD... We have not met in person yet, so I’m not sure what to think.

But when we talk through texts...he texts me a lot and I can tell he wants to talk to me a lot, but he never asks questions about me. He just answers whatever I ask with a very simple, hard to respond to answer. Sometimes it leaves me thinking he may not want to talk to me, but when I don’t answer he’ll text again.

This is leaving me feeling very confused. It’s very hard to have a conversation with him. 

Otherwise we seem to have a lot in common and would have a lot to talk about if he asked me questions. He also works with adults with ASD which leads me to believe he is a caring person. 

Is this something that would be common with someone who has ASD? (It would be a relief to know it was ASD and not that he just doesn’t care what I have to say. Hahaha)

Any info appreciated! Thank you!!

autism,UniKitty26,2019/01/18,"Supporting college students with autism Hi all. I have a new job that involves supporting college students. Some of them have autism and are more unique and struggle more than I'm used to. Some of the struggles include writing, planning and organizing assignments, time management, and of course social skills. Can any college students with autism share what kind of supports have been most helpful for you? Anything including apps/technology you use, tips/advice you've heard, or something helpful a teacher or staff member does. I'd also appreciate any insight or information that helps me understand the perspective and experience that college students with autism have. Thanks!

autism,greengleam,2019/01/18,"My son is getting started on PECS. Is it possible to start too soon? My son is 2.5 and autistic. He doesn't use language independently yet, but he does a lot of imitation and has a handful of words he will say when prompted, though not consistently. He also knows two signs (ASL). I know it's way to early to know if he'll talk, but he is showing progress.

His therapy center got him started on PECS and introduced the binder to me today and showed me what to do with him at home. I have conflicting feelings about using PECS and I'd really appreciate anyone who has any insight or perspective they are willing to offer. I'd rather not share my feelings yet, as I'm more interested in your opinions.

autism,Mezuthial,2019/01/18,"Can someone explain how neurotypical view the world? Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I've only recently (a week ago) learned that I am on the spectrum. Which explains a lot of things I've struggled with my 40 years of life. One thing I've always struggled with is trying to figure out how others think. I've always known I think differently then most (now I know why). And I can find tons of people explaining how someone that is on the spectrum tend to view things. But while that's nice in seeing some recognition, what I'd really like to have a more clear view on is how the ""rest of the world"" views things.

&amp;#x200B;

Because it's really a struggle to live in this strange world for me. People just don't make sense to me. Often they seem stupid, ignorant, foolish, emotional, rude, untrustworthy and so forth. And I'm sure they're not, or at least not as much as they seem to me. I'm just missing some dimension in which others tend to think or work. At least that's my guess.

So I'm autistic (as you may have known), and for some reason, I'm assuming as compensation for my motor skills, I talk more with one side of my mouth. It's distracting and I feel like it makes my facial movements uncomfortable to look at, especially for myself. It hurts my self esteem kinda badly if I'm being honest.

autism,everyoneisworthless,2019/01/19,"How to deal with highschool? For me highschool is a nightmare. I am enrolled in two community colleges to save money (since high students get a discount) and get out of highschool as soon as possible.

Although I won't be able to get out completely for some time and I am falling. Whilst I do great in my college courses something is just not clicking in my brain with highschool. For me everything is horrible about highschool. The sound, the restriction, the structure, the compression of schedules, sudden changes, etc...

How do I cope with highschool for the time I have left?

Everything is too loud and crowded and I it keeps hurting me until I get to class, and it just makes me so nervous I can’t speak. I am also shorter than all the other boys and because of this I always get pushed in the hallways because there are so many people and it scares me. I can’t even speak because of the loud noises and how crowded it is. I feel like people always laugh at me because everyone is looking at me because I am so small and push me. It’s so bright too. I do not know what to do.

Is there any tips I can have to help out with this? I just want to be able to go through the hallways without being scared.

A more definite answer would be great, but the ignorance would be better if it protects my future opportunities. Are my frears justified, and if so what areas could become problematic with a diagnosis?",5.216470588235296,7.1850425588235325,6.272696078431372,72.7996323529412,69.49019607843138,9.02156862745098,30.39705882352941,9.516144504307137,3.038270588235294,439,18,75,10,8,146,68,102,0.094,0.7140000000000001,0.192,0.8746,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,2,5,5,0,0,10,0,13,1,0,2,1,26,18,8,0,10,6,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,5,2,0,2,4,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,7,3,10,9,2,11,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,5,6,58,12,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12852147185611626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20872751569758655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16714862632276298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19414749538780413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3017904793279809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934419690559209,0.16538872748687905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17095465735586668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874085080682243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083650460296156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875460270609677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16725253371182044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2058683833590847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19082868445148102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808404265881364,0.0,0.18998979714171568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19431590428340287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15190512018027869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12109884858728358,0.0,0.0,0.11020312464034067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11147275207897712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919311936022346,0.0,0.5370197785129143,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,-Lexx-,2019/01/20,"Harmful Hyperfixations So, i define a special interest as something that I have an extreme interest in for a long period of time and a hyperfixation as something that is the same except short lived. I know some people don't think of it that way so I wanted to clarify first.

My question is: How do you ignore a hyperfixation? I have a lot of mental health issues that stem from trauma, and I'm currently hyperfixated on DID, which is a trauma disorder. Because of this it's very triggering for my trauma issues, but I'm so hyperfixated on it that it's always on my mind and I've done tons of research and when I talk to my friends I'm info dumping about it. I've been very fatigued and have been disassociating (I have Depersonilization/derealization disorder related to CPTSD) so having this DID thing rattling around in my head is becoming a real problem for me.",6.013325942350331,7.168197317073172,7.7806430155210675,65.83398004434592,66.6829268292683,10.353880266075388,33.20177383592018,10.436869588844218,3.74139756097561,696,30,119,18,11,244,93,164,0.141,0.795,0.064,-0.8882,1,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,0,1,8,12,1,0,9,0,16,3,1,2,0,22,22,14,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,14,6,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,8,0,1,5,0,14,4,22,17,4,14,0,1,0,0,4,7,0,3,6,92,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14329627331247882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15330743103369165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498037065049644,0.19019740295785434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3947455111087094,0.0,0.0,0.17623524169621896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14648557952109234,0.0,0.0,0.1330525080351635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17674177753107764,0.18305597762825784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594944243958599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09464459431594678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15206857293865225,0.1524044275801106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14641062324105172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.173551727063484,0.0,0.17388756854233586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11939186171729295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478603394431024,0.0,0.0,0.19291967131020527,0.0,0.0,0.19601782201435744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26515829645269395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13841950476787965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11441167230676337,0.11034810827652697,0.0,0.0,0.10041966932046363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841900232897118,0.10157658359094507,0.13669586704969833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,NovaeCaelum,2019/01/20,"How do you deal with handling intense life situations? I'm 32, high-functioning (self-diagnosed, but working on getting diagnosed), and dealing with a lot of very intense/stressful situations right now (health, finances, family, career)--some of which would be as stressful to NT people, some of which wouldn't.

I'm finding myself on the verge (or over the verge) of meltdowns often, and the NT people in my life can't seem to understand why, which then I have to explain, which makes it more intense...and I often end up in a place where I feel like I can't handle the world at all and pretty much want to retreat, hide, stop doing everything, never go outside, etc. It doesn't help that I'm so sensory-sensitive that I literally can't physically handle a lot of what's going on around me, either. All this together makes one nasty combination.

Have any of you here ever developed strategies to help when life ramps up in intensity like this? I'd love any advice on how to get a better handle on how to deal with life intensities. And how to deal with the people around you who don't understand, or aren't sure how to respond when you're in higher intensity mode, too.",9.379864864864864,7.4717580675675705,9.279711711711707,68.0722702702703,60.66666666666667,12.483603603603608,38.41621621621621,11.20814326018867,4.22346162162162,929,36,167,20,10,305,125,222,0.098,0.789,0.112,0.4927,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,3,0,2,17,6,0,1,9,0,13,7,0,7,5,41,29,17,0,3,4,0,1,2,0,2,6,0,0,0,12,10,0,1,6,0,1,2,8,1,0,1,0,1,11,5,35,26,9,31,0,0,0,1,13,21,0,8,10,114,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10619394711720376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14780266247887322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934839275643548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09611239135141816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44814815057393576,0.0,0.2206015094799396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09625197614708088,0.0,0.12119906349069348,0.0,0.0983009031698936,0.0,0.0,0.09766823845007906,0.0,0.10244718379245113,0.0,0.05494830779919143,0.07763597581263024,0.0,0.0,0.09932510575638136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11355426010850675,0.0,0.12352268151059087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551426201859795,0.0,0.0,0.14568237272316467,0.11481893619119207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070356682411974,0.10618422628536783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18477970852957648,0.09808157850523687,0.0,0.14508007338739667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988712089858445,0.0,0.0838152770236689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07363960208790092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260204169673175,0.0,0.11354010087160787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105594568137472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09280610386993962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989317704493054,0.11336958552273192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2443058936896909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085545063613992,0.2489689896853529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10242296746121736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22626474298928625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966656330673045,0.06409812038865195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980604326342826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911520048101843,0.0,0.0,0.07719814432728017,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Jstef06,2019/01/20,"What’s going on with my ASD, semi-verbal child? So my son is technically non-verbal except he has a pretty decent vocab, can read (I assume from memory) tons of books aloud but struggles to tell me what he wants or needs, even though he knows the words and can ask. He’s capable. Just not using them.

My question for ASD adults is what’s going on? Sometimes he looks really intent to say something, even taking a breath to prepare a word or statement then stops. If I tell him what to say, then sometimes he’ll whisper it. 

Can someone shed some light on what he’s going through? I would love to know so that I can be a better dad.

Thanks!",2.74982244318182,4.578770757812503,3.790369318181821,88.61315340909094,75.796875,5.904545454545455,21.01136363636364,6.574015621080383,0.3365375000000004,499,12,100,4,11,161,86,128,0.039,0.8109999999999999,0.15,0.9492,0,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,1,1,6,4,0,1,5,0,9,2,1,2,0,23,23,10,0,4,7,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,2,7,2,0,1,5,2,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,5,10,3,14,20,2,9,0,0,1,1,20,3,0,6,3,61,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17107066775234098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16183951919335268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2417259421311821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31199179061190896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20113270710600256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15366526090777832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16515534868936954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13568454393247706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18616631093479788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2049903432154283,0.0,0.18303921966092726,0.0,0.1172278875706386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29104150829590897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15504657902774044,0.14087441116581634,0.3619629847665213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15298758297757525,0.0,0.1913005658150086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13758548108790636,0.0,0.31988212688118856,0.16847233036382667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17978645120897166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15804434779431106,0.0,0.0,0.1079320661887163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12999063268403138,0.0,0.0,0.0

My Aspie bf says he never found this girl attractive when he dated her, but he lied to her and said he loved her body, etc. He tells me the same thing and I think “how do I know you’re not lying to me?”. Like look at him. He told her to her face he loved her body, she believed him, he never gave her a reason to think he’s a liar. She breaks up with him. He’s hurt and tries to get her back (he tells me the reason why he tried is because he was desperate and didn’t want to be alone - not because he loved her). He’s with me now. It’s been a year since they broke up. He tells me she was fat and ugly and never found her attractive. But is he lying to me so I won’t be hurt or leave him? He says I’m his first love, and he HAS done things for me that he never did for her...but I can’t help but wonder, yknow? What do you think? Why would he lie to her but swears he wouldn’t lie to me?

autism,scarlettruby14,2019/01/20,"Possibly autistic? (Long post ahead)

(Also I’m new to Reddit and to this sub, but I read the rules and I think it’s safe to post this)

Hiya:

I’m a 14 year old female and I suspect I may have a form of autism. The stories and facts about me below are there for context as to why I suspect this. 

I was practically mute until the age of 3, but I could read at the age of 2. When I took a test to get into kindergarten, my intelligence was at a 12th grade level, but I had the emotional and social maturity of an 18 month old. The doctors suspected I was autistic back then, but revoked the diagnosis when I started speaking. 

I do believe I am smart; my social skills aren’t terrible either, my mom says I’m more intuitive and empathetic than most, but I’m still a social outcast no matter how hard I try, because I feel like I got left behind around the age of 9-10 when everyone else kept developing .

A few years back, when I was 11, my only friend stopped talking to me when I started homeschooling, so I took to social media and attempted to make friends on there. I experienced a lot of cyberbullying and talked to people I shouldn’t have at such a young age, but my parents didn’t find out about the whole thing until almost two years later, shortly after I turned 13, and I got in trouble with my phone revoked for two months.

However, a few months afterward, I was perfectly fine and happy as if nothing ever happened, but I had a strong aversion to anything that reminded me of the experience; certain video games and shows. Then suddenly, I suppose everything hit me all at once, and I shut down for a few months, attempting suicide and everything. My parents decided that I should see a therapist.

My depressive periods are almost nonexistent now, they’re very few and far between. I’m generally pretty happy now! 

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder back in June, to no one’s surprise as it runs in the family from my mother’s side. My mother’s family also has a few autistic kids. 

I took a sleep study in August, for my mom believes that there’s something up that the doctors haven’t caught yet. Apparently, I have a tendency to zone out with a blank stare whenever I’m being scolded or yelled at. I show little to no emotion, which concerns my parents greatly. Combining a lot of other things, like my high intelligence with my lack of friends and anxiety when it comes to socializing, my mother told me shortly afterwards that she suspects that I may have Asperger’s.

I didn’t think much of it at the time, but recently, I remembered this out of nowhere, and started doing my research. Just the other day, I came across this Tumblr post (http://p-3a-s-life-resources.tumblr.com/post/115347374289/atypical-autism-traits) for atypical autism, or PDD-NOS, and found that I fit all of the criteria almost to a T. 

So with all this, do you guys think I should talk to my parents about possibly getting a diagnosis? If you’d like, you can question me further in the comments in case I was unclear about anything.

I have a meeting this week with a large sports team about improving the experience for people with autism and other sensory issues + anxiety. 

I have several ideas as my son is on the spectrum but I feel like this is a great chance to really make a difference so I would love some input from people who have this issues as well as friends, carers, parents and other family. Everything will be confidential I just want to represent these communities as best as I can, I also want to add that I am not being paid for this meeting or benefitting in any way, I have been invited due to my own mental health issues.

autism,its_complikated,2019/01/20,"I think I have Asperger’s? (18 F) Hi everyone,

This is my first post here but I have been following this subreddit for the past few weeks. 

I have been tested for autism by a professional after my mom was convinced I had it. The results said I could be a very high functioning autistic, but there were characteristics about me that pointed towards no. I have had therapy for the last couple years (which included CBT) and have been told by my therapist that it was possible that I could’ve been formally diagnosed with it before I started. However, I am still thinking that I have Asperger’s and have recently taken some of the online tests that I have found on here (and were said to be pretty accurate). The  results said that it was most/highly likely that I have it. I am currently in university, and am thinking of asking the counsellor about getting a second opinion.  What are my next steps from here? I feel lost and don’t know what to do next... I’ll answer your questions if you have any/take any advice.

autism,novalife2k16,2019/01/20,"My parent is on the edge of disowning my autistic brother My brother used to be great for the first 2-3 years of his life. His dad would often de-parent him when my mom did try to raise him. Often telling my brother to hit my mom and he would do it. Other times, spoiling him and letting him do whatever he wants. Even after my brother went through Luekeumia, his dad would keep spoiling and treating him like a child years later. 

He’s 13 now and is addicted to fortnite, refuses to learn at all. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a very loving kid, he loves me ( his brother ) and his mom but he’s stuck in this premature mindset while everyone in his grade listens to their parents, is literate and can write. 

My mom is getting old now, it really drains her mental health when she tries to get my brother to cooperate.
 
She wants to call social services or whatever and see if they can take him away because it’s deteriorating her mental health.

What other alternatives or solutions are there? Any people with autism who has been in my brothers shoes who has made progress?

autism,IsabellaHamsterthief,2019/01/20,"Resources for or by autistic parents of autistic kids? I'm autistic, and at least one of my kiddos is, too. I'm looking for books and other resources to help me help him. Every book I've found has assumed the parents/caregivers don't understand why their kids are different, and don't have any of the challenges that ASD can bring. They have some helpful stuff, but they ""taste"" horrible, and are missing a lot of the information and perspective I would find most useful.

autism,HopelessAnhedonic,2019/01/20,"SOMEONE HELP! NOBODY IS HELPING AND I AM IN DISTRESS!!! I just searched for the tag ""amwf"" on Instagram then search for ""imwf""

AMWF: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/amwf/

IMWF: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/imwf/

If you don't know, AMWF refers to a couple which is Asian Male White Female and IMWF refers to a couple which is Indian Male White Female.

The AMWF tag produces **62,000** results. Every single one of the pictures are of a couple which is Asian Male White Female. I should also add, all the females are quite attractive.

The IMWF tag produces **1,900** results. Let that sink in. That is 3% of the size of the AWMF results. And it does not end there - literally *NONE* of the photos are of Indian Male White Female couples. They are all pictures of IMWF Mas-Wrestling World Cup and International Mice &amp; Wedding Forum. So there is literally close to 0 pictures of IMWF couples. So, 0 vs. 62,000. If ever anyone needed evidence, this proves it well beyond any doubt.

IT IS OVER FOR CURRYCELS! **OVER!!!! OVER!!!! OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

#OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST KILL ME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


I don't want to live if Indians men are seen as this ugly by whtie women. There is literally one thing I want in live or I want to be dead. I don't want to live anymore.

autism,silver_penguin,2019/01/20,"Does anybody else get anxiety attacks from sensory overload? I get overwhelmed easily by loud noises and bright lights, so events such as concerts and parties give me pretty bad anxiety. I start stimming really intensely (flapping my hands and rocking back and forth), but the experience isn't exactly a meltdown or shutdown. It's more similar to an anxiety attack, where the world seems to speed up and I'm caught in the motions of it, like a tsunami pulling me out to sea. The turbulence makes me panic and hyperventilate. I was wondering if any other autistic people have similar experiences.

autism,GoldenHoneyCyclops,2019/01/21,"Get a fidget spinner -My theripist So. Apparently I am doing a sort of subconscious self harm???   
I pick on my face and my skin and I bleed really badly, and most times I scratch mysyself or pull out my hair when i dont realize it, so my theripst suggested something like a fidget spinner or something, but knowing me id probably brake it, and since all the nerotypicals (no offence)  turned them into a toy, the prices have skyrocketed. 

Fun./s

Im just looking for something that is hardy. I have a fidget cube but it was 30 bucks, and thats concetered cheep, so its not very good and it just makes me upset that its... Just not good. Plus the size is so small and not really for holding in general. 

ANYWAYS, any suggestions on a brand?   
And any sugestions other then spinners themselves? (other then slime, chews, tangles or any type of slime or sand. These are all things my mother has told me are not aloud. All but the tangles. I jsut dont like those)

autism,Natalie1316,2019/01/21,"Help. Do I change my sons school?? I have a 5 nearly 6 year old boy. He is currently being assessed for autism, ADHD and a range of other issues including anxiety and OCD. 

He can be the most lovely, intelligent and amazing kid in the world but he can also be intimidating, loud, unreasonable and incredibly difficult. The problem is his school he’s in year 1 now and they have started to realise that his issues are deeper than “just bad behaviour” and have applied for and EHCP (education, health and care plan) in it they state he has no relationships with his class mates and is failing at a mainstream school. 

I feel like they just can’t cope with him. They put him in the nursery with children that are 2-4 years old because he can get out of the normal class room and hides in different locations in the school.  He goes to a separate class room for lunch because he finds the main lunch hall to be too overwhelming. They let him run around bare foot because he refuses to wear his shoes, they have recently got him slippers which he will wear occasionally but prefers to be bare foot. 

He is behind with his learning he cannot read or write, and struggles with numbers and by putting him in the nursery I feel they aren’t helping him to improve, they are making out like his anxieties make him impossible to teach and have said they believe he is “intensely demand-avoidant”. 

I understand he is not entirely innocent of what they say, he has been excluded twice for head-butting another child, and he is difficult to deal with and they don’t necessarily have the time or staff to deal with him at all times like I can but I feel like they just don’t want to deal with him. 

Should I change his schools knowing that the change could possibly make him react badly in the new school or do I leave it until they get him moved to a school that will be better equipped to deal with him? I just want what’s best for him but I feel like whatever I do it will be wrong.

autism,Atlae32,2019/01/21,"Should my autistic boyfriend go to counseling? My bf[28M] has severe Asperger’s, I love him but we are going through a rough time. 

He received counseling when he was 14 until he became 17. He told me he learned to cope with it, but I don’t think that’s true.

We’ve been 7 months together and day by day I notice that he really hasn’t coped with it: 

-Usually he asks “What’s wrong?” even if i was just silent staring into blank. And he would insist there’s something wrong. 

-Sometimes he doesn’t act logically. He calls me when I’m asleep, and if i can barely talk on the phone he reacts dramatically.

- He only views things one sidedly. 

-He doesn’t process things properly all the time. For instance, say I’d be in the middle of an urgent situation, he says “I love you” but I’m so preoccupied that i can’t reply. He ends up being mad and doesn’t understand that I COULDN’T reply at the moment. 

-Most of our arguments are due to something mean he said. At the end of the argument, I ask why he said those things, his reply is  usually “ I really don’t know”.

The counseling idea is his, he just approached me and said that maybe he should seek professional counseling.

My mouth is mumble move the answering voice but it doesn't open and I have no sound. It will continue until my my mind suddenly goes blank after a few minutes.

Or a different variation I will say the sentences over and over out loud not finishing it outloud but eventually finishing it in my brain after a couple minutes.

autism,micra_phone,2019/01/21,"Any potty training advice? Hi there! Little Background: I have a 2.5 year old son whom we suspect is on the spectrum but he is currently not diagnosed. He does have a significant speech delay. 

Potty training has not been successful this far. I know it takes a while with all children, but I was just wondering if anyone has any advice or tips for training a non-verbal child on the spectrum.  Let me also say that we are rewarding and praising for successful attempts, no negative consequences or reprimands for accidents.  

The only way that he let us know when he goes is he grabs himself and says “oh no!”  That acknowledgement in itself just started in the past month and I see it as a huge step in the right direction.

I'm an adult. I'm living independently. I have a job, which I'm decent enough at. I'm thinking even if I was diagnosed, I'm not sure if I'd even need or request any assistance, I think I'm doing alright enough on my own. It seems to me at best getting diagnosed would give me some peace of mind, but even then I'm not sure because I may just as well worry I was misdiagnosed either way.

autism,Trans_Autistic_Guy,2019/01/22,"The problem with providers. I was diagnosed with ASD at 25 after having suspected I had something like it for over a decade. It was just missed because I functioned well enough and because people didn't really think about there being people who seem ""normal"" but still are autistic. I was finally diagnosed after I went to a doctor asking to be tested for it after I had done numerous online tests through the years that said I was neuro-atypical. 
At this point, I had had three inpatient hospitalizations the year before because I had developed anxiety and my depression had worsened following having to put my dog down due to severe cancer. Two days after my first hospitalization, I was sexually assaulted by two guys who didn't realize that I didn't really want to do what we did. A few weeks later, I had a second hospitalization followed by PHP and IOP (day programs of differing strictness). Somewhere around this time, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I went back to community college to try to learn to become an ASL interpreter, but following a visit home at Thanksgiving, I ended up in the hospital for the third time.
During all of this, I had a great psychiatrist and a lousy therapist. Then my psychiatrist suddenly left the practice, and I was without one for about 6 months. Originally my GP renewed some of my prescriptions, but then she refused to continue. So I was sent down the path of trying to find new providers. One psychiatrist I saw during this time pulled me cold turkey off of some of my meds and said I should get a guardian because of my autism. This was ignoring the fact that I had lived on my own or with my partner for over 10 years by this point. She also told me I should consider an autism waiver, which is only available to people under 21; I was 25.
I also forgot to mention that during the summer without my good provider, my parents and I tried so hard to find autism resources for me, but all of them required me to be younger or to not be cross diagnosed, and the people who were supposed to help me find providers for my other diagnoses wouldn't help me because I had autism.
The next psychiatrist I saw told me I was lucky that I had only been sexually assaulted once, so once I got the prescriptions I needed, I booked it out of there. After that I found a program that would come to my place for my therapy and give me rides to my psychiatrist. They didn't do anything regarding autism though, so I asked them to help me find a case manager who could help me find resources. This led into having a woman who didn't know what SNAP was as my case manager. Clearly she didn't know anything about any other resources either. I asked my therapist to help me find a new case manager, but nothing came of it until I moved counties in September.
After I moved, the previous case manager couldn't see me anymore, so I again asked my therapist to help me find a new case manager. She kept waffling about how she needed to see if there were any in my new county. Then at the end of November, I got a letter that said my therapist had left the practice. A few weeks later I finally got a new therapist, who i promptly asked about case management. She finally found me one, and because they didn't contact me correctly (I can't talk on phones), there was another delay until my therapy last Thursday. My therapist called the case management people for me, and an appointment was scheduled for an hour and five minutes ago. I haven't heard anything from them cancelling or rescheduling. So now I have to wait until either my partner or my therapist can call them to ask what happened. And you know that if I had just not showed, there would be some sort of consequence, but they can just not come and it's just oops.

TLDR: Trying to get service providers as an adult with autism is practically impossible. And when I do get them, they flake out.",8.031435341423132,7.404030712141888,8.015022976951247,71.95550208228623,62.47885402455661,11.5357076182954,36.47910533496086,10.882677951670544,3.9561208731241475,3084,126,554,70,38,999,294,733,0.08,0.868,0.052000000000000005,-0.9605,3,0,1,0,0,0,70.0,1,1,9,2,31,11,2,0,37,0,65,7,0,3,5,101,112,46,0,14,23,1,1,1,2,5,7,4,1,5,34,28,0,7,18,2,0,17,16,6,1,10,58,10,104,5,96,42,11,95,0,2,4,0,58,25,0,12,54,415,138,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04457129250133336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041979162196444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838594563243505,0.052724272567177,0.03846501704777367,0.0,0.049865486981469885,0.0,0.0,0.12413154844231583,0.044760970909631874,0.28203707612248546,0.0,0.0,0.03866317598914884,0.0,0.18390589230093726,0.055531687951989074,0.042785638607484536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026855518532271,0.05750835256532363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662568578757793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040145485057187465,0.0,0.0,0.06485449051404496,0.0,0.04330716517232625,0.2551720412324209,0.0,0.052533202278523386,0.0,0.051464987864826735,0.0,0.051455173918365314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906852281838393,0.05195397014614992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16524194816872004,0.3216930478646732,0.042769203811022165,0.0,0.1102615861682766,0.0,0.0,0.07880963029899808,0.048234354700378936,0.0,0.042173525193874864,0.12064352176953308,0.05543525336153005,0.0,0.04978634066649456,0.04446354149639422,0.0,0.04504212191005712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20221476366316188,0.0,0.050436191365533095,0.0,0.04951690083415855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289977669769304,0.040985928019334136,0.0,0.0,0.10926144601409543,0.0,0.0,0.02456487793922961,0.0,0.04439926312561041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05585113136466759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0401340123941008,0.10688201836051914,0.0,0.07456581647129487,0.0,0.24280971291055084,0.053474677611817775,0.0,0.04926494726077965,0.04824621349056064,0.0,0.0,0.107095776105992,0.102215624677881,0.07648230963536498,0.0,0.0,0.05583137545213137,0.0,0.0,0.17429343160802474,0.0,0.052533202278523386,0.0,0.09506406327658404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04811236364709482,0.05877608811238925,0.05054654195291345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442290990976725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14348694324072106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08013528934508872,0.04577415969237905,0.0,0.0568034981832501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038708961183226136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04015466955529926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04041416247382746,0.0,0.0,0.11500197814570814,0.4086628299910073,0.0,0.03221819341172737,0.04940107080856977,0.0,0.08795820007355623,0.0,0.0,0.09609177432317936,0.0,0.13655066721207618,0.0,0.09823494617132997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029657182776840638,0.0,0.08066516835764724,0.0,0.04520888043259577,0.09322244117208546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09693865744602932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07143671179326516,0.0,0.0,0.09713842541241273

autism,pinkyporkchops,2019/01/22,"Curious about the inner world of a non-verbal person Hello everyone! I want to start by saying I’m a neurotypical person who is still learning so I apologize for my ignorance and I mean no disrespect. I’m a friend to a 5 year old with autism who is largely non-verbal and I would love some insight as to what that experience is like. For example- do you formulate the words in your head and are just unable to say them aloud? Do you understand what people say to you? Do you have an inner dialogue or do you just think in a different, more abstract way? When communicating what are pet peeves you may have about the person talking to you? Does it irritate or frustrate you when people try to get you to talk?
I’d appreciate any insight at all. I just love my friend so much and want to understand better what he’s going through and how I can be better when interacting with him.

autism,jessicatmeister,2019/01/23,"18 month old tv consumption haaaalp Hello my 18 month old has autism and loves the tv above all things in life. It's gotten to where we turn on the tv to pacify him if he's having a meltdown. I think it's therapeutic for him but I'm also afraid that I'm conditioning him to be a little tv addict. Sometimes he just watches and laughs and smiles and sometimes he plays with his toys and does his busy toddler business with the tv in the background. I feel like there's so much anti-tv-for-toddlers stuff and it really freaks me out that I'm ruining him or something. I don't know what to do, it's the only thing we've found that successfully calms him down and improves his mood when he's having a hard time.

autism,aspieneuro_throwaway,2019/01/23,"Thank you TLDR Thanks for all who are supportive of people on the spectrum, it means so very much. 

A few weeks ago, I had a heart to heart with one of my bosses. I'm on the spectrum, and some of the people I was working with had just been butting heads. Things were unclear, and they don't do conflict conversations very well.  

It caused problems, the job was ending. But I didn't tell them I was on the spectrum because there were some slanderous things said by team members. Half joking, off-collar, the kind of stuff we hate. It didn't need to be really bad &lt;fill in your own example&gt; for it to be an unsafe, unwelcome and unwanted environment. Just happened that fast. 

But then they started talking about trying to hire people on the spectrum, not knowing that here I was, with the condition they thought would be helpful. It's a software shop, so it makes sense. But then I had to tell them that no, you shouldn't actually do that. Because I'm autistic, and you guys are terrible to work with for someone on the spectrum and here's why. (mostly communication). 

And most people still think autism has to do with lacking empathy, or an ability to connect with others (seems I have the opposite problem, if so.) 

And my boss then tells me that his child has autism. And in that brief moment, I went from feeling alone to feeling understood. 

Many close friends of mine don't know because I didn't find out till later in life and it never came up. They just say ""That's Fred, being Fred."" or as my Mom used to say ""I have a Frank!"" 

All that to say, for those that work or live with those on the spectrum - thank you. Being around people who know that my flaws are a condition, rather than character, and who can understand that are so energy giving. And very, very, rare.

autism,HuttarMP,2019/01/23,"Participants Needed for ASD and Relationships Research Study Hello, my name is Michael Huttar and I am conducting a thesis study that is exploring the experiences of adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder during the partner selection process.

&amp;#x200B;

I am inviting men and women who meet the following criteria to participate:

* Self-identified as having Autism Spectrum Disorder or Asperger's Syndrome
* Over the age of 18
* Do not require significant assistance completing daily tasks (e.g. getting dressed, completing basic job tasks, etc.)

Participation in the study will involve:

* A short electronic survey
* A 45 minute - 1 hour phone interview in which you will be asked about you experiences and/or views related to:
   * Dating
   * Attraction (e.g. romantic, sexual, or emotional)
   * Emotions
   * Your relationship dynamics (e.g. coping behaviors, communication)
* A possible short follow-up interview

If you meet the criteria and are interested in sharing your experiences and/or perspectives, please email me at [michael.huttar@und.edu](mailto:michael.huttar@und.edu) and I will then send you the link to a consent form, which will provide you with more detailed information about the study, as well as a brief demographics survey.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

It is hoped that the current study can ultimately inform practitioners in their work with clients presenting with relationship concerns.

If you know someone who might be interested in this study, I would sincerely appreciate you passing along this information.

&amp;#x200B;

Gratefully,

autism,Katmatt16,2019/01/23,"Need help with a kindergartner with violent and aggressive meltdowns Hi everyone, 
I have a 5 year old student who is progressively getting more violent. I am afraid for his safety, and ours. He will hit, kick, bite, pull hair, throw things, throw himself on the floor, etc. These behaviors are happening when we have to tell him “no” or transition from a preferred activity. I know many of you have experience in this area. Is there anything that has worked for you? We are at the end of our rope and have tried so many strategies but nothing seems to work for long. I can see the pain and despair in his eyes as he works through these feelings and my heart just breaks for him. 

Thank you for any advice!

autism,Christhor96,2019/01/23,"I will thank you for giving me some advice Hi all. The reason for this post is to ask for some advice, the weekend my uncles came to my house and they have a son with autism (as I see they did not give him the necessary care)
The problem is the following. He is 14 years old, the only thing he does is look in all the drawers of my room and the rooms of my brothers (he takes things out of his place, leaves everything messy, breaks many things). We try to ask him to stop or take him to another place but he just starts screaming and starts to spit on us. We know it's a bit complicated but we're a little desperate. He continues to disconnect our computers when we are playing a game, he turns off the television when we are watching and begins to hit the furniture so that we leave where we are because he wants to be alone in our rooms and in our game room (where we have many things important and valuable as television, 3 computers, consoles, some collections and other things) We really appreciate some advice on what we can do to improve the situation.",6.144599358974363,6.096447081730767,6.3738461538461575,80.2378205128205,66.16346153846155,10.394871794871797,30.794871794871803,10.125756701596842,2.7867391025641024,835,28,169,18,12,268,121,208,0.07,0.84,0.09,0.7603,0,1,0,0,0,0,20.0,13,1,2,0,6,6,0,0,15,0,14,1,1,1,2,35,33,15,0,2,5,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,4,0,10,19,0,1,2,4,0,2,1,2,0,0,2,4,27,4,26,28,7,30,0,0,3,0,36,16,0,5,10,115,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3573182089185858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262376470067571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12780861468265092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278948337152328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430087441229191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330684812950395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13940567628867012,0.12427140223504365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10666369081289112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095437200160407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338492597128732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14064064735026693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06698562857510948,0.0,0.0,0.25812039270574216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12216228604091835,0.0,0.0,0.10235395565616123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2471475447538546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278993701810215,0.0,0.0,0.09270016982947392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2546908845259789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11673356710969235,0.0,0.0,0.11662891202544982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808360806592195,0.1253196142775604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09712775368630916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13700552421804446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17254377322907902,0.0,0.0,0.10190256530021873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832869465357521,0.0,0.0,0.11221670616690704,0.0,0.0,0.404879847665356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08275292744973754,0.13257750306312235,0.0,0.0,0.1466144427799769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189181114388446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784909048521952
autism,skullie66,2019/01/23,"Eczema and SPD Hi.  I’m posting this to multiple subreddits looking for help. I have a 5 year old autistic son. He has worsening eczema. Because of his sensory processing disorder, he can’t stand the feel of lotion or the steroid cream that was prescribed by the doc. He is ok with oils in the tub or any kind of moisturizing soap in the tub.  Does anyone have suggestions to help him tolerate the creams?

I know you shouldn't take quizzes as truth, but I do feel like I understand myself better through them. She did tell me to stop reading autism forums which I'm not sure is very fair. I'm scared to mention my thoughts to my mental health doctor (the person who prescribes me my depression meds?) as well so aaa??

autism,Janbirdy,2019/01/24,"I'm angry (Apologies for formatting. This post is essentially transcribed from a rant I had to my partner about autistic protrayal on tv, I'm sorry if it's been said before)

My opinion is that the autism examples in current pop culture are not ok. They're either characatures of autism or stolen ""quirky"" traits from autism ignoring the difficulties that can come with it.

For example, if an ""autistic"" character is on TV you can bet either they are a  stereotypical characature of autistic traits, or they are shown to have ""autistic traits"" but aren't actually explicitly stated to be autistic.

In some cases (e.g. Bones) the writers have even admitted to basing them on autistic people they know, but they won't actually reveal (in-show-universe) that they have autism.

In the case of Bones it has even been admitted that the writers didn't explicitly write that Brennan has autism into the script (despite basing her off a real autistic person) so that they would appeal to a wider audience.

This makes me so fucking angry

It's like autism is this thing that you can't name because of the shame - because God forbid you tell your viewers they're watching someone with autism

Or if your viewers are ""charitable"" enough to watch a character with autism  on TV, you have to use autism as the principle point of the character, because otherwise you're not really portraying autism right? (/s)

I am not my fucking autism.
I am me
Autism doesn't fucking define me

Maybe it contributes to my personality but it is not in itself my personality.

And how fucking dare producers cherry pick the quirks they like from autistic tendencies without attributing them to the condition.

I'd pay good money for a program that showed a character as ""normal"" on the surface, with maybe a few issues (I.E. the autism traits) and then at some point during the series that character would open up to another character that they were autistic - and that's how the audience finds out too.

That doesn't seem so hard, but it doesn't exist.

It's like autism is this dirty word

And you feel the shame that goes along with it - mostly thanks to people like these producers and writers and such deciding it would turn away audiences.",8.567580314422422,8.695576107769426,7.867141717931192,70.96192925495559,61.105263157894754,11.264570517202095,36.6827295511506,10.832165505486646,4.076848621553886,1773,74,296,40,22,554,187,399,0.08800000000000001,0.843,0.069,-0.6154,2,0,0,0,0,0,53.0,0,7,10,2,10,16,4,2,25,1,35,6,2,8,2,66,52,24,0,7,17,0,2,4,1,4,0,1,0,4,30,16,0,2,8,4,4,1,12,8,0,0,6,7,29,8,47,41,7,25,0,0,4,4,30,20,4,12,6,203,59,4,0.0,0.0,0.23460501529929395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12604517346267638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112936330492623,0.0,0.0,0.21982712105079566,0.0,0.10228539868654513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10354575852617763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420365156868785,0.0,0.15878822281670402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060779139251943365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098649744782484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4445094608599349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008220510168554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076798558395767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546254101136106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06606139339058331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349038991098177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802376118234573,0.0,0.24152367944163916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11777514455420494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16666969310916666,0.3148744841429191,0.0,0.0,0.2272647067912966,0.0,0.11512293401968487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13681933495777032,0.07700624834795862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265420968294828,0.11434225496654875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10942990045397016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10184910448818843,0.0,0.0,0.13455938938658155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050642599434492,0.11066839453145233,0.0,0.0,0.07985870241569742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13074826303635798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10381831958633804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158731007379544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2561700415528589,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,bxkrish,2019/01/24,"Regarding BAER test I need some help in making a decision for my 3.5 yr old son who is advised for BAER test. This involves IV and Anasthesia and it will help diagnose if he has any hearing loss.

My son was diagnosed with Autism when he was 2. Since then we have attempted Audiology test twice and he doesn't want to co-operate. The Doctors, the small room kind of scares him. Hence they are recommending BAER test.

In a normal day my son doesn't seem like he has trouble with hearing but at times he doesn't turn up when you call him and we were thinking he is doing selective listening as he is more interested in what he is currently doing rather than focussing on what I want him to do.

Also last 18 months he is getting ABA, speech therapy, OT, special school with extended day. On top of this he gets screen time and we speak to him all the time. But he hasn't picked up a single word. He does make noise and the same noise when he wants something or frustrated or sleepy or hungry or thirsty. We just have to try all the options before I guess the right one.

So my thought was and only because I have seen many gifs and videos on Reddit when the kids are so happy to hear their first words by using a hearing aid. I was wondering if my son also falls under that category (somewhat) and I will not be doing justice if I do not offer him this benefit of doubt just because I feel it will be painful for him when he undergoes the test.

I request parents of autistic kids or kids who are now adults with autism, based on your experience what may be going on with my son, why is he not able to speak or imitate words. Will this test lead me to somewhere or is there another test that can be done to see why there is no speech? 

He does understand few words like shoes, jacket, cap etc but I am not sure if he understands them as objects with the sound of those words. If I ask him to bring the 'ball' to me he never takes those instructions. So my concern is if he never hears or understands the word ""ball"" or ""bring"" or ""here"" then how can he speak those words.",6.420019810697777,5.672703527845037,6.4742207792207775,82.08189247193485,65.77966101694915,10.124103015628439,31.605657054809605,9.457814108942452,2.477480387409201,1619,53,343,27,22,516,208,413,0.076,0.867,0.058,-0.4246,2,0,1,0,0,0,37.0,4,2,3,5,18,14,1,2,15,0,44,6,1,6,5,84,76,43,0,12,26,6,1,2,0,5,5,12,1,4,16,19,0,0,9,3,0,5,11,6,0,3,8,16,36,8,40,59,9,41,0,1,3,0,65,16,0,24,22,218,52,12,0.09654010441531237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544061732438925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06565058150365329,0.10123071696622332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025196567216542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11769990319744257,0.0,0.0821485183427594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09857824043878556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12452076156861093,0.0,0.0,0.19597234765661745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09881288762355972,0.16896579189224614,0.09879404482520167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10766773564717833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094434746711831,0.0,0.0,0.0488135774979599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821169634981295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100876440022265,0.0,0.05486596610680132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063498090410765,0.0,0.0,0.10276873630604724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5440385699856538,0.0,0.12941759402304145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10053166275702667,0.0,0.07869307013457326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943292371765812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888253868683486,0.09787651330857668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07705739029798149,0.0,0.0,0.07158326416873279,0.1489153600674867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09458880492201596,0.0,0.0,0.101302599790331,0.0,0.0654180732293557,0.07342309967156017,0.10272547768134636,0.0,0.10719636120211104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244472168450794,0.0,0.0,0.09665348607711097,0.0977037396984886,0.07692996412955001,0.08788648526695142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798589719902586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07432128890167257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09098790590622573,0.0,0.07258614395607962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040202295243644,0.0,0.0,0.06185900079076695,0.0,0.07664205927145125,0.16887993371856894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655443938391105,0.10500791141501463,0.0,0.3015049600979531,0.0,0.08337965379583165,0.0,0.0,0.17082556455602446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1742248567642866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10469362511326563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Desireoftheunknown,2019/01/24,"Trouble communicating with my sister I[21F]have autism even though I'm on the higher end of the spectrum. Today my sister[23F] and I got into a fight because she wanted to go out but my phone was charging and I tried to explain that I needed my phone to distract me and to keep me from getting over stimulated. She then brought up her problems with me; According to my sister I'm too quiet, constantly look mad, and don't behave like any other person She's ever met(I'm not sure what this means).

autism,amethicc,2019/01/24,"UK diagnosis process? So I've been diagnosed with dyspraxia recently and I'm waiting for the report to show to my GP. The psychologist who assessed me for dyspraxia also noticed quite a few autism traits in me (as did my college as they recommended I was screened for ASD in the first place and set me up with the psychologist) so gave me the AQ10, I got 8/10. She told me in the report she's recommending autism investigations and diagnostic testing, since a psychologist cannot diagnose autism, only a psychiatrist I think? Anyway I've read horror stories about how it's taken people up to 2 years just to see a psychiatrist to be assessed, I hope that isn't the case with me. I want to have a diagnosis by the time I go to university if possible (September this year) so that they can support me not just for dyspraxia and OCD but for autism too (if that is even the case, it seems likely though). Obviously though I want to be realistic, but I would like to know if the process really is this long? Just to help me acclimatise to the concept of another round of testing for yet another mental or neurological issue. Many thanks.",6.052478405315617,6.995304762790703,7.303471760797343,70.05308139534884,66.48837209302326,11.166112956810633,33.49667774086379,11.062562989136584,3.9354584717607963,904,39,167,27,14,308,121,215,0.011,0.897,0.092,0.9279,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,2,2,15,5,0,0,16,0,12,3,0,1,1,27,28,19,0,7,10,0,1,2,0,1,3,0,0,0,8,7,0,1,3,2,0,1,3,0,0,1,7,3,22,5,31,18,1,15,0,0,3,0,8,6,0,6,9,116,30,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12726151096207675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337372781474717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32304067312351475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10510824775931056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13536154197517514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09044101800407532,0.0,0.127276105864995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10666593319707407,0.0,0.0,0.15805858736824355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16609730383288293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745733380791093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554922448862213,0.0,0.0,0.140830915838492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16133957224203108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16037230056754706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18117811575814685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210305832651222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11032530679248627,0.0,0.1662639149593457,0.0,0.0,0.17940264728366065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1692614017627207,0.15917970144347054,0.0,0.10194700446664072,0.0,0.15712823046247198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12681129604735086,0.14487201739728287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13163947044145097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18058636959695867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14651163449274848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196833121176632,0.31270187536900057,0.0,0.09279385266655484,0.0,0.0,0.15206187612222982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18772582295666604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11304610093630653,0.0,0.0,0.2049575532114709

autism,Lady_Bernkastel,2019/01/24,"How weird is too weird? I'm not so much asking for personal opinions regarding this, but, rather, some actual data about how I can expect strangers to react to what I seem to be becoming. It is clear that there is some point at which human reactions begin to change from, ""This person is weird and should be avoided,"" to, ""This person is weird and must be punished."" I very much wish to avoid the latter, for reasons which should be obvious. These types of reactions, of course, will vary not only between individuals but also depending upon location, but, as social behaviour of this type is almost entirely foreign to me, any data would be most helpful.

Over the past few years, I've found myself trapped within something of a positive feedback loop between social isolation and eccentric behaviour. I've also moved to a rural area in which many of the residents seem rather sheltered. The reactions I've been receiving are beginning to scare me—not because I care if someone thinks I'm a freak or something, but, rather, because I'm beginning to sense genuine hostility from even random strangers. I don't even have to *do* anything to attract it; my appearance and mannerisms alone seem to be sufficient. 

I went to buy groceries a few days ago and noticed that the woman two places back in line spent the entire time—a period of several minutes—wearing a glare so rife with consternation, an observer would have thought that I had just consumed a live kitten right there at the register. I've overheard exclamations of shock and bewilderment on numerous occasions. Two different people have called me a freak to my face. I don't particularly care about any of these incidents in and of themselves, but the apparent consistency of them has me beginning to wonder whether there are things I *should* be concerned about. 

Thank you.

autism,2squirrelpeople,2019/01/24,Just received my sons diagnosis Hi. First time here. I got the report back from the school psychologist. My nugget is on the ASD spectrum. We've suspected as much for awhile so no surprises. I guess my question is there anyone on the spectrum or parents of ASD kids that can tell me what was helpful for you or any books/reading materials? No fear mongering please. We choose to take a positive approach to this. Basic info he will be 3 soon. He is already in early intervention services since 18 months and will be transitioning to a day school soon. ,3.3722065313327434,6.157199495145633,4.21521624007061,81.51925860547222,78.32038834951456,7.240600176522506,27.81023830538393,8.296473431620573,2.265842718446602,440,19,79,9,11,141,80,103,0.109,0.792,0.099,-0.0227,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,1,1,0,1,7,2,0,1,6,0,9,0,0,0,0,10,12,5,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,0,0,2,2,1,0,1,2,0,8,1,11,6,1,13,0,0,0,0,12,3,0,4,8,51,11,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480614813187934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528649863695003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15717847482052744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17284972272956722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14497102755172292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2529513743962123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19120635671974648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17978518968397675,0.0,0.24763165439073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506720755032829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17942532492137506,0.0,0.1652465989779622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24960282024476604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467520427231741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25181637408536833,0.0,0.2248509460857417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4549991940719533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18594870578707465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1690141907706216,0.0,0.19647646826290605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13107692358893816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,PhoenixTears14,2019/01/24,"Please help me get my son to sleep It is almost 8am and he’s been up since 0100. He’s four years old and on the spectrum. Nonverbal. He gets 25mg of trazadone and 2.5mg of melatonin every night. 


He has no trouble falling asleep. He’s usually out by 7:30. But he wakes up at least once a night, every night. Sometimes we’re lucky and he falls back asleep right away. Other nights are like today. Sometimes he falls back asleep after three or four hours, but then that makes it incredibly difficult for me to get him up and ready for school. 


His sleeping patterns are affecting the entire family and we’re miserable for it. My husband works evenings and gets home from work at 12:40am. Our son waking up prevents him from going to bed. He and I haven’t slept together in the same bed at the same time in months. 


My son already has black out curtains. We’ve tried white noise and weighted blankets. They’ve done absolutely nothing. I have a red nightlight arriving today. I’m hoping that it maybe does something but I’m not holding my breath. 


I’m at my wits’ end. What else can I do?",1.7120093457943923,4.289617995327107,2.36054953271028,93.38491775700935,84.0,5.2931588785046735,22.578691588785052,6.742157984588678,0.6045964859813098,857,30,175,10,25,265,135,214,0.06,0.866,0.07400000000000001,0.2048,0,0,1,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,0,2,3,6,0,1,6,0,11,10,9,2,0,25,22,14,0,1,5,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,8,11,1,2,0,0,0,4,3,3,0,3,3,4,14,3,26,19,3,36,0,1,3,0,18,15,0,4,18,90,22,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126777521064807,0.0,0.1397127593450397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1189504110359026,0.19470424498140967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11079367662094908,0.12956179273754226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10576298406875054,0.0,0.11213524913104714,0.0,0.0,0.08362200316461138,0.0,0.21334186310711206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11935277525924425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2645854299697993,0.0,0.07195305083066171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848612662993599,0.0,0.126996040913971,0.1257482259942867,0.12468130907610965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061853247823724415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08451042162701468,0.0,0.12719264394004354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010556218074412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.475244244020855,0.0,0.1214817760125028,0.0,0.13285159506356164,0.1348311519549478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13897525959935464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081207471775439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12813193036984774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10472970911902284,0.0,0.2533946673315315,0.0,0.0,0.09746740753152316,0.2504329455974738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07382491866012274,0.0,0.2400151798770639,0.0,0.0,0.08595709574110293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13943851254221146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15417187885738204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843412067183994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08153004891922214

autism,isa62442,2019/01/24,"Guy is in love with me, but it's not mutual I hope this post belongs here

OK, so there's a boy in my class who's on the spectrum, just like me (but I haven't told the class yet). After a P.e. lesson, almost all my classmates were waiting outside the changing rooms for me, asking me if I was in love with that boy, and what I'd do if he asked me.
  Well, I like that boy as a friend, really. And I feel bad for him that he doesn't have a lot of friends. But I don't really like him as a boyfriend.

  This morning, I got a WhatsApp message from him that he wanted to tell me something, and directly after he wrote that he'd tell me in school, and I'm a kind of afraid that he's going to ask me to be his girlfriend.
 
 How do I say 'no' to anyone without hurting them?

Ps. I'm sorry if there are a lot of grammar mistakes in this post. English is not my first language.

autism,SAnonAltAccount,2019/01/25,"Any help when it comes to identifying a relationship? (log post warning) Hey guys, I should probably introduce myself. I’m a 17 M who has high functioning autism. I have a main account, but I’ve use this account for posts that I don’t want people following my main to see.

I’m having a bit of trouble identifying my relationship with my best friend who also has high functioning autism. We’ve known each other for 10 years now and we haven’t had separate relationships when it comes to dating, but we still like each other more than best friends.


Here’s the problem though: She doesn’t like anything romantic, as well as not being touched. I get it to not being touched as I have a had a similar problem. When it comes to anything romantic though, it’s with a lot of typical romantic stuff as well.

She doesn’t like the handholding, the concept of a romantic date, and anything too “lovey dovey” in general. She also doesn’t like the terms “boyfriend” and “girlfriend” as she says it assumes that we would be in a romantic relationship, and she doesn’t like the romantic part. It makes her uncomfortable.

I’ve been okay with respecting her beliefs and not pressure her into anything, however my problem is that I want to be in a romantic relationship in general. I really like her and want to be a relationship with her but I have felt “trapped” to keep holding onto this feeling of wanting a relationship with her in case she changes her mind.

However, I’ve been noticing I’ve been a bit depressed more than usual when it comes to having a girlfriend. I want to be able to call her my girlfriend and do typical relationship stuff teenagers my age do. It’s especially hard considering that we are on the other side of the country in different states. I’m not saying that a long-distance relationship is impossible but I think it would be a challenge considering my wants as well.

I’ve been researching on my own about non-romantic terms for boyfriend/girlfriend but I can’t seem to find any (I guess there are none). I should probably talk to her but I’m afraid this will affect our relationship.

My question is if I should talk to her about my wants even if it does affect us? Are there non-romantic terms for boyfriend/girlfriend that we can use?

autism,MonochroMayhem,2019/01/25,"Is anybody else completely unfazed by gore? Not trying to ask about fetishes because that isn’t what I’m discussing. I’m talking about watching gory films and not really caring about the blood or viscera.

I know it’s not a psychopathy thing because I still feel actual feelings when bad crap happens to people. But I wonder how my autism affects this as well as other factors.

My working hypothesis is a multiple of factors:

1. My childhood and especially my teenage years were very physical within my household, which could desensitize me to violence in general.

2. I had a pretty traumatic experience when I was 8 years old, and to make a long story short, cigarettes led to learning what color cranial fluid is.

3. Autism kinda disconnects the ability to put yourself into others’ experiences because of mirror neurons.

The traumatic event didn’t really leave me with PTSD, and despite the CPTSD I have due to child abuse, violence and gore in films does not normally trigger intrusive memories (with the exception of if it is emotional and psychological abuse enacted by a feminine parent).

I mean, I obviously don’t blame this all on my autism, but I’ve had several nights where I’ve questioned why I am okay watched things that are normally effed up to most people.

P.S.

autism,garyoable,2019/01/25,"BCaBA/mid-level fading out? Hello, I am currently a mid level clinical supervisor working in ABA field in California. I've been hearing a few rumors that in a few years that the BCaBA/mid-level position will be faded out in the future meaning that the position will not be available in the future. I know a lot of people have said that obtaining the BCBA is more beneficial which I do agree but currently cannot afford to be in a hybrid master degree/BCBA course classes and I do not want to take out loans because I am currently paying off my loans from undergrad. I was thinking about obtaining an BCaBA because I personally enjoy the mid level position and feels great that I have BCBAs to gain support from and definitely cheaper. My biggest worry is that apparently the position supposedly might fade away but is still uncertain. I've asked my RDs why they haven't taken out this position yet if that was the case and they all said that they would have to discharge 200 clients if they were to get rid of mid-levels/BCaBA as of now. But wouldn't that make no difference since population is only going to grow and there would be even more clients in the future, so wouldn't keeping BCaBA/mid levels be crucial.I am really praying that this position does not go away because I love it so much and personally don't really think I am ready for a BCBA. I wanted to ask what you guys think honestly if this position is staying or not because it stresses me out how they just recently updated the BCaBA requirements starting in a couple years I believe but have rumors that it might go away. I do see a lot of agencies hiring BCaBAs in my state and in a lot of other states so I don't if the rumors are true or not. I really hope not. Because money wise, at this point I wouldn't mind being certified as a BCaBA for the rest of my career.

autism,oogiewoogie,2019/01/25,"Workplace undergoing renovations and I'm drowning. My workplace/workspace is undergoing renovations. They built up floor to ceiling temporary walls around my working area while they renovate the space around us. The walls were supposed to absorb sound while construction is going on but it does nothing. I hear banging, drilling, vacuuming and workers screaming at each other. There are 15 people any any time in probably a 100ft by 100ft enclosed space.  We had open concept before.

I am drowning here and having a breakdown. Everyone is poo-pooing my issues. They tell me it is temporary (it will go on 4-6 months). They tell me I'm not the only have to put up with that. They do not know that I am autistic. The walls are keeping the sound in and the air out.  I have a lot of sensory dysfunction. It is too hot in here because there is no ventilation (this might be temporary until they work out the airlow) and I'm extremely sensitive to heat, and it is making me extremely dizzy. I am dealing with a lot of extra noise and people. My anxiety is through the roof. People eat at their desks and in this enclosed space it is creating a lot of extra scents that, while not unpleasant, is strong and I cannot deal with. The construction is creating extra dust and allergens. I feel that these walls are closing in on me. People pick up the phone constantly and it is amplified by the enclosed walls. The list goes on.

I want to take short term disability (my company provides it, full base salary for 3 months) while this construction is going on, but I don't know how I can even get a medical professional to approve it. Now I am a person who has not called in sick a single day in the 20+ years  My family doctor refuses to deal with mental health issues and referred me to a shrink which I can only see next year. I currently see a registered social worker for therapy but since she is not a medical professional, she cannot write me a disability letter. I don't know how to get help.

I'm in Ontario, Canada if anyone can offer me any advice.",3.9862051638837386,6.022813936224492,5.207523191094619,78.88466295609153,72.90306122448979,8.731106988249849,28.715522572665428,9.339509955726095,2.7508017006802725,1621,66,296,39,33,537,194,392,0.049,0.905,0.047,-0.2043,2,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,2,0,7,6,11,2,0,0,25,0,38,6,0,4,0,53,58,23,2,2,9,0,2,0,0,2,5,4,1,1,20,24,1,5,5,0,0,4,10,1,0,0,2,9,38,1,44,53,10,60,0,0,2,0,27,40,0,5,16,209,58,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386609679829566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21684407724952307,0.0,0.08131213756447263,0.0,0.0,0.07432096812010702,0.0,0.0,0.189242615938682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06479385842603534,0.0,0.09044560484438822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085347461019344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148625469721918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06854874453587474,0.32874330730062457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10879309289844484,0.09301575703374942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876197911173888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020404201988731,0.0,0.0,0.10156537254196868,0.0,0.0,0.1002014653128537,0.0,0.05374380001596876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1110650662534632,0.0,0.18122245866429806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11298210346363202,0.1197974072173038,0.0,0.07124445336968864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.221879868540398,0.0,0.09447610787820436,0.0,0.0,0.1752438595967561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710937997903737,0.0,0.0,0.0709499051265511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21415350903905056,0.10711608239965888,0.11275769534214455,0.0,0.0,0.16968053505606104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130414250639106,0.0,0.0,0.10198884725403863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16167781947413262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29475450838654416,0.09280898849060994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11459941260727295,0.0,0.0,0.10685156768756902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16939994236591172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792481190924152,0.0,0.0,0.10835004043809443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799174206166082,0.0,0.18580561175176388,0.0,0.12155274304904445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06197899470941365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12785469247622078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06269304190688639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15476187286472534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368955242304172
autism,thatzwhatido_1,2019/01/26,"Suspicious That My Son is Autistic - Assessment This Week I took my son to go see a pediatrician, and told him that he was having some behavioral issues that I was afraid would effect him when he would start school next year.

I always thought there were some things off about him, but I just thought his language development was just slow. That his delirious tantrums were just a “phase”. 

I explained all the behavior that I thought was strange to the pediatrician, and he said my son definitely has a sensory processing disorder (he is extremely sensitive to taste. Will smell, lick, nibble, then bite the food if it’s suitable. Will only eat goldfish, crackers, whipped cream, ice cream, and his favorite snap peas). 

He said he “may” have autism, and set up an assessment which will be an appointment with my wife and I. The second appointment will be with either my wife or myself with my son. 

Pediatrician said he’ll most likely need behavioral and speech/language therapy. My son speaks and articulates his needs pretty well, but we are his parents so we know him. 

My question is two part for this community. For those of you that enrolled your child in therapy, was it an overall pleasant experience? Did you find that it benefited your child immensely? 

What can we expect the therapy sessions to be like? 

For the autistic adults, do you guys have any experiences you could share if you went to therapy that you particularly enjoyed? Was there ever a time that you suffered from therapy? 

I just want to know in case I need to draw the line somewhere as far as therapy goes. I don’t know how rigorous it will be, and I hate to see my son go through something if it doesn’t really end up benefiting him in the long run.

He’s going to be 4 years old here soon. The behavior I’m most concerned about is his inability to deal with other people. If someone takes his toy, he explodes. If we change the game we’re playing all the sudden, explodes. If we run out of one of the four things he only eats, he explodes. I worry about his nutrition because of this.

We’ve tried starving him out even to force him to eat something like a fruit, but he wouldn’t budge. I just wanted him to have a banana, but he kept throwing his tantrum until he got his snap peas or his goldfish. I felt horrible doing it, it was just the one time, but now I feel like I’ve tried anything. He simply refuses to eat what I introduce to him, and will gag while throwing a big tantrum if I get any food near him with the intent of feeding it to him.

autism,affixed-swordbayonet,2019/01/26,Not sure if quirk or... I'm 13 and autistic and I've kinda noticed something about myself. It's the fact that I often only make friends with nerdish people.  Is this just a personality quirk or can anybody else confirm?

autism,NapalmJusticeSword,2019/01/26,"(20-year-old, male) I need help understanding my condition: So I was diagnosed about two years ago (tail end of high school), and I never really had the opportunity to learn how my condition affects me or how to manage it. whenever I try to do research on this, I only find resources that help parents to prepare their child for adulthood/independent-living; not resources that help recently diagnosed adults to manage their conditions or understand them. I would like some strategies with how I can manage my condition; some examples of how Y'all manage your conditions; some examples of how your condition affects the rest of you; and resources that I can go to to help me accomplish these goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I am terrible with managing my time, because I am fully capable of working hard focusing on something that I don't really want to do. with that, I know that I really need to use a schedule, but the problem is that I hate them and I don't know what to put in one. so I would like to know how I can implement these tools into my life.

 I also know that I have trouble with being myself when there is pressure to do so; which isn' to say that I am uncomfortable with who I am. so I would like some help with finding strategies to help me improve that.

I would like some advice on getting and holding a job because I just don't know how I can do that. lastly, I really need to know how I can manage my emotions because I don't have meltdowns very often, but when I have them I get very hostile and I don't really know what triggers them because I've learned to repress my rage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any info that you can provide is helpful.

autism,Yodamort,2019/01/26,"Does the ""ree"" meme annoy anyone else? For those OOTL:
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reeeeeee?full=1

&gt; ""REEEEEEE"" is an onomatopoeic expression of intense rage or frustration typically associated with the Angry Pepecharacter and used by those who frequent the /r9k/ board on 4chan. The expression is often associated with the Autistic Screeching meme, however it is intended to represent the unique croak produced by several species of frogs when agitated.

I see it constantly. It irritates me as it's associated with the autistic screeching meme. I very rarely have fits, but those less fortunate than myself on other parts of the spectrum do, as I'm sure we're all aware. I find it mocking and insulting to those unable to help themselves.

autism,Spiderpig889,2019/01/26,"Am I autistic? I always felt different from other people and at one point my friends told me that I was behaving kinda autistic. During the past years I have done many tests and always turned out to score quite high in the spectrum. I also suffer from social anxiety (in the past my heart started racing if I just stood 5 metres away from unknown person) but I managed to control it somewhat. I generally lack emotional empathy, however I am usually able to imagine the physical pain someone's going through if I see them getting injured. I get lost in my thoughts very easily and can lead entire conversations with myself (this might be normal though idk). I also have huge problems with following what my teachers tell us during class, even though I have no problem with learning things by reading about them. On top of all of this I am very very introverted and people have told me that I never show any emotions besides laughing. Are these ""quirks"" symptoms for autism or I am completely off track here? I am scared to visit an actual psychologist since my parents think of me as normal and if the test results turn out to be negative I will have made a total fool of myself.

autism,KateinuedAura,2019/01/26,"Looking into getting a service dog (SoCal, US) My husband and I are trying to research getting a service dog for our 7 year old son. Our kiddo is mostly non-verbal and struggles with letting us know when he is in sensory overload. He is an only-child and we think he could really benefit from having a dog, even if that dog isn't a service animal, but it would be awesome if we could get him one. 

Do any of you have a service dog? What are the steps involved in getting one? Costs? We live in Southern California.

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

autism,mario2603,2019/01/26,"If there was a perfect toy for autistic children, what features would it have? What senses would it communicate? Hi, I'm a 18 year old student in my last year of high school, and I'm extremely interested in creating a toy that helps autistic children to understand the world.

My mum works with an autistic child, let's call him Bob, as a teaching assistant, and tells me all about how he behaves, how he learns and what he likes.

She has mentioned things such as a love for moving things like fans, or flowing water, or flashing lights and spontaneous sounds.

I actually intend to go into product design and development as a career, and as a result I'm really interested in designing and making a device that could help Bob and other autistic children to learn.

So, I was hoping I could get some more feedback about how autistic children typically act, and how they go about interacting with objects. What senses would need to be communicated in this toy? Would the product need to be very robust to deal with being bashed around? Are there specific things that need to be taken into consideration?

Thank you so much for your help, I hope I can make something helpful!!

So which cannabis offers the best / longest help  after a single intake for a depressed autistic:)",5.23153153153153,7.385524945945949,5.006486486486487,81.13558558558559,69.81081081081078,8.176576576576577,31.25225225225225,8.841846274778883,2.7794306306306322,322,14,55,6,6,99,56,74,0.201,0.628,0.171,-0.5563,0,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,3,2,6,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,1,0,8,9,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,0,6,3,7,7,6,5,0,3,0,0,4,1,0,2,3,41,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12452175041672305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42873977818316855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5278151287961809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19518976455291148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867000604765084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27383718940594864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4264118588403276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2127168889478008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15016274273739308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20169304161374824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048437161843124,0.16214087009112302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20744719067092854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,sky7dc,2019/01/26,"Am I autistic? So I’m 22, and I recently went to the doctor because I’ve been having skipbeats in my heart. It turned out fine though, and the doctor said I was just able to feel them more than other people. I was driving back from the doctor’s with my dad, and as we were talking about it, he said “Maybe your ability to feel them has something to do with your autism.” I initially thought he was joking, and just laughed. Nobody has ever said anything to me about having autism, and I didn’t even know that was a possibility. Looking back on it though, maybe he’s right. I don’t like people touching me very much, and I’ve always had a hard time reading people. Emotions don’t come super naturally to me, and I struggle a lot with anxiety and ADHD, though I’m fairly intelligent. Am I autistic? Do I just have Aspergers? What does this information mean to me going forward?

autism,kalalalai,2019/01/27,"Advice on helping other family members to accept possible autism. Long post:

Hello all! 

I’m currently taking care of my 2yo niece (turning 3yo this March). her mom is in the ICU because of a heart attack and will undergo surgery and recovery after. Although I’m no expert, they’ve asked me to take care of her since I’m good with kids and have multiple experience in taking care of kids so she will be under my care for quite sometime.

My niece is diagnosed with GDD and possible autism. According to my cousin (my niece’s mom) doctor didn’t officially diagnose my niece yet because the doctor thinks she’s still too young and needs to observe her more but the doctor gave my cousin a heads up that my niece has a high chance of being autistic since she has a lot of symptoms for autism (no eye contact, non-verbal, repetitive movements, flaps hands and arms, sudden bursts of energy, doesn’t react when we call her or to anything we make her do, doesn’t interact with anybody, scratches herself to the point where her skin starts bleeding and etc.)

My niece’s family, including my cousin is in denial about the whole thing. They avoid the topic and they keep on saying “she’s normal to me, she’s just lazy/doesn’t want to be disturbed”

They do take her to therapy as advised by the doctor but also do not follow the routine that was advised by the therapist. 

Her grandma even said that she doesn’t believe in therapy.

And the last time they went to the doctor to have her assessment (2 months ago), he said that her development is very slow, no developments since the last time the doctor saw my niece.

I am slightly worried as well because since the other day, my niece spaces out in the middle of doing something and she lightly but rapidly hits herself in the face for a few seconds then resumes to what she’s doing as in nothing has happen. She has done this about 5 times since the first time I first saw her doing it.

I know it’s not my business because she’s not my child but I truly care for her and I just wanna know if there’s anyway for me to help them out with acceptance or any way for me to help my niece with her development.

If I am overstepping my boundaries, please kindly inform me so I can back off.

autism,sexybloodclot,2019/01/27,"Hi guys! NT here with HF boyfriend. Help me help him with triggers? So we live together, been together almost two years. After this time I’ve come quite familiar with his ticks, stims and triggers.

He can be somewhat explosive if plans change or something goes wrong. He left his smokes in his moms car and she drove away so he threw another pack of smokes on the ground and just fell to the ground almost sobbing.

We’ve gotten into such a heated argument that he hid in a ball in the corner. I got our dogs to come over and coax him out to snuggle and calm him down.

I need to find better ways to help him during these times. I have severe anxiety and OCD but I really don’t think those coping methods are that helpful for him.

I am a special educator with an idea for an app and to teach teenage girls with mild to moderate intellectual or developmental disabilities (specifically autism female) specific grooming skills. The main feature of the app would be short videos demonstrating individual skills filmed in a way that is age-appropriate but also developmentally appropriate and “on trend” like regular beauty tutorials seen on YouTube or Instagram.

autism,Hassaan18,2019/01/27,"Is it normal to feel like this? I have what I assume is high-functioning autism. I'm not entirely sure on the specifics. 

The main symptoms for me is that I struggle with confidence when it comes to social situations. I'm fine in some cases but I become self conscious very quickly and easily. I've never been able to properly hold down a job because I've never managed to adjust to the environment. I'm 21 and still studying and while I do have an idea of the kind of industry I'd like to work in, my parents keep pushing me to apply for something like a retail job. There is a common theme with them being very unfair with me, more than my other siblings, which just further emphasises how rubbish I usually feel. It's just frustrating at this stage. 

Not many people actually know I'm autistic (although would probably not be surprised if I told them) but I'm more inclined to tell people now, if only so it makes my life easier.",3.8389743589743617,5.732384142857146,5.221120879120878,79.24054578754578,72.95604395604396,7.930256410256411,28.616849816849808,8.648137234880735,2.3724845421245417,742,30,134,14,15,248,118,182,0.075,0.821,0.104,0.6506,3,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,2,1,10,9,1,1,8,0,11,2,0,2,3,33,23,12,0,4,9,1,2,3,0,1,2,0,0,1,10,7,0,2,7,0,1,2,5,2,0,0,2,2,15,7,21,18,4,18,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,4,12,92,25,4,0.156151544653883,0.0,0.1523813824510723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09518853227476952,0.172457112866418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13451072911663656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15790982561190348,0.11155469470128793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16498268024153978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17627608708289336,0.0,0.0,0.3099126269807423,0.13879466761845896,0.0,0.16260780450992599,0.08581680522608598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11029445393884173,0.22886327159611006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10423236859308288,0.15831315732497214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2408673953489009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15299535964863614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11876028616736847,0.0,0.0,0.17338781104871304,0.0,0.0,0.2165116394998671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16835777573100627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16290011646047275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755208786842158,0.0,0.1591768351469236,0.0,0.12021308794879358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247028252697642,0.0,0.0,0.1632434986074594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14717098285866131,0.16230124425397924,0.0,0.0,0.13648333268542695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14920949264422034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1719788655121919,0.2576827557043142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11368018426394777,0.0,0.0,0.11092557711543166,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,IfeelloveIfeellove,2019/01/27,"What helps you socialize better? I'd really like to stop being so reclusive and be around people more, but I find it hard to have conversations because of too much noise or too much silence. 

It's also just generally tiring to follow conversations (I ask people to repeat things or I mask by nodding and laughing) and make conversation, especially if there are a lot of people. 

This gives me social anxiety and causes me to avoid being around others, but I'm pretty good at faking it when I need to - it just exhausts me.

My goal is to have better relationships with people instead of hiding behind my work, but when I think about going over to someone's house to get to know them better I panic. 

I prefer doing activities while talking, but people generally want to meet up for coffee where there's loud music or their place where it's too quiet and I find myself making excuses why I can't make it, and then we don't end up meeting up at all.

I find it a lot easier to meet people in the summer when it's warm enough to do things outside, but even that gives me anxiety and it's winter here most of the year.

autism,Bluebunnytaco,2019/01/27,"My fiancé is autistic and I am losing hope for our relationship I would like to first clarify that before we found out that my s/o is autistic, that I have no experience with autism. None of my family is autistic, nor anyone that I have regularly interacted with in my daily life. I am still learning and I apologize if I dont really get it but that's why I came here. 
Before we learned about his autism, idk, it was fine, sometimes he was insensitive to my feelings but it was few and far between. We would get into heated arguments at times, but I never felt outright disrespected and/or broken hearted.
He found out he was autistic at 20y/o
Now when he is dismissive towards my feelings his reactions are far more extreme and far more hurtful. When I tell him that I dont appriciate how he is treating me, he gets offended and explains to me that he is autistic and he cant help it. 
Idk if I can explain this without an example
My parents can be difficult sometimes and my fiancé and I are currently staying with them because we are in between apartment. They had to ask their landlord for permission and while we are only here for a limited amount of time, my parents are doing the best they can. They are invested in our success and asked for complete transparency if we were to stay in their house. This means knowing our income, our plan to move out, and what we are doing to further that goal. My fiancé is vehemently opposed to this. He feels like he is living in a glass house, but I feel that to be fair because it's not our house, its theirs. It's been a very stressful few weeks and I broke down crying because I felt like we hit a thousand roadblocks in our plan. My fiancé holds me until I stop crying and then decides to badmouth my dad who is doing the best he can. He is well aware that I hate when he badmouths my parents, this is a constant that I react badly to every single time he does. Evidently he thought that doing this would cheer me up, but clearly it made everything worse. I told him to leave me alone and he got offended that it didnt cheer me up and that I no longer wanted his comfort. He storms out and told me ""well idk why the fuck you think I would want to touch you after that anyway""
I asked him to leave. I told him that I wanted him to gather his stuff and figure things out elsewhere. He then went on to explain that he cant control his actions because he is autistic and he cant help it.
Hes been fired from every job he has because when someone at work does something he doesnt like he blows up on them or wears a sour face until the managers get sick of his drama. 
Idk what to do. I dont feel comfortable telling him about how I feel and it makes me feel so alone. Is this normal? Is it his autism? I dont know how long I can put up with this. He tells me he wants to go to therapy but he always skips his appointments and is about to be dropped by his therapist. 
I cant do all of this alone. We lost our apartment because I couldnt pay rent with only my income, and he wants me to get a second job when he cant even hold one job.
I love him and I care so much for him but i cant do this anymore",4.310282900096277,4.844120353032661,5.2454110197733845,84.72351607050287,70.19751166407465,7.990061467821968,29.15089239428276,7.957251820313856,1.7637259423831746,2469,89,515,30,42,810,261,643,0.14800000000000002,0.743,0.108,-0.9807,10,3,1,0,0,0,50.0,16,2,8,12,21,29,4,1,12,0,68,7,3,7,3,106,116,49,0,15,13,4,11,4,0,4,2,0,2,0,43,43,0,6,23,1,3,6,20,11,2,4,22,12,102,18,69,85,11,61,0,4,0,2,97,29,1,5,27,366,145,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19982627984885928,0.0,0.0,0.05351347781378818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378110708278749,0.04496906915951093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18037161614574365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053698578138997526,0.23522725075081385,0.0,0.10945106777533277,0.0,0.13498482389894775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07355681484644115,0.06557127922095689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06743084324400021,0.06949938825181477,0.07213237657131309,0.0,0.0,0.14128938305497213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125612896811366,0.0,0.30149691993510525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04247805835585471,0.0,0.1083727699391664,0.0,0.057800280055491274,0.06291034866616083,0.060628470504530414,0.0,0.2276297126720852,0.0459451426130205,0.1235009230982288,0.0,0.0,0.05470451274505847,0.0,0.1410315322325074,0.0,0.05945623196480385,0.16800415723481488,0.0,0.03655049839035787,0.0,0.051436894511071266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06349566572098078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07621108620656625,0.08621515117067789,0.0,0.0,0.06387721269264025,0.0,0.22262532629457885,0.06884828061414243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914618638283312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068936659750999,0.0,0.0,0.13619613232269825,0.0,0.0,0.04542609729885978,0.12568012107450785,0.0,0.05678946155411519,0.05691488526185633,0.0,0.07194967510556248,0.0702051183723149,0.0,0.05804489561655195,0.06085441305742805,0.04292935454420478,0.0,0.0,0.07005559292820487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0683544257856136,0.0472773752659131,0.0,0.04960206676987245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06301297885319562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04358007978234574,0.09782570423116176,0.0,0.0,0.21423556562968926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.064652219402999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041200485187947083,0.0,0.0,0.06904797715610664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449210435379585,0.049511206001222025,0.12721418854768618,0.0,0.0,0.13709797069708754,0.051360358312197,0.05376845712253653,0.0736702000430851,0.0,0.07362287416335413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16863690590495245,0.0,0.07354739647453437,0.07467222406923077,0.042726627469754364,0.041209104099814584,0.0,0.05105725211476109,0.11250409285655727,0.0,0.0,0.18436117199133856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05306487096510404,0.18966704879131965,0.0,0.051587922351806564,0.0,0.11565002644156787,0.0596186948412348,0.11606476288647714,0.0,0.0,0.061995332496446,0.0,0.04682055105136896,0.0,0.06554033094965954,0.18274413187708796,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Leueb,2019/01/28,"What’s the name of that potential autism spectrum disorder where the person is resistant to following instructions? I can’t remember the name for some reason. But it involves someone who is very resistant to following rules and if asked to do anything will do just about anything to stall and get out of it. Tend to be more socially adept than other autistic people and there is question as to whether they are even autistic at all. Does anyone remember what this is called? I’d really love to read about it again.

autism,xxtinagee,2019/01/28,"Substitute teacher - Am I wrong to be upset? To start off, my 7 year old son is on the spectrum and in the first grade. He just started attending his current school last November. The school he previously attended didn’t have the proper amount of help or the program he needs in order to succeed so he was moved schools. That meant he left behind friends he’s known since kindergarten and that was more than enough change he could handle. A new school meant having to make new friends, new teachers and a new schedule. He’s still having trouble adjusting to this change as it’s only been 2 months. 

His current teacher is pregnant so she is leaving for maternity leave at the end of the week. A long-term substitute is to take her place. This past Friday she visited the classroom and my son was not happy about having a new teacher in the classroom. I’m not sure what exactly triggered his anger but he began throwing items and had a breakdown.  His teacher called and told me about the incident and informed me that the substitute stated she no longer was interested in taking the job because of that specific incident. So basically that means the school would be screwed and have to find a new substitute at last minute when she had already committed to long term. I’m upset that my child is being made out to be he’s the reason there will possibly be no substitute and that she specifically stated she doesn’t want to teach the class because of his outburst. 

I understand she may not have not experience with kids on the spectrum but I feel as blame is being placed on my son. She claims “ working with children with children and teaching has been the most fulfilling job” she’s had but can’t deal with a special needs child? I’m not saying my son is an angel either but it’s not like he is violent or aggressive every single day. I can understand her not being comfortable but he does have an aide who assists him in chunks throughout the day. It’s not like she’ll be on her own if or when he does have a breakdown. Are certified substitute teachers not properly trained on this matter? I’m just very disappointed that my kid is the reason she’s turned off to substituting his class. I’ve never personally had this problem before. 

I am having a phone meeting with his teacher and this “substitute” tomorrow so I will ask what is that she wants. Am I in the wrong to feel upset about this? How do I go on about this? 

Tl;dr: Long term substitute teacher no longer wants to teach my son’s classroom because of his outburst.

autism,AmethystVajra,2019/01/28,"How to stop meltdoowns in my relationship As I was single I also had  meltdowns but they only affected me like me thrashing at my  wardrobe or just getting panic attacks and leaving a place  or even just running 
  I am together with my partner since May 2017 since like two months into the relationship  I have started having these meltdowns 
 Mostly because of stuff that is very trivial 
 Like we are in the  grocery store and he asks me what kind of cheese I like  and I start saying completely contrary things like in one moment I say I want mozzzarella  The next moment I say I want gouda  and I say I never said the other thing  when he asks me to decide I start shaking and screaming at him  when he says he’s going to leave the store and we are not going to go shopping at all because he can’t take it I tried to force him to continue to do that what we actually planned to do 
 There have been situations where I run out of the store without paying chasing him all across the Market Square  and screaming  for everyone in the vicinity to hear 

 When I come out of the situations I am totally ashamed of myself and I am very sad because I made him suffer and lose his face as well 
 I am not even intentionally wanting to hurt him I am not angry at him at all it’s like I’m sitting in the car and it’s going really fast and I can’t stop it I know I will  Hurt people and I see how I drive over them but I just can’t stop it until it’s over and I am like awake again 

 These  situations have  happened all that time In different variations and intensities   What I mentioned above was just a simple example 

this year in August I realised that I am abusive and went to a lgbt  place that offers counselling  which is great because the person  Who is counselling me has also a physical disability like me and can help me very much 
 Also I have tried to find a therapy which is not so easy because I’m trans have cptsd and am autistic  so I’m still trying but I have only the counselling at the moment 

 So in the last months things have been getting better and I had the hope we could heal our relationship 
 But now I am moving to another flat and I don’t have the help I need and my partner is carrying a big load  although he is moving to another place to in the near future and needs his energy 
 So I have been having very big meltdowns this past days and these have caused my partner who has cptsd himself to  dissociate and be completely emotionally drained 
 Since Sunday he has distanced himself  and said to me if this behaviour doesn’t change in the new place in the next month  he will leave me forever 
 He knows I’m not meaning to be violent to him but he just can’t take the violence any longer even though I am not physically violent towards him 
 I want to change really and I’m trying my best to do so I know it is my job to realise when my tention goes up and to avoid situations that cause meltdowns  but I often don’t recognise it until it’s too late 
 I just don’t know what to  do 
due to my complex situation having physical disability cptsd am trans and queer and being autistic  not many people are willing to  support me and I don’t really have friends just acquaintances I meet at events 
 Has anyone had set me up situations and can give me any advice ?

autism,scrollbreak,2019/01/28,"Is 'high functioning' a bit of a poor name? What about 'alternate functioning'? 'High functioning' always kind of sounds to me as 'Well, you're almost like us NT folk, you're getting high up towards us...' as if that's the thing to shoot for. When most genuine 'high functioning' people with autism...maybe it'd be better to say they use an alternate way of functioning, rather than describing them as a second best version of NT functioning? 'High functioning' always seems to imply what has to be done is the NT way - but does it really? If an alternate way of doing this works/functions, isn't it just as valid? When it comes to cultures and how different cultures do things different ways, we don't call other cultures 'high functioning' as if if they don't do it our way then they need that name.

Is it fair to compare 'high functioning' people with autism as being similar to different cultures that do things in different ways?",6.487832980972513,7.3989085232558205,6.355856236786469,77.34432346723045,65.51162790697674,10.673150105708244,31.91543340380549,10.637119530657019,3.4787604651162787,734,28,132,19,11,231,91,172,0.022,0.918,0.06,0.7441,4,0,0,1,0,0,21.0,4,0,4,2,7,5,0,0,7,0,16,0,0,2,0,20,21,16,0,6,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,16,5,0,0,1,0,1,1,3,0,1,1,1,2,9,5,27,16,4,20,0,0,0,0,16,10,0,7,4,90,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09008623058465408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14971497482886306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09441196095791032,0.0795660943292693,0.09821769264662003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09186358795718272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749626078917889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3759740965376284,0.0,0.0,0.0787283472303759,0.09206469283737576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04700262288890866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6653654045564396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368395300073104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043952002682000654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038121075736473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670737330019688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12473980766266728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05763342110107748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07154320594322502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08190010121535597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17930480929726522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21643190240656995,0.0777002523702906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4284567453459305,0.0,0.0,0.08088869152695702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,beadmaze,2019/01/29,"Flapping My 4 year old flaps. I've observed that it is a behaviour he does often when he is happy; usually while playing or doing something he finds fulfilling.

I've noticed he is really doing this a lot lately and I'm wondering if he is using it as a happy stim or if it is becoming a coping mechanism.... and if it's maybe a coping mechanism what could be triggering anxiety or whatever is is he is trying to cope with. 

Don't interpret this as me wishing to stop him as flapping is either making him happy or helping him and that's all good.

Mostly I wonder if there's anything I should look at or do if I notice a big increase in the amount he uses this stim.",4.272908496732029,4.895934264705887,6.528333333333332,75.17222222222225,70.32352941176471,9.573856209150328,30.552287581699343,9.725611199111238,3.0293718954248363,524,21,97,12,9,187,80,136,0.029,0.807,0.16399999999999998,0.9538,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,7,0,16,0,0,4,1,31,24,18,0,8,11,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,10,4,0,1,4,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,8,5,8,21,6,11,0,0,1,0,11,3,0,15,7,70,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12200652292912426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13124357120345775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17614000147179115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12733677037104155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13956746721004248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1457675171319367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13376947583768992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5093281453239515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10690025245898496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799074046043833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13392825844474662,0.0,0.0,0.13558948225428302,0.0,0.0,0.1064582912948033,0.0,0.16022534592108714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36315224053410106,0.1673539610141394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021709573832342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227802851172065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13333762251023304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10828067546093584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2754897773522276,0.17565154095962598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18340128386192225,0.0,0.3459120080214703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10270389769712852

autism,khaleesibrink,2019/01/29,"Teeth grinding toddler Hi all! My 2 year old stims with hand flaps and teeth clenching/grinding, his dentist recently noticed wear on his molars and is concerned he will damage his teeth, said we needed to “break his habit” which I explained was not a habit but stimming. I understand it’s harmful to stop his stimming and I don’t want to make him uncomfortable in any way, however I don’t want to compromise his dental health as his dentist stressed regardless of stim or not it was still negatively impacting his teeth. Does anyone have any ideas for an alternative stim that I could attempt to redirect him to or have any experience with something similar? He’s never been keen on teething toys or pacis, and has never been a kid that puts everything in his mouth, so I don’t think giving him an alternative to chew on would benefit, as he has a very limited diet and doesn’t put non edible objects in his mouth. Would love any advice, thanks in advance.

I posted a video which is more aimed at parents after a viewer asked this very question. I don't have kids myself however I give some advice based on the autism aspect &amp; how I would personally think I would approach the subject.  Mainly I made the video in order to help others so I hope that it does.

What advice would you give to people out there or have you been through this situation before, what did you do?

autism,lil_baby_aidy,2019/01/29,"[Question] I'm planning on telling my psychiatrist that I think I have high functioning autism. I had a psychiatrist a while back, he provided me with basic medication for depression and anxiety. This was before I suspected that I might be autistic. He retired and I didn't have a psychiatrist again for a long time.

I finally have a new appointment, and in the time between I've learned a lot about myself and autism. One thing I've learned is it's hard to diagnose in adults. I'm just not sure how to bring this up to him or go about it. I mainly just want an answer.

Before, me and everyone who knows me is aware of my debilitating social anxiety. Throughout my entire first year of college, not counting teachers, there may have been 5-6 people I ever had a conversation with. And only 2 where I had multiple conversations with. I also from birth have never been able to maintain eye contact, with anybody. I try so hard but my entire life I haven't been able to do it.

Basically after that I realized I have the majority of the symptoms of HFA, and I just want to make sure I get the proper diagnosis from a psychiatrist. For anybody who was diagnosed as an adult, do you guys have any tips on how I should go about this/ bring it up?

autism,gwh0205,2019/01/29,Noise at work Been hiding my autism from my employer for a long time. I drive them crazy with my quirks but I do a good job so they put up with me. We recently changed out our equipment and I have run into a problem. The machines regularly alarm with a sound in that bad pitch range that throws me for a loop. Obviously I can't go around wearing head phones as I'm the facility social worker. If I start wearing my ear plugs people are gonna start asking questions. Namely my boss. I love my job so I have no idea what I am gonna do. Eventually she is gonna start putting the pieces together and figure out what I am. Then I am really screwed.

I've done this because I find it hard to sift through the varying culturally biased comments in general autism communities and because several others reported they were interested over a short period of time when I asked. However, I have no experience moderating, so if you have experience and would like to lend a hand, please PM me.

autism,gooeyzlass,2019/01/29,"Advice on starting school again. In six days I'm starting Year 10. I'm very nervous. School has always been really difficult for me - half way through last year I stopped going altogether because I couldn't go without shutting down/freaking out, which usually ended in having to be taken home or being unable to do anything. I hadn't been diagnosed at that point, and I didn't understand what was wrong at all. I was misdiagnosed with a bunch of things - OCD, various personality disorders, etc. None of these felt right but I spent a lot of time in therapy &amp; taking meds in an attempt to improve things. They only really got worse and I was a huge mess. I'd only see my friends every couple months, and barely even spoke to my family. 
Recently, it was my birthday, and I had two people over, as my parents were pushing for me to do something social. It was not great. In total, I'd say there was about one and a half to two hours of complete silence. I've never been good or even really competent at communicating with people, but my skills had declined further in the time I'd been away from school. I kept making bizarre and weak attempts at talking to them. They were confused. It was confusing to me, too. I didn't understand how I was expected to respond to or interpret the signals they were sending. 
I'm starting school again in under a week, and I'm desperate to not screw up socially or academically this time. My parents have talked to my teachers a bit about some things that might help me feel more comfortable (headphones, taking work to the library/somewhere quiet, etc), but based on my recent social failures/confusions, I'm completely terrified of interacting with my peers. I can't figure out how to plan for it. I'm not sure how to script interactions/exchanges which are almost always entirely unpredictable. Knowing that I have autism has helped in terms of understanding why I have the problems I do, but I am still lost on how to address them. 

Does anyone have any advice? No matter how small, I will be incredibly grateful. I lot of obvious things regarding talking and engaging/interacting with people my age seems to really go over my head. I'm very panicked.

Sorry that this post is so long. It's my first &amp; likely last post. It's also the only time I've written out or spoken any of this. I also apologise for this post likely being difficult to read or confusing/unclear in any way. I am not good at this kind of writing.

autism,Whydidideletemyaccou,2019/01/29,"Anyone have an article discussing possible links to autism and Neanderthal/other primial man DNA? I had stumbled upon this rather odd thought while partaking of a particular plant that is allowed in certain states, so excuse any typing errors and grammar mistakes. After thinking about it, I realized there would probably be some various effects while mixing two different species. One would probably be brain chemistry differences. The  brain is highly complex and it appears brains that even within the past 100-200 years American's brain chemistry and organization has already appeared to change slightly in that small time period. The changes between a homosapien and a Neanderthal/early man's brain chemistry would be even more drastic than that. Essentially, you would be combining two different brain with different structures/brain anatomy in different areas. There's no way that this wouldn't cause conflict. The brain isn't completely made by one gene. It's mades of thousands and thousands of genes. Mixing a certain combination of genes could creates deficits in neural pathways, potentially causing several.

autism,OliveOilBerryOil,2019/01/30,"I’m worried I’m mildly autistic but also don’t want diagnosis I feel like a positive diagnosis would take a toll on my self esteem. I don’t want to feel inherently “inferior” to my peers. 
But at the same time I feel like a negative diagnosis would make me feel better, so I’m in a kind of “if I’m not sick then say so and if I am sick tell me I’m not” situation. 

It’s worrying me now because I am struggling again to make and keep friends in Uni (I’m 17) and I’m clueless as to what I’m doing wrong. Should I seek diagnosis or live life as usual? Does it make a difference either way this late? Or would it inform my approach? I may very well not be autistic and just self diagnosing.

autism,Totalityclause,2019/01/30,"How to people ""participate"" in society? This is a super vague and interpretable question, but how do people ""participate"" in society?

 
Like, I'll show up, do my job, talk to people when I need to, but things like parties? Not a party party, but like, gender reveal parties, or awards celebrations, etc. The idea of gathering around to celebrate a ""50/50"" chance of meaningless gender, or to celebrate someone celebrating you with an award... I don't get it. 


I seems I've gravitated to gatherings as examples, but things like, getting excited (or any emotion) for your birthday, or getting drunk w/ friends cuz you got your dream job, or... Having a dream job. (Maybe this is more about celebrations? Hmm) I don't understand the motivation to somehow gather a lot of people to celebrate, get them to care enough about you, or an individual, to take time out of their day, do nothing of consequence, then go to bed. I feel like a hipster saying they don't do things just because other people do, and I guess it's similar, but on a deep, unfathomably confusing level 😣",6.297325627740136,7.553607357512956,7.196891191709845,69.9070864886409,66.09844559585493,10.912554802710245,34.0171383021124,10.891193690592663,4.1110074930251095,832,37,141,24,13,278,113,193,0.08,0.623,0.297,0.9952,3,0,0,0,0,0,48.0,0,5,3,4,8,12,0,1,11,0,11,1,0,4,0,34,24,19,0,1,13,0,1,5,1,0,0,1,1,0,8,5,1,0,8,4,0,1,4,1,0,0,1,2,15,11,27,23,4,13,0,0,0,0,15,8,0,12,9,97,23,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09093095495219693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903492133535347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08151157499594287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13633160852084086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623527394177406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15041165810846094,0.0,0.13816359707415293,0.1491278492239069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761044784158637,0.09552620096132856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330807006971864,0.0,0.27944279588421106,0.0,0.07599345776074637,0.0,0.10694430014673156,0.0,0.1473024225162535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15094824081090613,0.0,0.0,0.3980752575858269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32663258344107315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113679923423468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13433494067518276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914816320547043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128303388216759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.463506588420887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14979168161395784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633573334059793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12172934115246742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11329649698010105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10053722655688382,0.1074752525055496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.266503410585926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07797043729378418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392022904524477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,melons366,2019/01/30,"Dealing with violence in an autistic adult I’m a caretaker for two autistic adult men, one of whom has the mental age of a 8-10 year old and has frequent meltdowns. He’s been violent towards people a few times in the past and today he was violent towards me. 
We follow a strict daily schedule and as we were completing a chore today, he suddenly told me to “shut up” and before I could say or do anything, he threw something at me and then came up to me and started hitting me. I kept my calm the entire time and was eventually able to walk out and lock myself in the bathroom (with the help of his mother distracting him). The entire incident lasted no more than 5 minutes. I am not physically injured as his hits were not that hard but I am a little shaken up.

My question is, what can be done in these moments? Hopefully this doesn’t happen again but if it does, what should I do when the rage is directed towards me?",6.35409836065574,5.8447660765027285,7.151371584699457,76.38509016393445,65.83060109289617,9.942950819672133,34.69344262295082,9.3871,3.1139403278688533,724,30,138,12,10,242,121,183,0.093,0.853,0.054000000000000006,-0.7959999999999999,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,2,0,0,0,2,6,3,1,14,0,19,1,0,0,0,25,30,16,0,4,6,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,3,7,14,0,1,1,0,0,4,4,4,0,2,10,2,19,2,24,15,2,35,0,0,0,0,19,14,0,4,17,105,26,0,0.1917552398335112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15779822377767036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16316958565755293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21931691019076766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010517206693275,0.0,0.0,0.15310095574118346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19769123232402416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16780630259406354,0.196232186346946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1695685253033693,0.0,0.1717750303232672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128529495233424,0.0,0.0,0.19045622011494898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563061136952426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19218912622220416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932441804384382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2012148675019668,0.0,0.12993831317580004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830520739787379,0.13293893906419108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21480975386177814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15249146320737392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14762255193723867,0.0,0.0,0.1357253457129622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22362804480342124,0.0,0.3635230920209728,0.1832303491511924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873170061912312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12348408751028772

autism,lilleskovmaar,2019/01/30,"Does anyone else here have autistic parents? My dad is autistic. This made things really interesting when I was a child. From a young age, he had some quirks about him that I read as being a unique sense or humour. For example, when he would take figurative speech literally, I thought that was his way of joking because I didn't find it difficult to understand. In my early adolescence, around age 11 or 12, I noticed that he seemed to have a lot of trouble reading emotions. On my mom's birthday one year, she wanted to go somewhere to eat. I can't remember where, but my dad was adamant on not going because he didn't like it. It upset my mom but he really didn't seem to understand why or how he could resolve the issue, so I walked to the store and bought her some chocolates. It's weird being a kid but having more empathy than your dad... I was diagnosed with Asperger's at age 12, but I've had that diagnosis removed as an adult because my doctors don't think I actually have it. Nowadays, my relationship with him is admittedly strained because he can't understand my emotions. I'm a trans woman who's on estrogen and the recent influx of complex emotions has been impossible for him to grasp. He's always had trouble but now that I'm an adult and a girl, I think he just doesn't know how to relate. I'm not really sure how to handle it because he just seems so unfeeling. I can get frustrated but my older sister has to remind me that he's on the spectrum so he has difficulties in certain areas.",6.253732727990522,6.129390251677855,7.2041887090406656,74.6339222266088,65.94630872483222,10.367469403868931,34.307935254638764,10.056822442137396,3.3645082510856703,1197,50,227,25,17,403,160,298,0.096,0.8590000000000001,0.045,-0.9479,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,0,1,15,14,1,2,13,0,29,4,0,4,2,48,50,22,0,3,13,7,0,1,0,1,3,1,0,6,15,6,1,0,17,3,2,4,9,7,0,1,14,1,28,7,30,32,4,26,0,0,0,0,35,10,0,9,12,147,43,3,0.0,0.0,0.1096525246701549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934971021775704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856857423222277,0.11513173935809227,0.0,0.10002912296735668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34248484676027924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971471305832339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404862303724846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11501085644539726,0.09833181127918302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497796443763295,0.09386696160785396,0.3791882098766939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10270003656139508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05870633902696125,0.0,0.12771981273711575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11728039450374013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06175314333552993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05489611029711944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09552913474029814,0.0,0.10632295840283484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263202244506149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279288730233626,0.0,0.0,0.07614177472253156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476859654838615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22479182685663668,0.0,0.2159526607551434,0.0,0.1109473810294628,0.12063850153382605,0.12728821364206375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30688000878089505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1059031593562416,0.0,0.08448487624672119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07465064909710116,0.14399855789876398,0.0,0.08920566019818292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35092936273155834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06627608656745204,0.08919050826204726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013923915819241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07982123134436392,0.0,0.0,0.07235970164015335

Not sure if this is allowed, remove if it is not. 

My girlfriend is a Behavior Therapist and wanted to help spread information to those uninformed about Autism. She is trying to target the Spanish speaking community.  Would appreciate it if you guys check it out.  New to this whole YouTube thing, so the video quality inst the greatest yet, but we are learning and getting better as we go.

autism,damage_control,2019/01/30,"A few questions from a parent Our 11-year-old high-functioning son goes through periods of difficult behavior (lots of anger/yelling/slamming doors, rudeness, disruption at school, with occasional incidents at home of hitting, biting, and attempts to leave the house). These periods typically last 1-2 weeks and often seem triggered by a significant change of schedule (days off from school) and/or stress. He takes generic ritilin primarily for school. Once he comes out of these episodes, his behavior is generally very good. He has a therapy session once per week but he does not seem to be applying much of anything from that.

1. Is there a name for these kind of extended periods of such behavior? My understanding is that a ""meltdown"" is not such an extended thing.  

2. I assume this kind of thing is pretty common. Is it? Are there some known tactics to help bring cut these episodes short?  

3. We worry about what happens if he still has extreme aggression when he's older and bigger than us. Any tips?

autism,SwimmingChipmunks,2019/01/30,"Can I get some basic mom advice? I have a teen that was diagnosed with ASD. We used to have issues when he was little (the mall, lights, sounds, etc... all sensory for the most part), but then life seemed to be progressing normally until high school. We are attempting to do online school now to help with those issues, but this transition has been something else. I'm on the verge of re-enrolling him even though he's begging me not to. 

I obviously want to be sensitive to his needs, but I also want him reaching his true potential. He's so smart academically, but struggles with other details. I've committed to giving him 2 more weeks, but that's it. If things don't improve by then, I'm re-enrolling him.

autism,starmoonla,2019/01/30,"How can I help my autistic brother? Hello! 17f here. My 3 year old brother was diagnosed this past june. He is non verbal and I think would be considered lower functioning. He had an op therapist that came to the house over the summer a handful of times and it seemed promising, but the scheduling was really inconsistent and just not the best experience. Since then he has started preschool early in a special ed class, and goes for 3 hours in the morning on week days. I know these are all steps in the right direction, but I constantly find myself anxious feeling like we should be doing more.

I watch him after school while my parents work, I have since he was born. He doesn't do much other than watch TV and run around playing with his favorite toy. Is the constant stimulation from the TV bad for him? It's the only thing that'll make him stay still and focus for a bit. He has certain cartoons that he's fascinated with and gets upset when they go off. Are there certain activities we should be doing or additional help we should be seeking to better help him? Or am I getting ahead of myself? I know my parents are doing the best they know how to do. But none of us have dealt with this disorder head on before and idk I'm just worried that a lack of proactivness on their end will be detrimental to his development. It makes me apprehensive when I think about moving out for college.",5.112892772977219,6.4327648022388075,5.497619795758052,80.770396700707,68.88805970149254,8.477926158680281,29.4037706205813,8.841846274778883,2.2893328358208955,1109,41,209,19,19,354,166,268,0.11,0.755,0.135,0.736,3,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,4,0,3,5,11,12,0,2,15,0,32,3,2,5,3,47,47,19,0,5,8,4,2,1,0,6,1,0,0,0,12,18,0,0,8,4,0,5,3,3,0,0,5,4,29,9,30,31,8,40,0,0,2,0,28,11,0,3,24,149,41,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14459418469814275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11393974494486303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686771965207044,0.0,0.0,0.10891150596536436,0.0,0.2686387762517049,0.11319825366868284,0.13973378209259305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463884024482194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2766271062321277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08254405520624232,0.0,0.0,0.12990887688196134,0.0,0.0,0.14668957189678405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336265239901873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12520043802773936,0.0,0.0,0.06471644704141426,0.0914372929471822,0.0,0.0,0.11698209106014205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13374075663067633,0.0,0.07274063020837256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13135640534324192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573704069375816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260460382527145,0.14768523228750502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21102266597368868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06253027738491773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17087090143798955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603491684503624,0.09408862321689868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343057540653015,0.0,0.0,0.09734345206944922,0.0,0.0,0.2842392624494146,0.0,0.12218255606132805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08199475764884763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10930420875139886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12953442914954605,0.0,0.11651883268896662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21175210654475604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09059318095157627,0.13642211772720916,0.10221433348067832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14860822361014786,0.08503199534067593,0.1640238209902884,0.0,0.0,0.07463298701617799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15395825066659086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10266721791134123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931794788078268,0.12998177979856995,0.0,0.09092162832947877,0.0,0.0,0.08242245562680782

autism,Bzzzzerk9,2019/01/30,"Help/ideas for getting ASD 8 year old eating My ASD stepdaughter is having issues with losing weight. She has a very limited diet as she is picky regarding textures and the way foods look. She does not like to try new foods although we have been doing the “no thank you” bite when we can. She also is concerned about getting fat. 
She is on Methylphenidate to help her focus so that suppresses her appetite.  She doesn’t eat during the school day so was really only eating dinner at her moms. The school is now prompting her at lunch to stay on task and eat. 

When we have her we push dinners with chicken or protein as it seems to be cereal, toast, or Mac &amp; cheese at her moms home. 
The doc has shown concern on weight loss so she is getting Pediasure now too. We had her 10 lbs above her current weight last summer with every other week visitation. 

She does well with rewards based systems. I was thinking of applying that to her food. Stickers if she eats a full meal and stickers if she eats something new. Stickers can be traded in for a prize. Has anyone successfully done this? Thoughts?

I wish we could get her in with a feeding specialist. Mom says they can’t get into one unless she is anorexic. Where we live there are feeding specialists for ASD kids. 

Any other suggestions would be welcome. Thank you!",3.6931639601885777,6.0718759277108445,3.844222105814562,86.78387113672079,74.86345381526105,6.418788196263312,25.685524707525754,7.423996415210882,1.3511859961585468,1042,37,192,13,23,321,154,249,0.043,0.858,0.098,0.9366,1,0,2,0,0,0,26.0,7,2,1,6,14,10,0,0,9,0,29,20,1,0,0,30,41,17,0,5,6,3,3,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,6,16,20,2,3,0,1,2,4,2,1,1,6,5,34,8,27,30,1,29,0,2,1,0,40,11,0,5,14,129,40,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07173504277652877,0.0,0.09719260221646196,0.0,0.06100076406957825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06272206138930549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162013304882253,0.0,0.0,0.05785068025473888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15699849370678925,0.09179678354450076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5507282025426088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557821026873353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3254057933910872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343292236350839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12025136622761977,0.0,0.08997890375292987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126318401983858,0.0,0.09362608620188834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07311949559689357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04382410185926317,0.0,0.07920893539575223,0.0,0.07532749307886648,0.10035413281302516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31517538976061343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17327043297075936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412766571002901,0.0,0.06078472360108882,0.06822278002324678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057465707196677325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133501440829951,0.0,0.1815674023765146,0.0,0.08166177099856207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06905735342779266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09561091095648387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651719877933618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05747772870233369,0.0,0.07121375117087525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06090209733238396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07401394239411087,0.0,0.07120165523203767,0.07195392062084494,0.3277003727662814,0.0806533045237456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031534278216852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06372206981576925,0.0,0.0,0.05776545766213183
autism,puppyribbons,2019/01/30,"Is it an autistic thing to look younger than you are? A bit of a weird question but I was wondering if there's any evidence behind this or if it's just sort of a coincidence. I heard someone mention that autistic people tend to have a bit of a baby face, which surprised me at first but I realized it's kind of true. I know that personally, I (17F), get mistaken for around 13 but the idea never crossed my mind.

autism,A_Girl_In_Pearls,2019/01/31,"My son hits himself. How can I help? First time posting ever on reddit, so please be kind.

So my son is 3 years old and was recently diagnosed with autism. He is nonverbal (so far, anyway) and has other difficulties in core areas. I'm a new parent in general, so this is all new territory for me, but especially so with autism. So please, forgive me if I use a term wrong or say anything offensive, I'm still learning.

Like the title says, my son hits himself (slapping himself, punching his eyes, banging his head against things, etc.) and I honestly have no clue how to react when he does this. He is starting ABA soon, and receives special education services, but so far no one has offered advice on how to handle this self-abuse. I think that it is overstimulation, but in other instances I think it is just to get a reaction from us. I just want to know what to do and how to handle this behavior. I love him, and it pains me every time he hurts himself. I know that maybe I can't stop it, but some tips to lessen it would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you everyone in advance.

autism,anroger98,2019/01/31,"I suspect the boy I nanny is autistic and want to address this with his parents but don’t know how or if I should.. I’m a nanny to a beautiful 1.5 year old baby boy. I noticed within my first week working with him that’s he’s a little “different”. I’m not a mom, but I have nannied/babysat at least 50 children. I’ve noticed he shows signs of autism, which I recognized from encountering people with autism. His parents don’t seem to think anything of his developmental delays, or the signs of autism. My question is, should I somehow bring this up to his mom (who I’ve befriended over these past few months)? 

He walks on his tippy toes sometimes, can barely say ba-ba, he doesn’t make eye contact, he chooses to play alone, he doesn’t interact with much at all, he instantly calms when I hold him tight and rock him, and loud noises overwhelm him at times. I know that just because he shows signs, this does not mean he is autistic. He’s not even 2. But I know that catching it early and learning how to teach him and deal with him if he is autistic is the best thing for him. Because if he is, they don’t even seem to think so and it could see it furthering his delays :( 

I don’t know what to do because I’m not his parent..

autism,Millenial_ardvark,2019/01/31,"Discovered I’m mildly autistic, is there something/ somewhere that can help me develop my social skills and connect with others I’m a 20 year old girl and what I thought was just social anxiety and depression turns out to be a result of mild autism which I was diagnosed for a few weeks ago. I didn’t even realise but then I discovered I have a lot of social flaws like I have always found it difficult to form close knit long term connections, my social skills have always been rusty, I’ve never felt like I have a solid sense of identity an personality and have masked and mirrored others since I was 12. It’s real lonely and all I want to do is develop in terms of identity and socially and find a sense of identity and connect with others and just be outgoing, as I don’t really have friends and I’m deeply afraid of judgment due to constant rejection from others in the past- like literally it feels like a knife to the gut if a social situation turns awkward or just doesn’t go to plan. Is there anywhere or anything for people mildly autistic like me which is a safe space to and something that can help me with my desires to become more socially able and make friends where I don’t have to be scared of rejection and judgment, bc I’m only really afraid of this in college or anywhere where people don’t understand my situation.

autism,sears_wish_book,2019/01/31,"CBD Oil I know there is a great deal of information concerning the use of CBD oil in children with Autism.

I am considering beginning a CBD oil treatment for my 10 year old who has not responded well to medical/behavioral interventions (discussion with Developmental Pediatrician has taken place, so I am not jumping in totally blind).

However, the information concerning the best type to buy is overwhelming.

Could you please share your own experiences as well as specific brands and dose information?

autism,ashlynmorris,2019/01/31,"weighted blanket/body pillows for sleep issues hi friends. i am having a really hard time with sleep, only getting about 4 hours a night and sometimes i skip nights of sleep altogether. when i do sleep i’ll usually have a nightmare or sleep paralysis that horrifies me. i think it could be linked to environmental insecurity/not feeling safe or comforted in my bed and room, possibly from my pillows and blankets? 
Does anyone on here have one of those pregnancy pillows that wraps around and hugs you? Or does anyone know anything about the weighted blankets? Do they help/are they worth the cost? 
if you think they help, do you have a recommendation for something temporary until it comes? 
if you don’t think they help, let me know why, let me know what you find helps best with these issues for your experiences.

autism,Meowely,2019/01/31,"14 year old brother with autism - the future? Hello. I have a 14 year old brother who has autism. He has big problems in school and even though he goes to a class with extremely few students, teachers seem to not care enough to understand his needs. The only classes he passes is music and sports. He has huge trouble with writing assignments. Last week he got his report card and he was failing EVERY class, even the music and the sports. My mother asking the teachers how he could fail sports and apparently they had a writing test on something. It pisses me off that they didn't contact my mom about it. And now I am worried about how his future will look. :((( He was always unmotivated to go to school, but after him seeing his report card he has almost lost all motivation to keep going to school. ""Why should I even go to school when I am failing even in things that I like?"".  He might not even go to high school since school is not fitted for people with different needs. I am sure that if he had a teacher who cared about him and his learning style, he would be fine. But he can't even change schools now, because there is no other school that has this few students and is as close to home as this one.   


I would like to hear stories of people with autism that maybe have been in a similar situation. How does your/their life look now? What kind of jobs did you/they have in the future? What do you/they enjoy doing?

autism,Grendelbeans,2019/02/01,"Advice about haircuts. Looking for advice from parents or folks on the spectrum who have been through this and might have some suggestions ...  my 7 year old HATES having his hair or face touched. Brushing and washing his hair is difficult. Cutting his hair is almost impossible. We schedule time at a salon where the stylist is trained for this and it’s still AWFUL. Screaming, crying, kicking, won’t be still, and sometimes he gets so upset he makes himself sick. It’s so bad that I will start crying when he has to go in for a haircut. He hasn’t had a trim since last summer so I’ve made an appointment for next weekend. I am dreading it, but his hair is fine and tangles really easily when it gets long, and it’s become a daily traumatic event to get it tangle free for school.   Has anyone experienced this and do you have any suggestions?

autism,Dragondave17,2019/02/01,"Autist issues compounded/clouded by bullying? First-time poster here (actually in a really bad way too atm with physical &amp; emotional pain, but that aside).  


We know that people with autism are more prone to bullying &amp; also are more receptive to being affected by it. Straight away that promotes a conflict with NTs. If you approach a NT or elder with an issue about bullying, from their experience as a NT, bullying is not a big problem or they will doubt you that it even exists. This leads to more issues.

So maybe we have some people with autism that have issues that ""aren't autism"" but stem from bullying and other negative life experiences, and that just confuses what autism is and isn't? Not that two people with autism are the same but..  


Just reading through some of these threads, I feel like I can relate to all of them, even the unpopular ""this isn't autism it's just offensive"" or the wild ""is this autism?"" ones. So I don't know, exactly what parts of are autistic and what is from life experience.  


Sorry if I've messed up my first post. I came here because it's pointless trying to talk to a stranger about issues related to it, that'll just make me feel worse since they don't understand. I don't know if I fit in anywhere though.",6.115140056022407,6.817360457983196,6.116487394957982,79.47066946778712,66.26890756302521,10.044145658263307,30.57254901960784,10.047579312681364,2.8634108683473385,991,35,190,22,15,313,128,238,0.228,0.7240000000000001,0.049,-0.9941,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,2,2,4,3,15,8,1,2,10,0,20,3,0,3,2,46,28,18,0,4,15,0,2,1,0,2,3,0,0,0,22,13,0,1,6,1,1,3,9,7,0,3,1,2,16,1,29,24,8,13,0,0,0,0,9,7,0,10,2,136,38,3,0.0,0.0,0.11100134959737132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09096399680699367,0.0,0.24649117684988345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686971109516297,0.0,0.09497458056586924,0.06933954383886089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300970692318683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12795085559083474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15025856979516414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3338012393375873,0.0,0.0,0.11502851251027935,0.08126138158473277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19350747573142985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5936152455398314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18753828804425432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1606867327673386,0.05557138195364273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759274748624742,0.0,0.11427485616001455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707838720872086,0.0,0.12103557555361545,0.0,0.0,0.1231776774641308,0.0,0.2365750047819145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10893885648174896,0.0,0.0,0.10884118958537402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11377848451097612,0.0,0.07286969106904237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09409327516533113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273312405862596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914260947978508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117565404401141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722722358360133,0.0,0.11111497741587628,0.11841537010881913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902876319368266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11591862685786147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Hervit123,2019/02/01,"I think I may be on the autistic spectrum... how to know for sure? Ever since I can remember, I have always been 'different'. I know I used to display certain behaviours that were questioned by other people when I was a kid back in the 90's, and I feel that there wasn't as much general understanding of autism as there is today, and my behaviours were just shrugged off as being 'odd' rather than probed.

For example, I would only eat certain things (there was a time where I would only eat cabbage  or cheese sandwiches), I would sit in my room reading history and science books whilst the other kids were playing out, I would go to birthday parties and spend the whole time fascinated by the wallpaper or the paintings rather than joining in the fun, I would find it very difficult to make friends and was bullied throughout middle school and secondary school, and would often eat my lunch alone, or spend it with my favourite teacher. There are many others but I can only list a few.

Anyway, I feel like I have definitely 'improved' as I have got older, and I would consider myself more normal these days in my early twenties...but I still find myself struggling with life and my ability to connect to the world, I feel like I am going along but at the same time completely lost. I dropped out of college (sixth form) twice because I couldn't cope with leaving my bubble for the outside world every day and mixing with other people, even though my grades were great.

I have no friends, I live back at my mums house as I found it hard to cope at uni and am on a gap year, I am extremely isolated and spend my free time either reading, playing video games or playing my piano (which I self taught myself very quickly, I don't know if that is also some sign). I guess I feel kinda hopeless, like I am different but I don't know why I can't cope. 

As I suggest, I do wonder if perhaps I have been undiagnosed with being on the autism spectrum. It's not like I really want to be labelled, but at the same time, if I were to be able to connect my ways to a condition then at least I would have a grounded understanding and be able to refer to others with the same and perhaps access support at uni etc.

autism,alltheaubrey,2019/02/01,"How much info is my right to share? Hi all, first time poster here. I am a first time mom of a wonderful two year old boy with autism. He is an absolute joy and brings so much happiness to everyone and I'm so happy and proud to be his mom. I have always loved sharing my life online (instagram, etc.) and documenting our life, but as he gets older and his learning delays become more apparent in comparison to kids his age, I've been hesitant to share. NOT because I'm embarrassed, but because I can't decide how much about his disability is my right to share. We don't know how growing up in the social media spotlight will affect children, and I'm hesitant to tell people about his diagnosis or what he is delayed on or the therapies we're working with, because I don't want him to grow up and be upset that I shared. I hope to raise him in a way where he's proud of who he is and doesn't feel embarrassment or shame surrounding any aspect of autism, but I simply don't know who he'll be or what he'll wish to share. I'm kind of rambling, but I'm curious to hear primarily from autistic teens/adults about your perspective on this, and I'm happy to hear from parents of autistic children as to how you've navigated this area of your child's life with respect to their boundaries that they can't communicate yet.

I'm a 27yo male and wondering if I have Asperger-syndrome or not.
Here are a few things about me:
- I like to do things in a certain way (e.g. drying myself with a towel after taking a bath, I realized I've been using the same pattern for over 20 years)
- I like to do things at certain time (watching a movie at exactly 6pm, taking a walk exactly at 8pm)
-I prefer to do things the same way over and over again, I have habits that haven't changed in 20 years
- I'm fascinated by numbers, and know an insane amount of numbers about vehicles (power, torque, weight, etc)
- I hate social events, being in a crowd gives me discomfort
- I like to do tasks alone, in peace, quietly
- I have a very hard time making new friends/ facing new situations feel like an execution for me
- I am very-very introverted, in general",5.336946107784435,5.418776257485028,6.397251497005987,78.94198502994014,67.86227544910179,9.79377245508982,29.87365269461077,9.642632912329526,2.547479520958084,653,22,132,13,10,219,102,167,0.08,0.792,0.129,0.785,2,1,0,0,0,0,34.0,0,1,0,1,4,9,1,1,13,0,14,2,1,2,4,22,26,5,0,2,3,0,3,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,6,4,1,0,6,1,0,1,2,2,0,0,1,5,15,7,23,24,5,23,0,0,1,0,7,11,0,3,13,83,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647978273239998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16832530323558093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774581644659829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804546302728248,0.1136736321835747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12293384893903808,0.0,0.0,0.152640083349876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14253809935498907,0.1570956697470891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874468616364466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31094725238184484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10621222137535097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3073535039251579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17885482863373414,0.0,0.16220033642768775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23927323807235776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228426039591894,0.1019561214884431,0.0,0.0,0.1855654829969453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13742650226159173,0.0,0.26257733814266776,0.0,0.2526002601324477,0.0,0.1937623480252479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725562298883245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20493301152300766
autism,Quick_Bath,2019/02/01,"What have been your experiences with CBT and mindfulness? 

I've been very avoidant of any CBT, I was supposed to get it with my last therapist but I had to leave therapy with them. I'm not sure if I want to pursue CBT with my next therapist due to recent experiences.

I've been going to a recovery college where they use a lot of mindfulness, it's also muddied a bit with other techniques based around behaviour modification and positive affirmations. I'm finding it just too...fluffy.

For me it's all generally hard to do, mindfulness meditation is uncomfortable and keeping diaries of emotions etc. isn't useful as I'm already very conscious of my emotions. I think many of my struggles are more due to autism and ADHD than my depression eg. if I struggle to do a task then behavioural modification like rewarding myself won't work, as the difficulty is due to executive dysfunction not lack of motivation due to depression. 

Am I just being put off by the muddiness of what I've experienced so far, or is CBT like this in general so possibly not for me?

autism,Frantxi,2019/02/01,"I just started a job as a Montessori guide, need some tips to help a student Hi all,  


My background : I am an environmental engineer in a foreign country, and as a foreigner I was able to be hired as a teacher to teach in my language but also science in English. I am not trained in the Montessori method yet.  
I have a 9 year old autistic student, let's call him K, he cannot read and write, and he sometimes moves his arms in a very erratic way. Before joining the school a year and a half ago, he was actually tied to a chair in a public school ! The kid has some anger problems (could be from how he used to be treated...), sometimes hitting other kids, but fundamentally he is a good kid and the other kids at the school don't resent him. He has many friends.  
We managed to do some additions and subtractions, and I am trying to help him figure out how to read with the B A BA method.  
Could anyone point to me people I should listen to ? Or are you autistic and you had similar behaviors ? How did you overcome them ? Were there some games that helped you ? I am thinking more sensory games than computer games but perhaps you have a different opinion.  


Thanks

He was diagnosed with autism last year, and is mostly non verbal. He is incredibly smart and I want to get something that would keep his attention. I guess I was wondering if I should stick to sensory items or is there something better suited for his age?

autism,skybastion,2019/02/01,"Opinions on Savant-ism? I'm in a play that has a scene titled ""Savant"". It's a very blank play, so there aren't many given circumstances or anything to say about the characters except the context in the scene, and one of the characters in the scene appears to have near-perfect memory about what he did on specific days in his life (for example, someone says ""June 14, 2004"", and he can tell them everything he did that day in excruciating detail). I was discussing this scene with a few of my fellow actors, and they continued to reference ""Rain Man"", which made me uncomfortable because that is not, on the whole, an entirely accurate picture of autism.

I asserted that I didn't think that all people with this sort of memory necessarily had to be autistic, and one of the other actors said they thought the person should \*only\* be able to be autistic. Now, I will admit that skills such as these thrive in people where much of their brain power and time is devoted to only a few things (hence why so many autistics with Special Interests know so much about their beloved topics). In my personal opinion, one should not play a character (especially in such a blank show) as autistic when the actor is not if they don't have to, and almost the same mileage would be achieved in the scene if the character was played as just someone who has ridiculously good memory, rather than autistic or not autistic.

I just feel as though it begins to narrow down the view of what autistic people can be, if they \*only\* view us as savants, or as though all of us \*only\* have eidetic memory, and it concerns me that when it comes to near-perfect recall, autistics are apparently the only ones who fit the bill. 

In summary, my questions are:  
1. Can ""savants"" be allistic?

2. Do ""savants"" as they're called even actually exist, or is it a gross oversimplification of our experiences?

3. If savants or something similar do exist, is near-perfect recall even a type of savant-ism?

3. Is Rain Man only an accurate depiction of one very specific man, rather than our whole community, and if so, how the hell do I explain that to allistics?

4. What's the best way to tell an allistic (that is half a century my senior) to stop acting like they know more than I do about my own community?

autism,LostOne000,2019/02/01,"Help in Chicago? Hi all. I suspect my 4 year old son is on the high end of the spectrum. His uncle (my wife's brother) is on the lower end of the spectrum. I've had my suspicions since he was born but my wife doesn't see it (or is lying to herself). 

Does anybody know of any good resources or places I can get him evaluated in Chicago or the surrounding suburbs? I know there are a lot of scammers out there in this field. I want to take him to the best possible place. Not somewhere that's going to say ""Yes, he's definitely autistic. Now give us money"".

Please help, if you can. My in-laws are being extremely stubborn, even though they've gone through this for 25 years with their son, they are of no help. If he is on his spectrum, I want to get him the help he needs asap.

autism,stabfacestab,2019/02/02,"Wanting to “finish” things Hello all, I’m an autistic adult who’s almost 30. A prominent thing in my life is this urge to “finish” things, be that tasks, food or whatever. 

Just now that urge has caused me to eat stupidly hot chilli despite this causing me considerable pain. 

This is also presently manifesting as the desire to fix an issue with my taxes even though it’s just shy of 5am and this is not possible.

My question is- how do I cope with this and stop it? I’ve spent periods of time awake and intensely anxious around things not being able to be “finished”. 

I’ve presently got sertraline as a medication, but would some meds to take on an “as and when” basis potentially benefit me? 

Regards,

autism,2blackndblue,2019/02/02,"How can I help my brother? He is not doing well I think he only seems to have online friends who he games with
At the moment his sleeping patterns are irregular, he doesn’t take showers, smells bad, and only seems to eat junk, making him overweight. He can basically eat a large pizza no problem and he has one at least once a week. Also he badly needs a haircut. 

My parents aren’t the most healthy themselves so they don’t really notice plus they are afraid to stand up to him, because when criticised he gets aggressive. Since I moved out to uni, I dont much feel like going home for longer than a weekend, I just dislike seeing my parents and brother go in a downward spiral, over which I have no control.. because in the end its their life ..

I must seem very judgmental right now but all I really want for him is a happier and healthier life, exploring more than just the gaming world. How can I help him without him getting aggressive at me? There have been times he would chase me wanting to kick me just for making one critical comment

autism,Whoneedsnapchat,2019/02/02,"I think I made a mistake getting another kitchen job. 
 I posted a little over a week ago that I got another kitchen job and I was really happy then.

Another pay period and a half later my schedule has been changed drastically and the quirks everyone seemed to love are now a huge topic of discussion among a few select people. The “clique” doesn’t seem to like me now because I tell them my limitations. 

They’re starting to target me with passive aggressiveness and sometimes just mean things like scheduling me by myself and calling all their friends and family to come eat and being hyper critical of my performance.

Last night at 9:00 I was told we were closed after a really slow night and at 10:00 after I was ready to walk out, all of a sudden there’s a to go order. After I cook that a table of 12 magically appears, then more and more and more.

autism,ThatGuyYouForget,2019/02/02,"Reaching deep sleep I'm not entirely sure if it's caused by the autism, anxiety or ADD, but I can't reach deep sleep, and it's driving me insane. I have a near perfect sleep schedule with 8 hours of sleep but sleeping doesn't ""recharge my batteries"" and I'm pretty sure that's why I've started showing signs of stress.

Have any of you experienced this, and/or have any ideas of how to reach deep sleep?

autism,LesbianBanana,2019/02/02,"I could really use some advice Hey guys. I was really hoping any of you could give me some advice.

I'm and 18 year old girl and I have autism. My intense social anxiety caused me to not be in school very often so my marks definitely showed that. I'm graduating high school this year, but I'm so, so scared of what's ahead. I applied for college but I honestly don't know if I'll even get in. I haven't been able to keep a job because retail jobs consist of me having a constant panic attack. But all I can get are retail jobs because I don't have experience. 

I just feel so stuck, like there is nothing ahead that I can actually do. I'm feeling so much pressure. Also my friends graduated last year and are now in university and college so I've been really lonely.

Anyway, it was kind of nice to get it all out. Does anyone have any advice, or at least is anyone going through something similar? I'd love to know I'm not alone.

I cannot go to college because of financial and high anxiety/learning disabled reasons. The job market for Texas is not very good if you don't have a degree and I often feel very discouraged.  I have tried to get SSI but the court ruled that I was too high functioning to qualify.  The long process of seeking SSI (Three years) only to fail took a toll on my mental health and that is not something I ever want to go through again.  I have worked as a nurses assistant $8 hr that was the most difficult experience in my working life. I tried to get certified CNA but I could not after two attempts pass the demonstration portion of the state exam and this made my managers angry. I quit after six months and it took two months of searching with the aide of a job coach (not job placement just someone who explains things and helps you look up jobs basically) to find another job. This job pays the same low pay but I am happy with my job duties and environment. I work at Golds gym. I work in the kids club watching children while their parents workout and I start training to work front desk so I can pick up more hours. Upon hire they agreed to work me full time and I believe that my hours will soon improve. As much as I like working here I'm concerned about my pay I know it is much too soon to ask for a raise the best I can do is probably work as much as I can. My question is how can I when the time is right, communicate and have my boss see that I am worthy of a pay raise that will give me a livable wage so I can meet my goals of being independent?

autism,Osixotin1,2019/02/03,"I’m frustrated, exhausted, and wishing I didn’t have Autism I’m usually not one to rant or even tell my struggles, but I’m getting close to a breaking point.  I went to the store today and, not surprisingly, got the foggy vision and anxiety that comes from overstimulation from the lights and noises. In the haze, I forgot some of my bags, and needless to say, I’m really ticked off about it (groceries can cost a lot, and I don’t have that kind of money). My girlfriend suggested we could go back in but I was already too far gone by the time we realized I had forgotten bags. Not to mention I have been sleeping like complete crap because everything seems like it has to come at once. I know people have recommended sunglasses and ear plugs but I would have to get prescription lenses which are hella expensive, and I can’t wear plugs because of ear canal damage and sensitivity. Everything has annoyed me tonight and I think it’s because I haven’t been able to bring myself down from the near meltdown when I left the store. That was hours ago. Today is one of those days where I’m feeling like I’m at the end of the fuse.",4.201724598930483,5.833209113636367,4.957967914438502,82.56606951871659,71.5,8.267379679144385,28.395721925133692,8.841846274778883,2.2021737967914436,895,34,174,17,17,289,131,220,0.124,0.79,0.086,-0.8592,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,2,0,0,0,6,11,3,1,11,0,21,6,5,0,0,33,42,15,0,3,7,0,1,3,1,1,1,3,0,0,8,15,0,1,5,0,5,6,7,6,0,2,10,5,20,5,25,30,2,30,0,1,0,0,7,12,1,4,14,111,28,0,0.15136939031000732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13417983140343054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1670398862454288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11579716927091477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11639371767354427,0.0,0.2768201261192843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26078265318054306,0.15870792581687518,0.0,0.0,0.12085614112315028,0.0,0.0,0.09762073427273407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13406835099931014,0.0,0.0,0.09997805470103964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27208209531200656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07653691188202735,0.10813832268250352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15816851779157945,0.0,0.08602671282214573,0.0,0.12106392928787656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490683584136364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15762792665851666,0.0831886582628324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16446328547268152,0.0,0.0,0.2218543144266958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128688842620946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16120346051768264,0.20514363268934613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10494047605727612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309300075374204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09697110746734988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203750146969762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13780100790151845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15147870747339887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582441525702141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13230351900689466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09699139328255674,0.0,0.0,0.08826470877015681,0.0,0.2869609657112845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16671199812008966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403209413224045,0.0,0.0,0.17406732854930435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10752847187625343,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,brokentelescope,2019/02/03,"How did you cope in high school English? I’m a high school English teacher, have been for 7-8 years now, and every few years I’ll get a kid with paperwork informing me that they are autistic. I haven’t really had a whole lot of training on that particular disability, but the teachers in the department talk to each other about what we have done with that kid that works or doesn’t. I always give a questionnaire to the kids and the students at the beginning of a semester with questions like “what kinds of activities really help you learn” or “what are your goals this year” or “what is something you think I should know about you?”

I get all kinds of answers, but more and more often I’m seeing a response that basically says “I am autistic and tend to think very very literally. English is hard for me.”

I totally understand that. English literature can be very subjective with interpretations and metaphors and whatnot. How can I better help my autistic students succeed? What worked for you in high school English? 

Thanks for the help.

autism,priestessjess,2019/02/03,"Where do i start? I have 2 children. 
Child A is 5 years old, child B is 2. I sought out help when child a was 3 years old and received Dial testing that made us eligible for pre k with a IEP and OT. Child A no longer has an IEP, and is enrolled in year 2 of pre k. Child A started stuttering about 6m ago, biological father also stutters. Extremely sensitive to loud sounds, nail bites, talks excessively, stims in the form of twirling about, swinging arms or objects often falling or tripping. Child a also makes a wooshing sound while stimming. Now child a is extremely bright and has an amazing vocabulary but requires an immense amount of sensory stimulation.
Child B is delayed verbally, and tends to use grunts or clicking sounds to communicate but does know a handful of words and their meanings. Can identify animals and loves cars. Will make long lines of cars in a row on furniture. Has aggressive outbursts of smacking own face and biting arms or couch. Sometimes cries for 30m apon waking from nap. Has no sense of danger.

I've mentioned my concerns to the pediatrician but we go to a office that has 7 and they rotate care, we see a different pediatrician each time. I share my concerns but haven't been taken incredibly seriously. What is the best method of care? How do I get the resources they may need? 

Excuse the vauge posting, I wanted to keep it to the point and Anon.

autism,jack13gun,2019/02/03,"Could I Have Autism? Recently, quite a few people have been telling me I have symptoms and signs of autism such as struggling in social situations, unable to make/maintain eye contact, wanting to have a regular routine. 

I did a (rather invasive) quiz online which told me I more than likely had autism and also got my friend and boyfriend to look at the symptoms online and see which I had. There were quite a few.

Could it be possible that, at age 16, with no diagnosis, I could be autistic?

autism,MarvinLazer,2019/02/03,"I may be autistic. Is there a good reason to see a psychologist and be diagnosed? I'm a man in my mid-30s. I've had it suggested to me by a few people that I may be on the autism spectrum over the years, including a woman I dated briefly who has ASD and a good friend who has a large number of family members with ASD. I also took a quiz online for ASD and it appears I check the boxes. The quiz results told me that there's an ""extremely high likelihood"" that I'm autistic.

My question is, is there any value to making an appointment with a psychologist and trying to get a formal diagnosis one way or the other?",5.660331428571425,5.215013775999999,7.2334857142857185,75.00760000000002,67.24,10.342857142857145,32.25714285714286,9.957137785484203,3.041194285714286,482,18,95,10,7,168,76,125,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.9013,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,17,0,11,1,0,3,0,14,19,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,2,8,6,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,3,1,9,3,12,11,1,9,0,0,1,0,8,4,0,5,2,68,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011441220954243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17104534493900184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552921621994073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371149963866701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19432727270209624,0.0,0.13141121589963894,0.0,0.0,0.4219337817072548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2657495368076865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16789461556465565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704395702898285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17437547937251735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817651025893416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2586091677544619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20043253158316174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24034252261788444,0.2794530719816186,0.17076868469785875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19964851039407602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16197358807028725

autism,Amicellini,2019/02/03,"Soon to be school companion/helper for a kid with autism, any pointers? Hey everyone, I got offered a job to help a girl (14 yrs old) in school. The vague description was, that she's having trouble with noticing when she is rude - loud, interrupting the class, picking her nose etc. - losing trail of thought, not remembering the dates for important tests and recognizing social cues.


I want to help her and do this job. I have however no prior experience with autism and would like to know from you how I can help best. I know I should mainly ask her and I will. But maybe you can tell me how to approach her best. How can I tell her to be quiet, for example. As I understand it I should be straight, explain it logically.

Is there a reason to have him diagnosed or am I being silly? He has made some progress since attending the school, but they're very much a ""bribe the kid until he does what we need"" kinda school and I'm worried it's not benefiting him as much as specialized therapies etc might. So... if he were diagnosed would they suggest specific areas and list off resources for her or would it just be ""yep, he's autistic, good luck"" sort of thing? This situation is really shitty and she needs help with him, but... Idk how to convince her that he needs more help than she can give him at home. The school only has a SLP on staff.

autism,NaturalBite,2019/02/04,"Does Anyone Else Reserch Everything They're Going to do Before You do It? Maybe Even When You've Done it Before? I'm going to a Sam Harris talk and I'm so excited. It's in DC and I'm going to ride the metro all by myself for the first time. I've ridden the metro before but never alone so I've been researching the DC metro constantly to see how it works and to look up roots and other things like that. Just looking at pictures and familiarizing myself with imagining how it would feel, and playing out images in my brain makes me feel less uneasy about the whole thing. I've been watching one of his talks every morning trying to prepare myself as if I just hear about Harris three hours ago and had to do a paper on him tomorrow.  

I do this with other things too. If I'm going to watch a movie with friends, I watch all the trailers, all the reviews, all the clips available online, and all the \*spoiler heavy\* reviews. It's kinda sick because I always prevent myself from having any real experiences, and my friends always get mad at me when they realize I watched a review before watching the movie. I watch videos of the rollercoasters I go on, and when I went to Slam Camp last year I consumed all the media on it I possibly could.

autism,praywithlegs,2019/02/04,"Concerned about my son, whose anger and violence is increasing with age. My son is a loving, brilliant, sweet, but troubled 14 yr old who has Aspergers. He attends a behavioral, therapeutic school. There are current family circumstances (divorce) and long-standing behavioral issues (defiance, screaming, cursing, running away) here. I need advice on getting him more help, and doing better for him as parents.

We’ve been too lenient with our son and not given consistent consequences for bad behavior, and now with the changes and intensity of the teenage era, he seems quicker to anger, more willing to be violent (break things, threaten and sometimes hurt people), and meaner (says horribly hurtful things to everyone including grandparents). 

He’s in therapy, and has a psychiatrist who is currently changing his meds after using the same one for years (in process). 

What other professionals, approaches, methods, books might be helpful? Any advice in general?

autism,priviet123,2019/02/04,"Going about getting proper diagnosis I’m a young female adult and think I may be on the spectrum but know, of course, that I should get proper diagnosis before looking too much into it. 

How do I even do this. Just go up to my doctor and say “hey doc I wanna find out whether I’m autistic or not, can you refer me to someone who can check that out?” Being a female, the presentation of any signs are much more subtle &amp; generally different than men, so I’m afraid he might just dismiss it completely. 

Any advice on how to approach the subject would be really helpful. I only opened up to a close friend about this but they laughed at me. It hurt. I don’t want this happening again, especially with my GP. Thank you!

autism,icevisionary,2019/02/04,"Oh Jordan! - A New Autism Web Series # [Watch Oh Jordan!](https://youtu.be/qrFC_BupZt8) a new web series on YouTube independently created by Spirit of Life Films.

# Oh Jordan! stars a fictionalized family called the Spinola’s and was created to increase autism acceptance and awareness. Using a little humor and lots of drama, the series demonstrates different characteristics of autism in every episode and gives examples of how ASD can impact the entire family.

Mikkel Palmer, who plays the titular character, Jordan, is the inspiration behind the series. Mikkel was born with Septo-Optic Dysplasia and is blind in one eye. He is also on the spectrum. Mikkel wanted kids like himself to know “they weren’t the only ones, that there were other kids like him... like them.” With the Oh Jordan! series, we hope to give some understanding to the situations that many find themselves in on a daily basis. We want families and individuals to know that they are not alone......Join the Oh Jordan family by watching the series at the web site listed below. Be sure to subscribe to our YouTube Channel. The first two of 7 episodes are posted online, with more to come!

and I would love to hear opinions on this. Is this a common problem? Have you experienced this?

I got to an Aspie/Autism meetup myself and I'm male. I've haven't noticed the men at my meetup pester the women like this (we have an almost equal split male and female in our group).

autism,water193,2019/02/05,"I feel like a friend of mine may be on the spectrum Typically his conversations with me are very to the point like :
Hello, how are you 
See you next week 
Have a good day 
Are we still going out tomorrow 
Basics like this. I know it sounds very silly of me to assume this but I just feel he’s very sort of limited to the way he expresses himself. And to add to it when i do meet with him. He just struggles to make conversation and I almost feel he seems around 15/16 in terms of his communication skill

autism,Pantomchap,2019/02/05,"Person with autism at my school with parents that don't even believe in mental disorders like the one he has This student (whom I'll call Al) is infamous around the school because he has been doing some things that are not socially acceptable. I think he desperately needs help with coping with his autism and learning things like body language and social skills. Al's speech seems fine, but he seems to not realize about his social boundaries like personal space and such. 

At lunch Al stands near a ""share table"" (where students that don't want to eat something drop off their food) and he gets in the way of others. The others get annoyed and I feel saddened seeing as I have heard that Al is very intelligent from one of his teachers.

I occasionally tell others why Al seems to be rude and that he doesn't really mean to. Some understand and others don't listen.

autism,crunchypens,2019/02/05,"Older Parents and Screening Hi,

In some other threads there was a discussion about pregnancy and complications and issues. A topic raised was autism and the age of the parents. 

I want to be respectful to this community and I don’t mean to offend anyone. I’m just wondering if there was any screenings that are useful. 

I would like to have children some day but a combination of working a lot and trying to meet someone that I want to build a life with have caused time to fly by. 

The only thing I have been able to learn is that scanning of the brain during the second trimester sometimes may show unusual brain development.

autism,marvelkitty23,2019/02/05,"Autism Acceptance Art ideas Hi All,

I work for a big urban school district and we are trying to   brainstorm ideas for an art installation that showcases, encompasses, informs, and encourages discussion of our very large nurodiverse community. Ideally the finished product would incorporate pieces completed by the students themselves and when the individual pieces are all combined they create a bigger picture. I would like the focus to be more towards understanding and acceptance (rather than Awareness) and I do not want to use puzzle pieces, lightbulbs, etc. 

I would appreciate any ideas! 

Thanks!

autism,diggingthistimesuck,2019/02/05,"Suspected autism in son, now attention difficulty is the issue First post on Reddit. We have long noticed autism spectrum like mannerisms in my 7 year old son, but recently his ability to focus has become problematic at school. Where do we start? We have avoided any diagnosis because we generally manage, and who needs the label if we are already working on things like teaching social norms and helping him manage. But now that his ability to focus is really affecting his school work... He is SO bright. He is SO animated. Part of me is afraid that getting diagnosed with attention disorder means medication, and I’ve seen how other kids seems to turn into a shell of themselves. Any advice from parents who have been here?

autism,BigCreamCat,2019/02/05,"A Study of Empathising and Systemising - Participants Needed Hi all! =) Firstly, thank you for letting me post this here. I’m Martha, a psychology student from the University of Bath. I’m conducting some research under the supervision of Dr Chris Ashwin at their Centre for Applied Autism Research, and would be delighted if any of you would be willing to take part.

It is a 20-minute questionnaire which can be completed via the link below. 

[https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_5aINyEuguqAtujr](https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5aINyEuguqAtujr) 

The study compares men and women with and without autism on a recently-developed measure of empathy. The aim is to identify whether there are differences on specific aspects of empathy. Firstly, this might contribute to the development of better, more targeted support in the future. Second, it might be linked to why women with ASD are so underrepresented. If you have questions, feel free to comment below or to email me at mb2153@bath.ac.uk.

autism,moldy_bread_666,2019/02/05,"How can I cope with my Asperger's in school? Hello Reddit! This is my first post in this sub so i'm kinda nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 14 year old girl in high school. Going to school every day is honestly very stressful for me. I seem like an average kid, i'm very good at pretending I have social skills by observing others, but inside i'm constantly freaking out, having to analyze every movement and word I say to make sure I seem ""normal"". I eat lunch alone in a specific counseling room because I can't handle the noise and all the people. Being too close to others in classrooms as well stresses me out, especially when they accidentally touch me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have learned to 'survive' in a school environment, but that doesn't mean i'm fully okay. I also have depression, and my ""coping methods"" are running to the bathroom and cutting myself with sharp pencils until I calm down. I'm way too scared to ask teachers to let me work in the counseling office if the classroom environment is too stressful. I don't want to miss valuable instruction time, because keeping up good grades is extremely important to me. I don't like the idea of home school though.

&amp;#x200B;

What are healthy coping mechanisms to use in school? What helps you guys to calm down that can be used in a public setting? Agh, hopefully this wasn't too confusing...",5.980574229691875,7.169262706349207,6.3459383753501415,75.96768907563029,66.77777777777777,9.262745098039217,33.07749766573296,9.478462496947786,3.1829385620915023,1070,46,185,21,17,345,153,252,0.123,0.7020000000000001,0.175,0.908,0,1,1,0,0,1,42.0,0,1,1,4,10,22,1,6,11,1,21,2,0,4,2,30,38,14,0,4,3,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,2,3,9,9,2,1,5,1,0,3,5,10,1,1,1,3,24,12,34,34,1,32,0,2,0,0,11,18,0,6,10,118,33,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09073722841423193,0.0,0.07006144614577946,0.0,0.2847752229201217,0.31936612780723744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819032438878381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10681212099215412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946749627409976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05650100930155496,0.0,0.0754581069970993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08964659579187241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476299031432319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07452076681793816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049790611979691285,0.1469657209776371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674737785439274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05872293577044736,0.09256445909209653,0.08787967324673868,0.0870162009162229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09890068841050996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787152756980857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08958685489446441,0.0,0.08560334903165423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05848015564167985,0.0,0.0,0.09543264792842407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08583890556719811,0.0,0.0,0.09193164354157013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0607375355040515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08390587589036151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06967075054021904,0.08771259422247492,0.5319941673301726,0.0,0.15951316259218054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930705710317953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30106984908685713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08257110626654862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08607608630145074,0.0,0.051085921125001967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1513333049150342,0.0,0.1445743569216492,0.05167447147146444,0.06954050266715621,0.0,0.0,0.07877164259834275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378090567128962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31936612780723744,0.0564177749735161
autism,marffff777,2019/02/05,"I think I may have Autism where do I start I am 21 years old, I am in college to become a math teacher.  I always have found it really hard to socialize well with others and when I was growing up (according to my parents) I was bad with things like personal space and how to talk to my peers. I also used to run around and wave my arms around while day dreaming since I was very young. As I grew up I learned to manage alot of these behaviors, to either not doing them at all of only doing them in private.  I still feel like socialising is hard to do, and while I got the hang of it, I still have often find myself feeling akwerd when speaking to people.  I have never been tested for autism in any form.  I don't like going out with anyone and I don't like to make eye contact with ppl when I speak to them if I can avoid it.  I have always had alot if trouble reading and writing as well. I work as a substitute teacher and within the past year I occasionally would sub for the assistants for some of our schools autism students (which I love to do).  When I would work in them I learned about about what it means to be on the spectrum and started to connect the dots that I may be on the spectrum.  I have no idea if I actually am but I feel like there is enough evidence for me to start looking seriously into how to find out.

So I have two main questions:

One, if what I described above seems like it may be autism or not?

Two, where would I start to look for a diagnosis?

I apologise for the long post and thank you to anyone who is willing to help.",5.788340401991519,4.888463235109718,6.413501751797899,82.5029301124839,67.11912225705329,9.386760095887883,30.6769315876821,8.4952907291091,2.031643776507468,1208,38,262,15,17,397,163,319,0.04,0.8540000000000001,0.107,0.9602,1,1,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,1,4,2,20,14,0,1,12,0,36,3,2,4,2,58,55,28,0,7,9,1,5,6,0,7,0,2,0,1,13,18,0,1,13,2,0,5,6,4,2,3,7,10,45,10,54,38,8,44,0,0,3,1,18,18,0,14,26,206,58,11,0.0,0.0,0.10537291304072943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08635157464434581,0.17969603612781826,0.0,0.0,0.07343010930272714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15100426670904504,0.0,0.0,0.1922502032248888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09015879766640322,0.0,0.11925543701615395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06963817321201572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157221476609916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1637938118308766,0.15428188083039948,0.0,0.0,0.19738354505592307,0.0,0.0,0.11839450707819832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0613675278412873,0.0,0.08636147781804887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19345775828614425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07237672429663912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189628743727847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3165214703818175,0.0,0.0,0.09555891054038353,0.18135202516389826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09745617446171546,0.0,0.07207749486926178,0.0,0.0,0.11762188585077207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08328084014002238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1133068558553512,0.0,0.07317004903205747,0.08212366304672675,0.0,0.0,0.1198990220595016,0.0,0.10307913733128694,0.07485974268756447,0.0942839793770206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341500074049263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096232310916125,0.0,0.10800923049826583,0.0,0.0691747591193689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10928153446662134,0.0,0.0983009452707687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932217975436814,0.0,0.0,0.110072021517595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057152261865738,0.0,0.17246595025876366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679024148563651,0.0,0.0994134852440638,0.0,0.0,0.07173712032080415,0.06918923009342627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2109615584897901,0.0,0.0,0.09326005880863006,0.0,0.08909481648010588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19417399296997764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1572214660113785,0.0,0.0,0.2301177021109547,0.0,0.0,0.13907117180415093

autism,oryx8o8,2019/02/05,"Finding the Right Words I'm posting this in hopes of inspiring anyone that might be going through what I have and not realize it.

Background:
Younger sibling on the spectrum. High functioning/ difficulty in interaction behaviour at times. Sibling always discussed living independently but their current life skills are lacking for that to be considered a viable option in the near future.

Parents are separating and are moving to their respective homes. Sibling moving in with one parent; I've moved out long ago.


Event:

A couple nights ago I was tossing and turning in bed, feeling sorry for myself and stressed out about how to help my sibling cope with moving out of our family home while managing their expectations of them being able to live independently in the near future.

Whenever we discussed this, the conversations always ended up being bitter and putting additional strain on our relationship. I've realized that my parents and I have simply only ever told my sibling ""yes or no"" to her endevours, but never provided any solutions. Somehow we believed that because she is high functioning ""enough"" that she would be able to pave the way herself. Of course, over the years my sibling became more distant and reclusive and as a family became frustrated that we were going no where. It's clear that she needs assistance from time to time and we want to offer her help, but we all came from a place of dead ends.

And it finally came to me that we failed as family support in not providing her solutions, we failed when we always resorted to just ""yes or no"" resolutions, and we failed in not listening deeper and preparing her with skills rather than assuming she would pick them up herself. She had every right to become distant and reclusive if she knew that we were only ever give her a yes or no answer, and our frustrations as a family finally made sense.

I spoke with my sibling yesterday. I apologized and said I'm sorry that we as a family never offered you solutions to your goals. I'm sorry we said No more often than Yes. I said that her feelings towards us is fair and I'm sorry that we ever made her feel unheard, and that going forward I will be more proactive in providing solutions and avoiding closed ended answers. And it clicked. I asked for forgiveness and asked if we can start over our relationship. She acknowledged that I finally understood her frustrations and is said to feel relieved that I found the right words to how she has been feeling all this time.

I've tried to discuss this realization with one parent and eventually they understood and will try to be more proactive in their parenting style going forward.

Said parent texted me this morning and said that they had a good conversation with my sibling about everything and is happy to have our family finally understand and be able to rebuild our relationship.

I know this is such a simple idea and I'm ashamed I didn't realize it sooner. My parents don't completely understand it yet and it will be a learning curve. But I'm glad I've realized it sooner than later and I can finally have a sister again.



Tldr
Neglected to hear siblings needs. Ruined relationship over time. Realized we offered no solutions in preparing them for their future and goals. Apologized and on the path to helping sibling achieve their goals and rebuild family relations.

autism,droidorat,2019/02/05,"Top medical centres for autistic child Hi All,

for starters this is not a post about the clinics which ""cure"" autism.

&amp;#x200B;

Our son who is 7.5 years old now has been diagnosed on the middle of the ASD at the age of 3.5 yo. Given we are living in the UK we have been struggling with the local NHS. Therefore, we want to have an additional diagnostic for our son (i.e. to rule out things like brain inflammation and other pathologies/check for other options available and potentially overlooked by us all this time). 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if you could suggest the highly acclaimed, recognised clinics/medical centres with substantial experience of working with the autistic children in countries like Israel, the USA or the EU countries.

autism,failedvessel,2019/02/05,"Got an adult autism screen screening 
*Spoiler alert:  My assessment was negative (I probably am not “on the spectrum”.)*

Since some people here are undiagnosed and some are adults, I thought it would be a good idea for me to briefly talk about my experience with the autism screening process.  

I am currently a graduate student at a large state university.  I’m a 26 year old male.  Last summer I went down to the campus mental health clinic, primarily because of depression, suicidal ideation, and anxiety.  I had also had it in my mind for awhile that I could have autism.  I don’t make friends easily, I have trouble with attention and social cues,  I tend to get obsessive about specific things, I have a few verbal and physical tics, I have sensitivity to pressure and texture, I am very clumsy,  I have a slightly stilted and broken manner of speech.  I mentioned autism to the triage worker at the clinic and she referred me to our university’s autism research center.  So I sent in the application.  

A few months later they sent me a packet of question, and asked for permission to send questionnaires to my parents.  These were general questions about work and living arrangement, as well as current and childhood behavioral questions.  Once the Autism center got my packet and the packets from my parents, I was assigned a psychologist and got an initial screening appointment.  This was just a short(like 45 minute) interview.  Basically questions about current and past behavioral stuff.  The way my psychologist described it to me, basically the initial screening appointment is to clear out any obvious negatives.  After that, we scheduled a full screening.  In the meantime, my psychologist conducted interviews with my parents to get some idea of childhood and developmental issues.

The full screening basically consisted of two main parts.  The first was an IQ test, and the second was behavioral observation types of tests.  The IQ test basically involves some spatial reasoning and pattern recognition, as well as some word games.

The behavior observation stuff consisted of a set of interview questions and games.  My understanding is that these test mental and social aspects that are signs of autism.  Obviously I don’t want to go into detail, so as to not bias anyone else’s results.  Suffice to say, it was basically painless.

My psychologist’s conclusion was that while I do have a lot of the low priority symptoms, I do not have strong levels on many of the higher priority symptoms.  This is fairly in line with what I expected.  I assumed that I either had a little bit, or was just close but not quite over the line.  Fundamentally autism is a diagnosis based on subjective factors.  My psychologist theorized to me that many of my autism-like symptoms are likely better explained by long term depression and anxiety.

So overall it took about 9 months, but that is mostly because our university’s autism center has a bit of a backlog.  Other psychologists who are qualified to diagnose autism likely could have gotten to me faster, but most of the steps would likely be the same.  So to my estimation, if you wanted to get started on the process, but didn’t have my access to the university’s mental health clinic, you could mention it to your general practitioner doctor, or you could seek out a psychologist/therapist in your area who specializes in autism.  As a side note, it looks like my insurance will cover most/all of the cost for this.

PS.  I maxed out the non-verbal section of IQ test that was given, and did pretty well on the verbal portion, so my aggregate IQ was around a 145(like 99.9th percentile).  My psychologist actually seemed pretty excited because she hadn’t seen someone max out their non-verbal IQ chart.

What is something that your parents did that you didn't particularly like, didn't approve of, wished they hadnt done?
What are some things that you really appreciated that they did for you, things that you wish that you could say thank you for?
Ive been doing a lot of research and there's just so much information going out right now and I wanted to see if maybe you guys could give me new or confirm information.
Thanks for you time.
I hope to hear from you guys.

autism,kiyote23,2019/02/05,"Antihistamines Every summer from about mid-August to mid-September, I get really bad hay fever. I've tried several different antihistamines to combat it, but the only one that really works for me is Benadryl. Unfortunately, Benadryl makes me a zombie and makes it harder for me to empathetic and relate to people, to the point that my partner has told me I can't take it this year because of what an asshole I become.

I was wondering if anyone else had trouble with antihistamines, or allergies, and which drugs seem to work better than others.

autism,lubodogg,2019/02/05,"I’m tired of arguing and I want to like my kid again. Sorry guys this is long. 

I have a 9 year old son. I would say my son and I don’t really have fun anymore. We used to have fun. I will say since starting school I have more trouble connecting with him in a positive way. 

Now I’m the more disciplined parent so you know I’m always the bad guy. Dad pitches in too but their relationship is pretty solid. 

My son was diagnosed with mild to moderate autism and ADHD. He is high functioning so yes he has issues but he really is a pretty easy going kid to outsiders/new people. People would describe him as quirky, funny and imaginative. He fits in well with a group of kids at school. Overall is doing ok. 

He has a laundry list of things that are hard to deal with but that’s him. For example he has problems with textures, disorganization, transitions from tasks and expressing his feelings or understanding others perspective. I know some of what he is dealing with so does his dad. I have ADHD and his dad is probably autistic, never formally diagnosed. Very similar issues as a kid. 

Over the years I’ve developed coping mechanisms to help me be successful in my life. I’m not saying I know it all but it keeps my anxiety and depression down. 

I can tell my son has similar issues. He gets overwhelmed. Anything that he doesn’t like to do turns into an argument. Which is everything that doesn’t involve his interest. “Why do I have to?” Is his favorite line. 

I try to create structure for him. We are doing small amount of work over the week. Dad helps with homework. I also help him with chores. Like I said every activity or chore that is asked of him turns into an argument. He is using his diagnosis as a get of jail free card also. Some of his previous teachers have told him his uniqueness (autism) is special. This has led to some very difficult behaviors. 

Now I’m yelling all the time. Im beginning to resent him for all the work I have to do. I’m doing it for him so he doesn’t feel overwhelmed. I feel hurt and disrespected all the time. 

I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t like who I am around him and I am sure he doesn’t like me either. School is getting academically harder for him which has always been easy for him. He doesn’t like his teacher. I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so exhausted. WTF do I do?

autism,DrJohnLennon,2019/02/05,How do you make friends? I’m always told I’m autistic and I just have always been alone. I have never really had friends just family. Just I have been taught to be silent and no facial expressions etc (went to Christian school 1st - 5th). And I am always so stressed when around people I just go silent and emotionless.

autism,milkso,2019/02/06,"Insight on autistic guy I'm talking to?  So I've been on this app for making friends and met a guy I thought was cute so I added him on Snapchat. He is 19, and I am 18 He lives across the country and we've been talking a lot over the past few days. The conversations haven't had much substance beyond ""OMG YOU'RE SO CUTE NO YOU ARE"" but last night he did tell me that he has high functioning autism. 

I really don't know anything about the autistic spectrum but some of his behavior has been confusing me so I figured I'd try here to get some insight. Forgive me for my ignorance.

He has said worrying things like ""I have no friends in my real life"" and ""I never leave my house"". Anyways, I chatted with him tonight on Discord for about an hour (chatted is a strong word, we really just watched videos together) and after telling him I had to go and beginning to say goodbye, he said ""I love you."" I was kind of stunned and just laughed, but then he said ""say it back"" in kind of a playful way, but it still creeped me out. I told him I only say that kind of thing if I really mean it. He said he did too, and then told me ""it's okay, you can say it tomorrow."" Throughout the day he's been calling me ""hun"" through text message.

I don't know if this has to do in any way with his autism (and I mean that in the best way), but it really put me off and I'm not sure if his emotional capacity is very childish, he is very lonely, or what. It almost feels kind of middle school, like just because I've told him I like him he thinks we're dating or something. I feel like I like him, but not this much and certainly not if he is genuinely saying ""I love you"" so early on to someone he doesn't know hardly anything about. Tonight is only the second night we've voice chatted.

Am I toying with his emotions by continuing to talk to him? Should I break things off? Like I said, I like him and would like the chance to get to know him better, but I'm not sure he is mature enough to understand what he's saying or where our ""relationship"" stands. I'm also not sure if I know what I'm getting into.  If I do break things off, how do I do it in the kindest and clearest way?",3.3406882678353327,4.038896091314037,4.381649543789067,89.44567497665064,72.49665924276171,7.575285580860694,27.62418277175085,7.717688229018142,1.3672822903944244,1671,59,377,20,31,545,195,449,0.069,0.7490000000000001,0.181,0.9955,0,2,1,0,0,0,59.0,2,4,0,3,20,32,0,1,14,1,36,3,0,2,5,76,70,38,0,8,24,0,3,8,2,2,1,12,0,2,21,19,0,1,16,6,0,2,12,3,0,1,20,16,57,29,46,48,8,50,0,1,1,2,70,21,0,14,28,238,78,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068120107777615,0.0,0.0,0.056447213927749776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048000573303042735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11617173548594473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05427590701664173,0.0,0.04302827714386268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740751472595187,0.06242715535728485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07207570668667401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09104364053640876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15879841632506575,0.0,0.07293370967737438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07138031838283704,0.05042630877478385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906839354726468,0.0,0.11063406087810372,0.0,0.040115377010106486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397815222149315,0.0,0.0,0.06323076048663538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745774760858654,0.0,0.0,0.0695125177037021,0.08144621176730607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29401582358729905,0.19395977596387684,0.057536618791805674,0.0,0.07473987272475457,0.0,0.0,0.049856639430182544,0.2758761528083419,0.0,0.06232830633700075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060009283969810825,0.12741237322140167,0.0,0.04711638194229398,0.0,0.0,0.15377664577744066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10377695606693577,0.0,0.05443990360139179,0.0,0.0,0.1324794557054108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10736693559143012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06738186466652975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07095794230197452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034177359546436,0.18087556330009566,0.0,0.0,0.07578243135894262,0.0,0.0,0.3357149617688446,0.33679462614011785,0.0,0.07143631346384544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05980688106850141,0.05434018091222589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05636968653788488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995780485310296,0.0,0.0,0.17020189897492174,0.12338970932663815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18757552917765136,0.04522835036495383,0.0,0.05603701749314624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20234246443021536,0.0,0.047922933948462434,0.0,0.0,0.07348201446170699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164808907404318,0.0,0.2241099975315132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07168302070146358,0.0,0.050141927398231464,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,juliansatx,2019/02/06,"Autism/ needles/ freak out/ numbing agents - HELP! So my 9 yr old son is on the high end spectrum and needs some serious labs ASAP. His pedi and the staff couldn’t control him. He previously got labs done before with some sort of spray (used 2 times) and some sort of cream (used 2 times) within the past 4 years. But the idea of a needle going in his arm without either one of these terrified him and it just wasn’t possible. So my pedi said that I got lucky previously and labcorp nor quest diagnostics will do this. Only the hospital will, apparently. Well, I’m not to keen on wasting my Thursday sitting in a hospital for something that we can do in 5 minutes. So to my point, what is this spray / cream they used? I think google said lidocaine was the best. Do I just buy the same stuff I put on my back? Or do I go to the tattoo shop?

autism,mrsyoungston,2019/02/06,"iPad Woes My son is nonverbal and we’ve been trying to utilize an iPad for speech because it will really benefit him now and in the future. He’s six years old and getting more and more agitated with his lack of expression and voice. 

He LOVES the iPad, but the screens keep getting broken. The screen typically does not break from a fall or drop, but from being accidentally sat or stepped on. It happens in an instant, so there’s really no level of supervision that could prevent it.  We’re using a foam case with a handle and a tempered glass screen protector. I’m looking for any product recommendations, ideas, thoughts...anything. I’m not sure there’s anything out there to protect it from pressure cracks. What do you guys think? Anyone else struggle with this?

autism,Sharyat,2019/02/06,"Advice about work I dropped out of university two years ago, I couldn't cope with it and I was only there because it's what my parents wanted. My ASD only got recognised when I was 21 and suicidal, and my parents have tried to accommodate to what I tell them, but still mostly treat me neurotypically and pressure me into things. 

I've been guilted for staying with them and being unemployed for the last two years, but I just had a job interview yesterday, and I think it went pretty well. But I'm terrified. It takes so much energy just to go out once every week or two, and now I feel like I'm being pressured into another thing I know I won't be able to cope with because it's what my parents wanted. 

I'm terrified now that I'll get a phone call and be told I got the job, and have no idea how to respond because I'm pretty sure a 9-5 job every day will just make me relapse into a dead, suicidal husk again, like how I was at uni and school before that. I have no idea what to do, or if I turn it down, what I could \*ever\* do to make a living and survive. I need advice.",7.445866666666667,4.8879148533333385,8.184111111111111,76.46150000000002,64.91111111111111,11.133333333333333,34.5,9.3871,2.8593999999999995,842,27,180,12,10,286,119,225,0.153,0.733,0.114,-0.9078,8,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,2,2,15,8,0,3,7,0,18,0,0,4,2,45,38,21,3,6,9,3,1,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,15,19,0,0,5,0,0,2,4,3,1,3,9,1,25,5,21,21,2,24,0,0,0,0,11,7,0,4,15,124,40,7,0.10679446105889373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087166227082132,0.09466684611964926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198330400084484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19530273669345355,0.0,0.09087422057739283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10904908507768662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0852666872111405,0.0,0.0,0.0688735924976562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660170412605117,0.17995787889890985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05399848832589749,0.07629398431901598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05579569812444121,0.0,0.060693753299090186,0.0,0.17082657273695895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24111589493802796,0.0,0.0,0.3179310718358429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05869144288152905,0.08705173942984164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043487585535667,0.0,0.09430146568022996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14257226405878454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850621680646644,0.07918673968746713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373261563356125,0.0,0.16244399995602252,0.0,0.0,0.35574783220054723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2172967203973676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10808169607576623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11382868603359493,0.08528619455366171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23363161391200515,0.0,0.10065251568747506,0.0,0.08029614398162258,0.0,0.09334306612188492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14189898913310056,0.06842957847520018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10204668411785853,0.0,0.0725064288864539,0.11616170683059493,0.31296801183727585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12598028016322374,0.0,0.08566407491885669,0.0,0.0960210459911194,0.09899953532951583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774763956676711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754426305596906

autism,imnumbereight,2019/02/06,"Insulted by another therapist.. I saw a therapist yesterday to deal with panic/anxiety attacks that I get frequently. It was a 15 minute consultation appointment to see if he's normal, because his website was trying really hard to sell his ""product"". I tell him a very brief description of my mental health, and I mentioned that I have autism, but I'm here about my anxiety. He then starts asking about my family, and I said that we've never gotten along until the last couple years and I live in their basement suite. He starts trying to sell me this conspiracy theory that over-bearing parents cause autism, and that many scientists believe that theory.

So.. Do scientists believe that parents cause autism? I'm so confused, pissed off, and offended by this loser.

autism,artseasteph,2019/02/06,"Ontario Autism Program, is there a way around the ABA services? I want the funding, not the ABA. I am looking for ANY suggestions or recommendations from fellow parents who ACCEPT neurodiversity AND especially from any #ActuallyAutistic people, and anyone who has dealt with the OAP. 

I am trying to see if being part of the Ontario Autism Program, specifically in Toronto, I can access any services that do NOT force ABA. 

I would really appreciate any suggestions for an ABA certified provider who can work with us, not implementing actual ABA. It seems ONLY ABA certified providers are given funding here which is infuriating. 
Please link me another subreddit that can help if you have suggestions!

autism,MultipleStatusAroun,2019/02/06,"As an autistic person, I really dislike calling anti-autistic behavior ableist. Definition of ableism: discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities.

The term ""ableist"" only applies to disabilities. I refuse to consider autism a disability. It's an alternative state of being. Therefore, ""ableist"" does not apply to anti-autistic actions.

Now don't get me wrong. Making fun of people with autism, or discriminating against people with autism is wrong and I am absolutely against that. However they are not ableist. I refuse to use the word ""ableist"" to describe those behaviors.

What do you think?

My wife and I have noticed behaviors that indicated I was somewhere I was ok the spectrum for a while now, and having some kind of professional assurance is really uplifting. It tells me that I’m not just socially deficient, I’m not just bad at communicating with others.

autism,bubbletrollbutt,2019/02/07,"Has ABA helped you/your child? I just left the Doctors with my kids.  The doctor is really pushing ABA for my oldest son. Mostly how he is hard to control in times he is not at home. I don’t know if I am explaining it right. He is almoat as tall as me at 9. He is so cute and tall! 

I just get so overwhelmed trying to see how ABA works and I hear conflicting things. no one answer helps because i hear it is bad and good. I guess it depends?
I just feel like at the end of my rope some days and I want what’s best for my son. I am just feeling emotional I guess right now since today is one of the harder days where he is too big for me to get him to do things.

autism,Electrathescientist,2019/02/07,"New Diagnosis Autism All - our two year old just got diagnosed with autism in Middle Tennessee. All of the standardized testing was unable to be done because of the rigidity of his behavior. The psychologist told us the biggest priority right now will be ABA therapy. We are choosing to do therapy at the center rather than our home due to living far from the credentialed ABA therapy centers we were recommended to use. Eventually, he will need speech, occupational, and developmental therapy. 

Does center based therapy sound like a good idea? Or is home based a much better option? Also - what are some things we must get to make this journey easier to help aid in his therapy. How quickly will his ABA therapy work? What other advice or things you wish you would have known earlier with your child.

My husband and I have been reminding our almost four year old everyday for the last two months that we will be moving to a new home. We tell him he will be making new friends, starting school and is also going to be taking care of and riding a horse. (He's super excited for those parts.) As it gets closer I am starting to purge the house. I'm noticing he is stimming and screaming more than usual. I try to encourage him to be a big helper, observer, anything to help him feel more comfortable about this process. Does anyone have any advise on this? I would never redirect or stop his stimming unless it is a danger to himself or others. If I could I wouldn't go through anything in the house, but with the time limit that's not possible. I just feel lost and sad that I am upsetting him.",3.9919012237762246,5.299318198863637,4.909318181818184,83.97868881118885,71.55681818181819,7.460839160839161,27.174825174825173,7.882392219407189,1.6570966783216776,697,24,134,9,13,227,114,176,0.087,0.8109999999999999,0.102,-0.4218,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,4,1,0,3,3,12,1,1,10,0,19,0,0,1,1,27,32,12,0,5,7,1,2,0,1,5,0,1,1,0,9,9,0,2,2,0,0,7,3,5,0,2,2,3,20,7,21,19,3,29,0,2,0,0,22,8,0,4,14,97,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337892354811221,0.0,0.0,0.1370980149735124,0.0,0.0,0.10948881544562432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310514276909886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09573234974176027,0.0,0.22533451735809246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13959134028611794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10931342933748568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11981298426386368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13845406995412896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10577819861341768,0.0,0.0715310903208738,0.0,0.15562097061559196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09176951134604976,0.0,0.13733432372368415,0.0,0.0,0.31595710854214343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11160189844488186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372222163278942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14945608328783172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913901056932292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21856438011012902,0.43654871568460496,0.0,0.10151882706381067,0.10559530122991807,0.26446174315137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15587570137322207,0.14366655710177975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14826281241254727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15434818579790824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13856268178213235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19381463578817787,0.0,0.0,0.11446491640890105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10294110335813374,0.0,0.11966749262103105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07983473504510308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09295454825125712,0.0,0.13374354340811276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15078969142032814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725865730095763,0.0,0.0,0.0881671117532332

autism,anonanonemail,2019/02/07,"I’ve been depressed for a while. Just wanted to write with my alt and maybe hear if somebody had an opinion To start this story off, I have to give some background info. I’m gay, and I’ve been highly suspected of being autistic. I went to a doctor for ASD when I was 3/4 but I didn’t get a diagnosis. My parents didn’t pursue it further, so I’m left with another thing to add to my mess of a life. I’m 16, in high school, and have 4 decent friends I talk to.
     And onto the likely reasons I’ve been feeling this way. Firstly, I was the absolute focus of my mother’s life for several years. When I was about 5 or 6, my mom and stepdad decided to have another kid so I wouldn’t be lonely. This kid was my sister, and as much as I love her, she is a “handful”. This stressed out my mother, and drove her to sleep the whole day with the door locked, and giving any of her awake time to my sister. This obviously was a damper, but I as a little kid didn’t notice the gradual transition.
      My mom broke up with my dad while I was a little kid. I don’t remember anything from before that divorce. She met up with my stepdad, who I also grew a great relationship with. I also went to yearly/bi-yearly trips to my dad’s house. Each year, I’d see worse and worse things. It never got too bad, until the last trip, in which one of my half-brothers was given a death threat for going to the police. I left soon afterwards. The family on his side is gradually falling apart to this day
     When I was 11 or 12, I was coming back from a trip to my dad’s house. By this time, everyone knew my mother was failing her job as a mother. Even I knew something was wrong. On that day, I was told she was found cheating on my stepdad, and the family is split up over the decision. Before I went on the trip I was returning from, I spotted her sitting in her car smoking something from a pipe. (Not one of the tobacco ones. It was one of the improvised crack pipes). I was obviously devastated, but depression already set in. I’m probably glad about that, because I’d still be able to function to some degree. Life went on with me continuing to live at a family member’s house. 
      For the next three years, I’d be ripped apart by intense bullying, coming to terms with my sexuality, and my family constantly attempting to “heal” my relationship with my mother. I finally got in two huge fights within a week to stop the bullying. I was constantly depressed, and nothing seemed to help. Thankfully, in 7th or 8th grade, I met a really funny and great friend (girl, one year younger than me) who is still a friend of mine to this day. Our awkward personalities go great to fuel each other. Probably the only reason I hadn’t tried offing myself.
     I also had developed a crush for an autistic guy in my school. He was nice and quiet, and I loved him. My family acts accepting, but they are clearly anti-gay. Some of them are worse than others. There is no way I’d ever come out to them. 
     It’s seemed to be a mix of these things that hit me with such a bad time today. I’ll hopefully get over it within a few days, but honestly, this freaking sucks.",3.6474285714285735,4.653246980952382,5.228730158730159,82.51071428571429,72.04761904761905,8.457142857142857,26.222222222222214,8.841846274778883,1.853498412698412,2418,77,497,45,45,820,289,630,0.151,0.723,0.127,-0.9389,2,2,3,0,3,0,85.0,1,0,3,3,20,32,4,2,39,0,44,10,2,2,5,72,84,39,1,4,11,13,2,1,3,1,5,2,1,7,27,33,0,1,14,0,0,18,9,17,0,8,41,5,71,15,92,36,9,95,0,6,1,3,56,35,1,11,39,336,98,6,0.06314883533321174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06968631008546533,0.15150030240277088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04294337349241807,0.13243411979051184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05196611084975399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04855755642626152,0.10545327954923554,0.038494943892827226,0.0,0.10747001547413752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16319139017864673,0.0,0.1364829139208992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.203628873085596,0.0,0.16316999801880122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06463550880880968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04170921016673601,0.05712173689794205,0.0,0.060341418344769686,0.0,0.0,0.29765550924865625,0.0,0.031929948554672544,0.0,0.0,0.06917646241684801,0.0,0.05371436707483242,0.0,0.06923943849721301,0.1463659005929412,0.0,0.06598532017908436,0.1211562340716813,0.07177787677069113,0.0,0.1010117847437254,0.208865441669516,0.0,0.06252727522562765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07117332693808621,0.0,0.0423273332035325,0.1334404232823687,0.0,0.06272104216118005,0.0,0.21859583234879554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06266547504307159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05147472915934457,0.0,0.0,0.13722278872106605,0.0,0.13381166978633327,0.030851331172926436,0.1265834455963465,0.05576157853952138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139885787667286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06344149287257453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14791830544582046,0.0,0.0,0.04642165996802985,0.0,0.04870427481118456,0.0,0.06715950278478787,0.0,0.0,0.060593010635723824,0.07189536757452401,0.0,0.0,0.21395642563244074,0.048027534866410725,0.0,0.0,0.07011930847671534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055139127248833686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13617025025616655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0404547609327988,0.12985504029242906,0.0,0.1355964327119533,0.07153532030278628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278199854252535,0.05032144585329761,0.114976655965936,0.0,0.07134020932518152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06319444066686583,0.0,0.0,0.09723011722492744,0.0,0.0,0.04469707067411898,0.0,0.10086148293955786,0.05279525395623241,0.07233677751655072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05075664180546746,0.0,0.05813896326122275,0.0,0.0,0.1258598406209541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046778113683188,0.0,0.05985771209637784,0.060341418344769686,0.0,0.04287391399283245,0.0,0.06168723623589373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03724681920943489,0.10024921230233096,0.05065418662527433,0.0,0.0,0.2341584120599834,0.0,0.07050341947460942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19306217448142907,0.0,0.0690433381666186,0.0,0.2033288976934728

We are flying from Cali to Florida with one stop. I'm excited but nervous. We are also flying with my 5 year old and my baby who will be almost 9 months. Where should we sit? Front, or back? Near restrooms?

autism,RebelRoad,2019/02/08,"Tips for brushing teeth/ 2yo son autistic &amp; SPD I'm desperate for help here. My son is 2. He currently receiving therapy through EI, 2x a week, speech and OT. He is hyposensitive, meaning he seeks stimulation. There are a few instances where he bucks against sensation, one of these is oral hygiene. 

As many of you know, the day to day of caring for a child on the spectrum is challenging. For the most part, I accept the bad and embrace all the sweetness when it comes our way....but I *dread* when it's time to brush his teeth.

I used to just bite the bullet and wait for the inevitable scream so his mouth would open and I could quickly brush. He became hip to my game and now clamps his mouth shut.

I'm sure I'm not the only parent of a child on the spectrum who deals with this. What do you all do??

autism,enytsyrk,2019/02/08,"New diagnosis at almost 18years old Hi 
My son is almost 18, has been out of high school for almost a year and a half. He has 2 of his grade 11 credits. He was diagnosed as autistic last month. He has such high anxiety he hasn't returned. 
I am looking for ideas to help me get him interested in learning again. Either in a formal school setting, online, offline, book, whatever! I don't believe school is for everybody but would like him to finish his education or do something besides hide at home. 
I just filled out his OSSP (disability papers) and it took me so long... I really didn't realize how many accommodations and modifications we have made in our house for him. He has a brother who is 3 years older and a brother who is 3 years younger than him. He has recently gotten into D&amp;D and goes to the local youth Center to play with a bunch of kids. His dad and his brothers all play role-playing games together at home as well. It is one of the few things that has caught his attention lately besides still playing Pokemon on his phone.
I have a friend who is on the autism scale as well and I had her talk to my son just to let him know that she was autistic as well. Autism wasn't a common subject in her house. She asked him how he felt about the diagnosis and he said I'm just me.
I would really like to help him feel more confident, and have some sort of drive for life. Either heaven want to learn something or do something, to have a goal to get out of the house everyday.
Any suggestions?",3.4918903803131967,5.177883463087252,4.5766610738255045,84.36564038031321,73.42953020134227,7.651230425055928,26.510626398210288,8.344100000000001,1.7161002237136458,1184,42,238,20,24,387,161,298,0.015,0.831,0.154,0.9915,0,0,3,0,0,0,33.0,2,0,0,1,13,12,0,0,14,0,30,2,0,3,1,43,44,19,0,3,8,6,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,8,15,0,0,8,5,1,4,4,0,3,2,12,4,32,12,41,29,7,40,1,0,1,0,48,17,0,7,20,158,40,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3229666070612277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164868241895468,0.0,0.07311035117441733,0.0,0.08224470330227845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10050715093980228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12112672967268025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912018469214176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054360185564493305,0.0,0.1032262685028742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306180536561011,0.0,0.11233886717122887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14412310645940296,0.2271800143684411,0.21568219192016694,0.0,0.0,0.3721556265510012,0.0,0.12136547890261908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05908457486499,0.0876348367487278,0.12127573803710462,0.0,0.0,0.1099360552731066,0.07593735170837826,0.10504771622793597,0.0,0.0,0.09514279052275224,0.090281155590163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017283729426792,0.0,0.10899806362445354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581329725093244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10383363549501144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128134507862724,0.0,0.0728514233599865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13774706260541986,0.0,0.10615295815619252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10226644000466747,0.0,0.0,0.3264169740832926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2482988912002663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585746575062984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08641230543955776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142473446788994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194473444257248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06341206596199538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2899926668319696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15274375568403722,0.0,0.0,0.20769836049654875

autism,bakedmaga2020,2019/02/08,"Weed and autism I asked this same question in r/weed but I figured I could get more information from peeps who are more knowledgeable about autism 

So I have this friend with low level autism who I smoke weed with a lot. Whenever we smoke though, he can’t handle his weed. I’ll just be chilling there and he’ll be pacing around the room, making weird noises, calling his ex, etc. I don’t have a problem with this as long as he stays relatively quite because we live in a dorm. He also can’t seem to build up a tolerance even though he’s smoked weed several times a day everyday since the year began and he still interacts with weed as if he were an amateur. I’ve asked him if his autism affects that at all and he said he had no idea. Does it?

autism,Caffeinated_EdTech,2019/02/08,"Proud mom moment/DON'T under estimate spectrum teens!! SOOOOO Let me start by saying I am the mom of a 15 yr old Aspie who is fairly obsessed with trains... We have been struggling to get him to think about his future as an adult, things like getting a job and living on his own, etc...

He has said that he would like to work in the rail industry. Not the guy driving the train but the guy fixing them or improving the trains and rail lines. My cousin is a train mechanic and that has helped him look realistically at the rail industry. 

Then completely out of left field... for his birthday he asked if he could sign up for Wildland Firefighting courses offered by the Ranger Service because he wants to explore it as a ""grown up option"" (aka a job) 

I said he could, and since he can't drive and the classes are an hour from home, this mom is ALSO taking the training, some super mom/son time for sure! The classes are EIGHT HOURS long on Saturday's and Sunday's. They are filled with ADULTS who already work at local Fire Depts or Emergency Services, plus 2 seniors from his high school.... and him and I. I thought he would be intimidated by the class length and adult presence but he has handled it AMAZINGLY WELL!!! It helps that he has me there I am sure, but he does not rely on me. I am a sped 1:1 by profession so I used a couple of tactics to keep him focused at the beginning but once the class got really going, he has been all in!!!

He is a fidget kid, so he moves quite a bit, we sat at the end of the front row. He tends to sit with one foot under his butt and then about 30 min later change and put the other foot under his butt. This was his ONLY fidget during the classes which was AMAZING btw, and was more of a comfortable position thing rather than a fidget. There was a young lady who is a college freshman sitting one seat down, and every time my son would shift position she would shoot him dirty looks, then she made a nasty comment that ""fidgety children should not be allowed to take the class"" and also ""It's not like he is learning anything anyway"" SERIOUSLY CHICK??? 1st off she is 19, just 4 yrs older than my son, and openly admitted that she will NOT be doing anything with her training and only took the class because it was free and counts as 1/2 a college credit. Secondly, he got a 100 on is S-190 Fire Behavior exam and she failed it so he IS TOO LEARNING!!! AND she skipped HALF of the first 8 hour class and the teacher was ticked off about it! 

I was biting my tongue trying to keep quiet, my son just looked at her and rolled his eyes and went back to work... but the 2 high school seniors that know my son, they went off on her. They told her that since she admits she is never going to do anything fire fighter related and HE was looking to become a fire fighter, maybe she should sit down and shut up and not distract the real learners!!! Warmed my heart to see his peers stand up for him!

Then I asked my son what inspired him to want to look into this (thinking we were finally branching away from trains...) and he gave me an answer that made my brain hurt for a moment LOL... Here is his answer: ""Well mom I want to work on trains, trains go through forests, trains have metal wheels on metal tracks and that makes sparks, sparks start fires! So they could accidentally start forest fires and I should know how they work and how they are put out so I can work on trains NOT starting them!"" WHOOSH... OK kiddo!!! But hey, even if nothing else we have been having fun training together!

autism,annharv1,2019/02/08,"Sensory crafts and activities for high schoolers Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this question is appropriate for this forum (if not, please let me know!)

I am on a leadership team on my college campus and coordinate service activities with students.  I'm partnering with an on-campus school for middle and high school students who have different needs to do a student service day.  Volunteers from the college will come in and do a variety of activities with the school's students.  Most students in the school have autism and the grades are divided into verbal and nonverbal classrooms.

However, I'm struggling with one aspect of planning.  I have prior experience working a young, nonverbal autistic student, but I'm not an education major and don't know what kind of sensory crafts/activities are developmentally appropriate for middle and high school students.  I'm also not receiving much help or feedback for coordinating these projects, so I don't have guidance I can rely on.  For those of you with autism or who have a child with autism, what kind of sensory activities would you recommend for an older age group?",9.481480787253986,10.102311103092784,9.292305529522023,59.853678537956895,59.10309278350515,12.415370196813495,42.37863167760075,11.911945987284742,5.63436701030928,910,48,133,26,11,296,104,194,0.036000000000000004,0.935,0.029,-0.0926,2,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,2,0,3,2,4,0,1,12,0,17,0,0,0,0,30,26,14,0,4,7,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,8,16,0,0,3,1,0,2,5,1,0,1,0,0,9,3,26,23,3,18,0,0,0,0,12,11,0,6,5,92,17,23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519646491550108,0.0,0.14252891994448802,0.1598415367617384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331434379451033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08483562315162801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13743649564200686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12867622207803542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08817182048537006,0.41695344910707305,0.0,0.13065383645831388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2739676869631858,0.14458735053473915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13451364418294026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09670068864608798,0.09753892839204864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913827602529227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14439687475408822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14736047178594894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6656526620260537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13751936403069034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957663047914818,0.0,0.0,0.09344577241837188,0.0,0.1598415367617384,0.0
autism,FinnsChips,2019/02/08,"I'm looking for part time work, does anyone have any tips on finding work when you're autistic? I'm 18 and still in school but I have a couple weekdays off and want to find a part time job to fill in some time I have free but I don't know where to start. I'm not the best in general when it comes to organised work, more down to schizophrenia than autism, but I've long accepted that I need to move past that, but I also struggle greatly with work involving interactions with people or food. I worked as a soccer referee when I was 14 for around 8 months and beyond that I have no experience with proper work. I am 18 as I already said, I'm male, no real preferences as long as food and prolonged social interaction aren't hugely involved because I simply can't manage with them being a part of it. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for this sort of help but I need some assistance with this, maybe you've been in this situation before and you found good work?

autism,AdministrativeMoment,2019/02/08,"A foolproof cash journal explanation Heej guys! 
I have a client for whom i do the bookkeeping of his business. 
He needs to keep a cash journal because people pay in cash as well. 

I tried to explain how such a thing works 
(beginning of the month count cash and write that down, write down per date what you got in payments / where you spend your money on, end of the month count cash and see if there is a difference).

He really did not get it. He has braindamage from a fall (and possible a little autism as well). 
But i need him, by law, to keep a cash journal. 

Any tips to make it easier? I am already contemplating to make a unique system for him but he still needs to fill out the date, the store, the amount and keep the ticket they give you when you pay for stuff. 

I am autistic as well and maybe that is in the way of me trying to get him or he trying to get me haha.

autism,Ingolin,2019/02/08,"Sheldon TBBT My post was removed from another sub so I will try here. I am sorry for bringing up a subject that may aggravate some people. I wanted to talk Sheldon. 

I know this is a subject that has been debated a lot, and that many people feel his character is detrimental to autism awareness. I know some people find him a stereotype and that it upsets them that Sheldon is the picture people think of when they hear Aspergers. 

However, does anyone else ever feel free when they watch the show? I am always so happy when I watch this show because there is finally someone who is easy to understand. I understand his motives. He is a dick at times, yes, and makes no effort to make people around him happy or to understand other people, but when I watch this show, it feels like I can relax, because there is finally someone who is easy to understand and who acts the way I find reasonable. I realize at times we are supposed to find his antics ridiculous, but I cannot help thinking how much easier the world would be if everyone was so clear cut and non duplicitous as he is.

To me he is a fresh of breath air in a world that is at times very demanding to understand.

autism,Impressive_Media,2019/02/08,"So I was banned from r/TooAfraidToAsk because I made a post about autism I had asked if peta would approve of autistic people, considering that they're basically animals. I mean, animals may function better, because they don't drool in the corner of a basement all day, but still, I don't think that ban was justified, let alone nice.

autism,hiduckiee,2019/02/09,"My 3 years old has been maybe diagnosed with mild autism I say that because they didn’t complete the test and didn’t take my portion of questions and diagnosed him. The girl who tested him was extremely mean and boring so he didn’t want to play or be near her so she cut the test an 1.5 hrs before (he had 20 mins of testing). We are getting him tested by someone else and have definitely contacted the office and her superiors and we weren’t the only ones who filed a complaint about how she acted and how she cut the test or came up with the diagnosis. However, i know my little one could be or is just very speech delayed. He seemed to grow out of or stopped certain behaviors that made his first pediatrician think he could be (she was very confused, he didn’t seem like he was but he didn’t seem like he wasn’t- her exact words) and after a couple months of speech therapy he’s saying words while signing or just simply relating random words he hears, sees, or remembers. 

My question i guess is: if my son is diagnosed with mild autism what should i expect in his behavior for the future if he is diagnosed with mild autism? Are there any of you who have mild autism that can tell me about your behavior socially? I just want to know how to be there for him properly and how to guide him. I will definitely let my son know he’s artistic when we get an accurate diagnosis but i have only read from some research about children, teens, &amp; adults who are moderately to severely autism or have Aspergers and he just doesn’t fit that so it’s hard to find guidance for him.
 We have another baby coming at the end June so we also want to know how he could possibly react. He’s such a great kid and such a sweet loving boy and from what I’ve seen he loves the kids in his class at school. He used to HATE i mean HATE learning but now it’s one of his favorite parts of the day besides story time, reading, and going to the library.

autism,Nootrophic,2019/02/09,"Aspies welcomed here? 40 yo, after 30 years of research/tests, got my dx yesterday. What now? I feel like NEO just after being unplugged from the Matrix. I though this dx would relieve me and explain everything at last. Catharsis. But no, even knowing things are about to get better for me, I have this strange anxiety/depression that I never met before .. as if my unconscious was freaking out without my consciousness getting much hint about what this is about. I know I feel like yelling my dx to the whole world (and proudly too because I LOVE WHAT I AM. Amor Fati) but have almost no one to tell and they all reacted like I told them I got dx'ed a cold. 

I know it's temporary and I'll adapt, but if anyone feel like telling me anything at all, please do.  &lt;3",3.0124489795918383,5.3407526598639485,3.4356122448979605,89.13260204081635,76.82312925170069,6.37687074829932,26.8265306122449,7.447530270364453,1.4708040816326529,599,24,116,8,14,186,102,147,0.098,0.732,0.17,0.88,0,0,0,0,1,0,24.0,0,0,2,2,9,11,0,0,3,0,9,4,0,1,3,26,23,11,0,3,7,0,3,4,0,1,3,1,0,0,9,5,0,0,8,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,5,5,20,10,16,16,4,11,0,0,0,1,9,4,0,3,11,80,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1672101052097565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675892080122095,0.0,0.13741339858974558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10179174431830704,0.0,0.1420908726024443,0.0,0.0,0.14768355738255148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14382285948158255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11029119223633987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15007422762852882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25329600441211736,0.3578796738170779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17448423510191213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671043188008139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753097065486459,0.13611404354893533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32631930295854755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507093541600414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12275226989426938,0.0,0.128788162481578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11315251080178546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832980135909293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919023158025484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11093658388054962,0.0,0.16406068688330616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15956012937842695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864313939177613,0.0,0.16096637649585324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11862046524156275,0.0,0.0,0.1075320604397281
autism,AndThenThereWasQueso,2019/02/09,[Massachusetts] My nephew's mom just found out he is on the spectrum. He is 3yrs 8mos. I was an ABA therapist for around 5 years but have since moved out of state.  My nephew's mom has little resources and is in a pretty bad space right now.  I am trying to assist her from afar.  She is frustrated with the daycare provider who doesn't know how to deal with my nephew and often makes her come pick him up early or make him sit in the office for hours.  He is aggressive towards other children (pushing) and engages in self harm such as hair pulling and biting his own arm.  She will be trying to get him into public preschool next year and thus receive an IEP and school based services.  Most of the autism day providers in her area have a 6 month wait list.  Are there any rules that apply when it comes to private daycare centers and children with autism?,5.2675629791894885,6.147625789156628,4.583406352683465,89.08037787513693,68.21686746987952,7.000219058050384,27.74151150054764,6.574015621080383,1.0762120481927708,675,21,136,4,11,201,121,166,0.092,0.8690000000000001,0.039,-0.8807,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,0,9,5,2,0,8,0,14,2,2,5,0,29,22,12,0,0,3,5,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,4,16,0,1,2,0,0,6,1,4,0,0,2,1,14,1,24,18,2,33,0,0,0,0,24,16,0,3,9,82,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247209537683064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16326837135368635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1531346111606557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159724721898428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11828035480484515,0.18908138673440072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20109293018814814,0.0,0.0,0.09582097769863718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18061591581641476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10079399718073076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18381890827512964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24484707950695295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296009054400816,0.14639125797120447,0.1949293403392384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1950521479967764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18658772001333104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566259442969626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18561455698983773,0.0,0.0,0.1913302859037983,0.0,0.0,0.15171361662694896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21294608523421293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24903844342412915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362122207605855

autism,PM_Me_Whatever_Idek,2019/02/09,"Question about job applications. So, I'm about to finish nursing school as a psychiatric nurse and it's about time for me to start applying to jobs.

My question to you guys is if you think I should tell people that I have autism when I'm doing job interviews. On the one hand I realise that this might hurt my chances at getting a job, but on the other hand I find that my autism has can actually be an asset in working with cliënts in psychiatry. I've had it happen that cliënts do something that seems strange or odd to the staff nurses and that I understand perfectly why the cliënt did what they did. I've had this happen more than once.

So I'm really conflicted about this and I wanted to hear what you guys thought.",5.486192696192696,6.020934853146857,5.624848484848485,83.03505050505049,67.6013986013986,9.152758352758351,30.574203574203572,9.150863307647796,2.3639998445998445,576,21,117,10,9,182,90,143,0.051,0.833,0.116,0.8885,4,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,3,1,2,7,2,0,0,7,0,13,2,2,0,1,19,26,10,0,3,3,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,2,14,4,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,3,14,1,19,18,1,9,0,1,0,0,11,5,0,6,4,78,28,8,0.0,0.0,0.14748624900789628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13813492403368818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07896195515896784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2992954123237514,0.2672968892147046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17034046466538513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16179346202212266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5999138495576942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1603306671265295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609541595077824,0.10241318912091553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477818570335644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386122446810523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09682114173494487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15295698998165935,0.0,0.13758789876400493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11635133595744028,0.0,0.0,0.1069743415877436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13209891173112126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09684139617815636,0.0,0.11998454438216816,0.08812820747567911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15733717495850233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08914351435281287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13637609856536154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11002829672450022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,pixel_kittyx,2019/02/09,"My parents just told me ""the secret"" Please remove if this isn't allowed I'm new here :) 

Hi, I'm 23F and my parents just told me one of the family secrets (that they're best friends know about too) is that I'm on the spectrum but that they didn't get me diagnosed because I was a good kid with good grades. Apparently it wasn't until high school/college where the obsessive behaviour, need for routine and other things became more of a red flag so they researched it and spoke to family friends with boys with ASD confirming to themselves that I'm autistic. 

Now I work in admin for children's social care so I already knew I ticked boxes but thought it was just me over thinking, however I'm now slightly mindblown to have it ""confirmed"" and would like to know how I can go about getting a formal test at my age in the UK? Apologies if this isn't the right place just feeling the need to reach out a bit.

Tldr: 23f parents told me i have autism but never had me tested because it wasn't a thing for girls and I had good grades.

autism,awsomejwags,2019/02/09,I get embarrassing meltdowns in front of my fiancee and I don’t think she understands what it’s like for me not to have control of my emotions or yelling I just had a bad meltdown in front of my partner because I was grumpy earlier and she decided to “make plans to study” after school because of it. When I asked her who she was studying with her only answer was “some people” this caused me to have a complete meltdown that lasted over 20 minutes because she laughed about it and said “why are you yelling- this makes me wanna leave more” I then calmed down but the meltdown started up for 15 more minutes. I now have no voice and I bruised up my own leg badly. How can I explain to my parter than I have absolutely no control or reasoning when I have meltdowns and the best thing for her to do is calm me down even if she was upset with me before. It’s humiliating and I hate myself when I have meltdowns even if they are rare. ,4.3865880893300275,5.429387112903229,4.835161290322585,85.8804342431762,70.34408602150539,7.228453267162945,30.974358974358978,7.321109707123232,1.7876224979321758,737,31,149,7,13,234,108,186,0.134,0.7909999999999999,0.07400000000000001,-0.8936,0,0,0,0,2,0,6.0,0,1,1,4,9,10,1,2,4,0,17,1,1,7,0,29,27,16,0,3,7,0,0,1,2,0,0,4,0,1,10,8,0,2,6,0,0,2,4,5,0,0,6,4,34,5,26,21,5,17,0,0,0,0,16,7,0,5,9,119,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16688806893713762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2981062830765825,0.32646451651912145,0.0,0.1519037008243059,0.0,0.18734119933353965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833847843411548,0.0,0.0,0.1871703007867003,0.0,0.4004410435876755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20080611964481607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23581585449052664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326707818044172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17624728210269253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14551411058677907,0.0,0.18902233626666715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08721374719912611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383212137372357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13576922373165265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12376029972821567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1835438573641615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16980929744667347,0.0,0.0,0.1806674051338288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12635432164868618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11859788978431285,0.11438564369724127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18584112523558605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16108264063664887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,ParthenaSLW,2019/02/09,"Does anyone else find it hard to connect things? I'm not sure if I'm writing this correctly. I'm hoping someone understands what I mean.

Basically, do you struggle to put 2 and 2 together? 

Examples: You can correctly figure out how to do the pattern to a math problem, but have trouble figuring out what pattern goes to what problem?
Or if you are watching a movie, you can't seem to figure out the motives of a character (even if it's insanely obvious to your neurotypical friends) you just seem to not be able to connect those feelings to their motives.

If so, has anyone found a way to overcome this? It doesn't have to be in math but in any aspect of life.

I am able to have one part of something figured out and another. I just struggle to connect those parts together.

autism,YadiJavadi,2019/02/10,"How do Autistic People Strategize? I'm a poker theorist who recently spent 5 years mapping out how we naturally think through a poker decision. I've mapped out how we naturally strategize and I'm hoping you can help me understand which sections of this strategic thought process autistic people struggle with.

My sister is heavily autistic, and I honestly believe that my findings about the mind could make it easier to treat people like her.

This thought process works in levels.

- At Level One you have the self, the strength of our attributes.
- At Level two we have the ""opponent"" (or any external object). To make a decision at this level you basically compare your strength to that of the opponents. Strategies at this level are all in reaction to the opponents strength. If the opponent is strong, we might react by running away.I
- At Level three we require empathy. We put ourselves in the shoes of the opponent so that we can see things from his perspective. This enables us to gage his reaction to our actions granting us an element of control over said actions. Empathy is also essential if you want to deceive your opponent. 
- Level Four is the last of these levels, we use it to defend against our opponents attempts to control or deceive us.

When someone first learns the rules to poker they are able to use these levels subconsciously. As they get better, they develop their conscious ability to use these levels. If they trust in imperfect strategies, it becomes harder for them to consciously recognise the levels.

Using this as a guide, I don't suppose any of you are able to tell me which sections of that thought-process Autistic people struggle with or find easy???",6.464536037350456,8.651178097315437,6.3314998540998,72.74587540122558,66.68456375838926,9.343682521155527,38.45987744382842,9.761364909221204,4.362538488473884,1355,76,205,31,23,426,154,298,0.038,0.821,0.141,0.9849,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,14,7,6,15,7,12,0,2,17,0,15,1,1,13,1,51,33,16,0,6,6,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,20,14,0,3,11,3,1,4,1,2,0,5,4,2,36,10,44,27,3,36,0,0,1,0,36,27,0,8,6,154,56,3,0.22312608052891952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08921692299287219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15173338607898934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10481714875917364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232126129091752,0.0,0.12569334261617734,0.0,0.09866844303961164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25025487210890784,0.0890740096839635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20393319533365892,0.09489546505694392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0582870839435009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07477835424130748,0.0,0.0,0.11080727166438342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09093876793616627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05450406620638338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14893839135546394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183507555595294,0.11264686761928115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07559800335737363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093750600903482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11215166938426603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11015504319569236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061219989706586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890129897525928,0.0,0.11638458199083195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945270019803272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2332598252348111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09751101453118613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411752670118407,0.07148509148333773,0.0,0.26570577677236795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898087959460448,0.11614105939723528,0.4025898031299071,0.3854185876428641,0.0,0.0,0.0658027716466817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08121922202192343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07184294019235847

autism,ugly_convention,2019/02/10,"Looking for feedback! As some of you may know the Ontario provincial government has overhauled the Ontario autism program. I am part of a few groups on Facebook that are mobilizing to protest at queens park (government office) in the coming weeks. I am seeking feedback on this post I plan on using to garner support through my Facebook to get families of those who will be affected by the changes into the game and interested in what is happening. 
-

The Ontario Autism Program has taken a drastic hit in the most recent effort to reduce the provincial deficit. Through his regular backdoor politics, Doug Ford has ensured the average person is distracted by large dollar values for much needed services when the reality is that he has once again undercut a vulnerable population. 1 in 6 children are diagnosed with Autism in this province. There is an astonishing 32000+ children requiring autism services; many have been languishing on government created waitlists for years. These children are waiting for diagnosis and treatment plans as well as funding allocation. Currently 8000 children are receiving some funding to offset the cost of treatments such as IBI therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. This funding does not always cover the entire cost of treatment, and requires a great deal of resources to initiate and sustain for just one year let alone for the entirety of an individuals’ childhood. The PC government has proposed that it is unethical to allow just 8000 children funding for treatment and are now re-allocating all of these funds to every child in need. #Clearthewaitlist 

The conservatives have pledged about $300 million for autism related services in the next fiscal year. Up to $140,000 will be available to children who enter the new program before the age of five. $55,000 for those entering after age seven. Cheques will be made directly to the parents for them to find and pay for the services themselves. For a person who has no knowledge of autism, behaviour services, or families in this position, the proposed plan by the conservatives appears to take a concentrated effort to move those waiting off of endless lists and gives parents the financial power to seek effective treatment. The sad reality is that the conservatives have effectively re-allocated previously designated funds and now placed the burden of finding less than adequate care back on struggling families in the province. They have removed the position of the Child Advocate while conveniently imposing a no appeal age based funding allocation. 

A breakdown of the proposed funds: a seven year old in the new system is entitled to $55,000 (Max) to be dispersed from the time they are seven until they are eighteen, with a yearly cap of $5000. This equates to $13.40 a day. That is only if they meet the maximum benefit guidelines and if they are in great need of developmental services. A three year old could receive $140000 lifetime with a yearly cap of $22000. This is significantly more than their older counterparts with a daily total of $60. Again; only if they meet the maximum benefit guidelines and are of significant developmental and behavioral need. 

In what reality is $13.40 a day going to provide for ethically sourced, scientifically researched, and educationally backed therapeutic intervention? 

My family has been navigating the confusing and stressful autism program for about a year now. My son is one of the lucky ones that was diagnosed and accepted into the previous Ontario Autism Program. We waited just 6 months for an autism diagnosis. Another 3 months before we met with anyone from the Ontario Autism Program. We were told in September that we were “next” in line to undergo diagnostic testing for eligibility into the Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention program and to expect an appointment in the new year. In January we were told again that we were “next” and because school planning was to begin soon, diagnostic testing would ideally be complete to have a better understanding of my sons needs. We met again recently in hopes that at the beginning of the new fiscal year (April 1st) Owen would have his first appointment with a psychometrist. At that time we were informed that Ford had put a “freeze” on new funding in preparation for his announcement regarding the changes to the Autism Program by Minister of Children, Community, and Social Service Lisa MaCleod. The announcement made on Wednesday has put these plans in jeopardy and it is unknown if Owen will have the opportunity to undergo testing let alone receive funding for this life changing program. In the meantime we are left to decide how to position ourselves financially to ensure Owen receives the best therapies while hoping for direction and assistance from the province.
  
Owen is non-verbal. His communication skills will require a great deal of therapy from a certified Speech Language Pathologist and Communicative Disorder Assistants. Last year alone our family spent $3000 on twice weekly half hour visits with our CDA. We are exceptionally privileged in that our benefits are able to offset the cost however the bulk of these payments do come from our own pockets. While we are on a government waitlist for speech related services, we continue to pay for a private SLP and CDA. Although the government speech program is not contingent on the autism funding, the cost of just one hour of speech therapy gives insight into the immense cost of Intensive Behavioural Therapy which should occur for 20-30 hours a week to be effective and to see real strides and change. Applied Behavioural Analysis is currently the only thoroughly researched, scientifically proven, evidence based practice to assists young children on the autism spectrum in reaching their full potential. The changes to the Ontario Autism Program will see less than adequate funding for this treatment, leaving many families unable to afford even a subclinical amount of therapy.
 
Families of those with Autism are uniting in sending a message to Doug Ford and the entire Conservative party that the imposed changes to the Ontario Autism Program are largely inadequate. We demand equitable funding for clinically appropriate evidence based treatments that are provided by regulated professionals",12.669067951157633,11.749263389153187,11.328632849666985,52.84079576990172,53.54804947668888,14.695535997462736,50.915814303837614,13.427899808715575,7.2720727719632094,5166,305,691,156,48,1637,449,1051,0.049,0.868,0.083,0.9895,11,3,0,0,0,0,94.0,17,1,9,21,22,26,1,4,92,0,78,4,0,9,2,115,116,41,0,17,12,4,1,0,0,10,4,5,0,12,38,52,0,10,12,1,23,16,4,7,1,13,18,9,38,19,166,78,15,131,0,1,3,0,72,46,0,14,67,497,76,42,0.04876433965244635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1515154479737144,0.0,0.0,0.04057583702063715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051133661966690384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03409716011236216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499353429936381,0.0,0.02972628883789453,0.0,0.08298972276181117,0.0,0.051175165944567766,0.043128095630560366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049718494248540704,0.0,0.309517232589585,0.08401232144172402,0.05112848234520306,0.0,0.0,0.03893435722204703,0.0,0.0,0.06289792980532466,0.100547785893407,0.0,0.0989895565318948,0.0,0.0,0.05588815798596302,0.0,0.04267400224694172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032208386433000245,0.0,0.04108605934590946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217947565646605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913944600367144,0.041478922397096406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02547735479450717,0.0935583960988038,0.027713897999133544,0.0,0.0,0.16128856986019224,0.0,0.0,0.04312214450795347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09686798456897634,0.14406915518839727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02679960577532864,0.039749445306457055,0.0,0.05163439467713913,0.05298259771491511,0.09972968235943976,0.03444369522937685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040949763695280916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228399450310143,0.0,0.09887877308364676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07784646134328993,0.05182877573323538,0.0358474005413814,0.18079069980792412,0.0,0.23548451553083266,0.15558428531924506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233994284074976,0.051932430233976416,0.1321759143181091,0.11126243313296497,0.0,0.0,0.10829405662703934,0.052807027793390776,0.0,0.0,0.08515828091250507,0.05094835597618208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04670275767853406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09804326030339383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055504494397079315,0.0,0.0,0.09629780486604156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049352115132119186,0.07771773032532311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04970910323757097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05585938631437177,0.0509790756780058,0.0,0.0,0.05533719475402663,0.0,0.0,0.03666471462169052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44613017797531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05686975720754595,0.0,0.0,0.09319283257555687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05076539734500175,0.0,0.04211673254787173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11734743554870496,0.0,0.043844997709309316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06928157554368489,0.0,0.0,0.34542899527947674

autism,Sophophilie,2019/02/11,"I (27m) need some advice how to proceed Hello everyone,

in case I break the rules with my post, sorry, in case I don't please hear me.

I am a 27 year old guy (although I personally identify as non-binary) who is now looking for some answers for two years now. I struggled hard at school while privately pursuing my interests such as philisophy, spirituality, languages, music and many other things.
Some people say I am gifted, I on the other hand can't tell. There are things which are very easy for my mind to grasp, but I feel helpless when it comes to certain social situations or doing official things like dealing with my bank or insurance.
My social problems include group activities at high volume, dealing with aggressive behaviour or basically working with others who I experience slower and less precise in their thought process.

I made an IQ-Test two years ago after finally acknowledging that there is a nameless difference between me and the majority of people around me. The result was 118, but this alone does not explain the problems I am facing since let's say school.

I am writing this because I need a name for this difference I feel. An objective one. Not something my mind can make up until I see inconsistencies in it.
As far as I can tell it is not illogical to assume that I am on the spectrum, but who am I to say this?

I know you can't diagnose me, and I am not asking for it. Truth be told, I don't know what I am asking for. 

Any support you see as appropriate is very welcome.",6.120723964382499,6.784879634146343,7.115441347270617,72.44720770421992,66.24738675958189,10.140843979868373,34.06291134339915,10.125756701596842,3.5230017034456065,1193,52,214,27,18,401,164,287,0.076,0.843,0.081,0.4819,1,1,1,0,0,0,34.0,0,2,1,1,8,11,1,1,11,0,24,3,2,4,3,48,43,20,0,4,10,0,4,1,0,0,1,4,0,2,21,10,0,0,10,0,1,1,8,5,0,3,4,11,36,6,34,37,5,28,0,1,3,0,27,12,0,7,14,156,57,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022909865280684,0.09279150798273922,0.0,0.0,0.10841574647189704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07118522555599477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09318639322276807,0.1957212376827913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0638112714703255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901715831331101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21583865030623176,0.0,0.10624685609142576,0.0,0.21873429218776333,0.0,0.0,0.09160519017205884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10002515233227906,0.0,0.10239602743855124,0.0,0.0,0.10585757033070432,0.0,0.0,0.11467059245307185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10364854524351527,0.0,0.0,0.09377171224396393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11798070155230694,0.0,0.0,0.11059898020494292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11505754578063393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704124334846313,0.0,0.05114081148364387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08790389214257292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990496838962378,0.06987396285393925,0.10612795068871764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21139164917812853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552361209657234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098428719185388,0.0,0.07093311577158122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14514230521729854,0.09140155723587773,0.0,0.11490597183055258,0.0,0.0,0.1002534276945701,0.0,0.0,0.200327095082302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2497345320905935,0.0,0.2118812229474032,0.16683102337096173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659144829478904,0.11766344296703972,0.0,0.21341386397318912,0.0,0.08058691321391273,0.0,0.11717943196432515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094330898530657,0.0,0.0,0.11878834845855485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829879037954862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20863198240878786,0.0,0.0,0.08310333513208222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10002515233227906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2045121036498601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17274207180761342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07620746875184406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20222929314461704
autism,imaginearagog,2019/02/11,"Autistic redditors, should we find a cure for severe autism or certain aspects of it? I know a lot of people with ASD who are vehemently against the idea of curing autism. But most of these people are high functioning. There are people with autism who cannot speak, cannot take care of themselves, cause self-harm and harm to others. Should we try to find a cure for this level of autism? Should we medicate them so they don’t bash their heads against a wall? At what point is treatment ableist because we are changing who they are?",5.603592644978787,6.89053971287129,4.524271570014147,88.32465346534653,67.7128712871287,7.355586987270155,28.289957567185287,7.447530270364453,1.4143878359264497,425,14,83,4,7,124,67,101,0.097,0.882,0.021,-0.8219,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,4,0,4,0,2,3,0,0,5,0,12,2,1,1,1,20,15,4,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,8,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,1,9,2,15,12,2,5,0,0,0,0,12,5,0,3,0,56,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13295818076224794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22237826529820087,0.22405963960909364,0.2307320656142355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986982243035431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22384437261564288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304457952862989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24622028820420575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11986786673790208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18542980930411754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21972345572063226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4536312255344683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20618499088281936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2275368956002239,0.24640286458091146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16399200656533222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14808276179112065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,anaisheaven,2019/02/11,"My boyfriend has autism and he can be a dick sometimes Hello! My “boyfriend” [25M] and I [21F] have been together for almost a year and known each other for about 2-3 years. I put parenthesis because we are currently broken up due to long distance but are still committed to being together when I move closer after college. Another thing: we’ve never met! *gasp* Although he knows my family and friends and is a huge part of my life!

So when we first met he really hated his autism being brought up at all. He didn’t really want to identify with it. He was diagnosed very late in life and he is pretty high-functioning. Along the way of us dating he began to be much more comfortable identifying with it but it has made some things very confusing for me. Things that would cause us to fight and I normally just contributed to him being a dick, he is now saying are caused by his autism. My ex was bipolar, so I understand the concept that some people cannot control certain actions or behaviors but where do I draw the line? I have spoken to people I know who have experience dealing with autism and they’ve advised me to be patient and not take things personally but does that apply to EVERYTHING? Sometimes he can be really mean... is that always the autism or is he just being a dick? I want to be sensitive and supportive, but also I think I deserve to tell him when I feel his actions are hurtful.

I read a confession from a SO to someone with autism and they said that some of the things that you experience can seem emotionally abusive if looked at from an objective standpoint and I feel like I can relate to that. So my question is how can I tell the difference between his behaviors that come from autism and his behaviors that come from him just being a dick, and if they stem from his autism but are still hurtful then do I have the right to say something and how should I go about that?

Also, “talk to him about all of it” is pretty much the clear answer but he gets overwhelmed and seems annoyed when I try to communicate about serious issues like this. (ONCE AGAIN IS THAT BC OF THE AUTISM OR IS HE JUST BEING AVOIDANT???)

tl;dr my boyfriend has autism but he can also be a dick. i’m having a hard time navigating if i should treat them as two separate occurrences or as one in the same",4.1223585810163,5.809697496644298,4.860208373282202,82.96461744966444,71.79642058165548,8.419533397251518,27.312815596037073,9.002800196639251,2.1730450495365936,1819,65,352,37,35,586,210,447,0.124,0.784,0.092,-0.9605,2,1,1,0,1,0,41.0,4,1,3,2,26,16,3,3,21,0,50,9,5,6,6,84,76,48,0,9,20,1,3,2,1,3,4,3,0,1,23,26,0,2,13,1,0,8,4,9,0,3,10,7,47,7,49,51,11,40,1,3,1,5,49,10,5,15,23,261,70,3,0.0,0.10828917016026067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09151976962089173,0.0,0.0,0.2192677516355834,0.07604869199327573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09583654694332792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05571407886882067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877774855361901,0.0,0.1574589121528717,0.0,0.0,0.10250824862669204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422513694695277,0.0,0.09276489221178873,0.0,0.09548923979623178,0.0,0.0,0.07998114866607542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280806110128518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214072182639125,0.17880541218233992,0.0861598996698818,0.0,0.0924250040215741,0.06529323344154711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774128706169171,0.0,0.0,0.07061222855694346,0.0,0.04775057398287179,0.0,0.051942383635788576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08187275462853134,0.09023450769029802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656476299512126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19568235519697366,0.0,0.0,0.09539355114478017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045756858263216,0.0,0.10309853120810662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911122293185953,0.08930281872663304,0.0,0.0,0.08088247589089262,0.07674951880539031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08648098953948956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09955690466506456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09713935414618068,0.13437297281850585,0.0,0.07049013542229536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08954855517072671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973336271366938,0.0619322122165654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897282931458463,0.0,0.1267247878588269,0.07980335528874145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859649304938923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09187810101165812,0.10238430018986516,0.0,0.09142061093379633,0.0,0.17565161914543334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07805158035760305,0.08693840933903331,0.14536334095389114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664067493225524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743943076335642,0.07036101201466685,0.1807857204815192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14597773232156347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371495916351653,0.0,0.0,0.06871832583190199,0.07346054465072778,0.15976805146161244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3035968007597493,0.058562788161717276,0.0,0.0,0.05329367139622253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062051801718739086,0.0,0.08928049237880678,0.09514633215434952,0.219875975699163,0.0,0.0,0.15082234205485834,0.10781531355518237,0.07254579375799433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06492500939229942,0.0,0.0,0.11771189768654595
autism,TaysTransAlt,2019/02/11,"Questions and concerns about being trans and autistic I want to transition and start HRT as soon as possible, but I'm worried that having breasts or having to wear a bra might cause sensory issues for me, or maybe it won't, I can't know for sure since I don't have any experience with having breasts and have no idea what having them is like. I'm kinda concerned because even simple things like wearing certain jeans and certain kinds of socks causes sensory issues for me.

autism,QueenSephy,2019/02/11,"Question about over eating Does anyone here over eat or binge eat because you simply want to chew or are orally seeking stimulation? 

I am wondering if that is a ""thing"".  My daughter is 11. She is a moderately functioning autistic.  Her executive functioning skills just aren't there. 

I'm very concerned about her because in the past year she has gained like 30 lbs. She is hitting the pubertal growth spurt and is 5'0"" tall. I think she may just be eating to chew. She also hides food and steals it from others like my dad. Then later I find twenty wrappers under the bed or dresser...

Ideas?

autism,robotdevilhands,2019/02/11,"How to deal with ignorant idiots? My 3 year old son is autistic, nonvocal. He likes to click his tongue, flap his hands, and make odd faces. He doesn’t enjoy socializing with peers or strange adults.

However, we have a tight-knit group of friends, all of whom he knows well, and he loves parties. One friend threw a Super Bowl party, and we attended as a family.

While we were there, I noticed a friend of a friend staring judgementally at my son as he stimmed. I gave her the Look of Death, and she made a point of looking away.

This same friend-of-friend’s husband has previously made comments about “paying people on the spectrum less, because 🙄.”

Obviously, they are morons. I can’t believe that in this era of increased autism awareness, my son still has to deal with jackasses like this.

However, we do have to see them socially on occasion. Any recommendations on helping them become less ignorant/assholish?

Thank you.",4.89442857142857,7.045955770588236,4.971596638655463,81.04647058823531,70.70588235294117,8.38655462184874,30.378151260504197,9.04235418022936,2.6694621848739497,731,31,133,15,14,228,118,170,0.085,0.69,0.226,0.9776,2,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,4,1,3,1,5,14,2,0,8,0,10,3,2,4,2,21,21,9,1,0,1,4,1,2,4,0,0,0,0,1,5,11,0,1,1,0,1,3,2,3,1,1,5,6,18,11,22,16,5,15,0,0,5,1,36,7,0,1,7,78,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436398197885304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13037293626910004,0.0,0.0,0.08458898070551105,0.15325345442533134,0.0,0.15633901837951736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2861182829548821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13081393857241155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6432503123355895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093010291991528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07626082583691739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13558573638094168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23305289065883256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12523953427224066,0.2626028789876764,0.09262575653923594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15798323742225834,0.14560901795658585,0.0,0.09402978224896134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09620118337000154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13117642040199276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11057659479148252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2829039573410113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11081676152141658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12775484633082798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476510894081155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08935918572449597

autism,CharlieChowder,2019/02/11,"Seeking advice about son's fixation on urinating and penis pain My son is 7. 6 months ago he was in pain at the top of his penis, burning/stinging sensation. I took him to the doctor and she said he may not be getting it dry after urinating and it is irritating the skin. He was also swimming slot at that time and I think the chlorine may also irritate that area because he would complain around swimming time more frequently.
The doctor suggested getting the penis dry after urinating and putting Neosporin on the site until the pain goes away.

Ever since then, my son has a compulsive need for medicine on his penis. I have a small jar of coconut oil in the bathroom for him to apply. But now he wants it at school and at the pool. He also is scared that his penis will ""leak"" after peeing. It takes him a long time to urinate now because he wants to make sure everything last drop is out and for the next few minutes after that he is panicky that more (even a drop) will come out. 

I have now shown him diagrams about his body to explain how urinating works and told him he can have medicine (coconut oil) once a day in the morning. This is starting to affect him at school and in public with too many trips to the bathroom and asking teachers and nurses for medicine for his penis, in front of peers.

Any first hand advise or from parents is greatly appreciated.

 I also want to note, he has incredible bladder and bowel control and has never had an accident after potty training (lucky me )

Thank you for your time!

autism,ErinKR39,2019/02/11,"I require your assistance I am currently writing a letter to my school (and possibly to my local education authority) in order to help students with autism get better support at school. I am doing this because my school currently doesn’t have anything in place for autistic students and I know that many people on this subreddit have had problems with school and autism, and I want to make sure that autistic students are provided with the help that they need.

I can only speak from my own experience; I know that everyone here has had a very different experience from me. If you have any opinions to share, whether it’s a story of something that has happened to you or your child or friend in school, or an idea that could help make school better for autistic students and their peers and teachers, please let me know. I would love to hear as many opinions as possible.

autism,you_have_time,2019/02/11,"Are theraspecs any good for light sensitivity? Hi, I'm a late diagnosed HFA (in my 30's) and I have to say that sensory sensitivities are my biggest problem (after years of honing social mirroring I'm not doing too bad in that respect, and I've almost automated my normal social skills)

Smell is my main issue (but mainly on public transport, in the office it's not too bad as I have considerate coworkers) sound is second (full ear covering headphones for the win) but the pervasive issue of bright fluorescence lights is having an effect on me too and I'm looking into some fluorescent light minimising eye wear right now.


Theraspecs came up in my search and I was wondering if anyone else has similar fluro light sensitivity and has tried them? Or if you can advise on a similar product that's worked for you?

Thanks in advance for any help :-)

autism,Bagles-And-Chi,2019/02/11,"Advice on working with autism in a child I am a direct care provider for an autistic 8 year old and I absolutely love him. This is my first and only client so I am slightly new. Though one of my closest high school friends was autistic, and I’ve been around other learning disabilities seeing how my dad is in the same type of field, he is the first child with autism that had issues chewing and spitting out his toothpaste when he brushes his teeth. (It’s just I’ve never had to help feed or cleans my old friends, so it’s a learning experience,  and I want to make sure he’s taken care of how he should be) He doesn’t get much of a variety at meal time but he does get all his nutrients in the few things he eats. What are some good nutrition filled recipes that require no chewing? And how do I get him to spit out his toothpaste? I don’t want him to hurt his stomach. Doing that kind of gives me an upset tummy and he’s so little I don’t know. Maybe some advice from someone else who is autistic or from someone else who works with autism can help me out ",3.4966877880184333,4.669974599078343,4.000757488479263,90.53542194700458,72.59447004608296,6.53099078341014,26.465725806451612,6.6274283507984215,0.8887790322580646,836,28,180,6,16,263,123,217,0.071,0.8390000000000001,0.09,-0.1355,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,5,10,10,0,1,9,0,19,10,4,4,3,35,32,18,0,3,4,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,11,14,5,1,3,0,0,1,5,2,0,3,5,2,21,8,24,25,6,22,0,1,1,1,27,12,0,4,9,114,32,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707508410093937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12332608762539107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824926283806126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12123346895820933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417565414609506,0.23145749535677101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13551443526943285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2356766830422494,0.0,0.0,0.2140645780062224,0.0,0.21713745645958432,0.13289600590529388,0.0,0.1161971190042317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18571503369917966,0.14637050595387902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14830526399093827,0.0,0.0,0.14459521167679093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442635468360796,0.07613556272632936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1388491022552882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250338206117948,0.0,0.0924736130204982,0.0,0.13917766718378036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10183963284290994,0.0,0.10684722321578212,0.1337985808715288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2907396923253927,0.0,0.09387533253138804,0.1053625941104601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14020546006604132,0.1103949659136176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23476159025390106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13056819777212064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920369210359448,0.0,0.136110559344789,0.0,0.0807812436385203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16342381532532166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20171118645040306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08921240774981996

autism,jshonest,2019/02/11,"Teacher intimidates and follows me home So we live across the street from my child’s pre-school.  There has been a few incidences against my son at the school and I have advised of their violation on multiple occasions of the human rights code.  Well, I dropped my kid off and had to rush home to take a conference.  One of the lead teachers, whom I’ve never met before, specifically came into the classroom that day and asked to speak with me.  Basically she was waiting all morning waiting for me to drop off my son to his classroom.  She asked to speak with me, and I told her I had to leave for a meeting and I had no time this morning.  She then proceeded to follow me out of the building and said she will talk to me while I head to my car.  I told her I walked to the school.   I told her she needs to talk to my son’s lawyer because I am not talking to her. I proceeded to walk home quickly, but she followed me home.  I even made sure to walk in a different direction home so that security cameras to my townhouse would pick her up following me.  I’m so rattled...my son’s lawyer said he couldn’t help because the action was on me not my son.    I’m thinking this mist be wrong to intimidate someone knowing that they fully are aware that I have filed a suit against the school. 

Is this action criminal? What can I do besides file a complaint to the certification board for this teacher. 

Oh...and this teacher they sent to talk to me is over 6 feet and well over 200 pounds.  Definitely bigger than me.

autism,JVerose,2019/02/12,"Question About ABA Therapy So… My question isn’t about ABA therapy directly.

My DVR career counselor wants me to have a therapist I can talk to to manage anxiety during my first semester of college. It was also a recommendation from the doctor who diagnosed me.

I agreed but said it has to be somebody who specializes or at least has experience working with autistic adults, because trying to treat my anxiety with traditional methods has never worked in the past. Trying to fix it as if I’m not autistic is not going to help, so.

My DVR counselor found a therapist for me who came recommended but… she’s an ABA therapist. They gave me some info about her and she got her degree in ABA in the early 80s. She now works as a licensed family and marriage counselor who also does ABA for autistic kids. My initial reaction is not to trust this. It doesn’t sit right with me. I’m not sure if I should agree to give her a chance or not, but here’s what the info says about her approach:

* All children can learn.

* Parents know their children best and are their child’s primary therapist.

* ABA programs must be developmentally sequenced.

* Behavior is communication; we need to understand what a child is trying to tell us.

* Treatment activities should be child led; we can find learning opportunities anywhere that a child wants to be.

* A child will not be motivated to work with us or learn if we do not honor their preferences.

* Children with ASD need to learn to sometimes cooperate with the agenda of others, and there needs to be motivation for them to do so.

I know that doesn’t pertain to me because I’m obviously an adult and I’d be there for counseling but… Idk thoughts?",3.7073647325569397,6.34742413099042,4.8979016798928185,77.93054416159953,76.06070287539936,8.000371019272391,29.266103267030807,8.841846274778883,2.7607844790271048,1335,60,235,31,31,439,158,313,0.064,0.857,0.079,0.7786,1,0,1,0,0,0,32.0,5,0,5,10,12,7,0,0,15,0,29,2,0,3,5,61,48,19,0,12,15,1,0,0,0,4,2,2,0,11,14,15,0,0,17,0,0,4,11,0,0,1,7,2,33,7,41,30,4,15,0,0,0,0,43,5,0,9,5,166,47,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17210986762971558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16464128690079702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13119497966797422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11292907924389108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12307610785847355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922094015304913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014244218162128,0.09416942168040822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526231830476276,0.10144425354316293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09835273980751703,0.09153221934652336,0.0,0.11798779017776945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032284246856916,0.061156713916498476,0.0,0.0860648029685019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0721280908279455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11827826049788848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393722840560888,0.08299474810752215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11948713674640775,0.0,0.1027250328354882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24109357014329574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189755718818493,0.10236086710197394,0.08557505099302308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10642812106199252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10142027428326897,0.0,0.0,0.08649209371784186,0.09405506960121528,0.0,0.24612069786074114,0.4997696935498236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08542958094844211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2191784831627281,0.0,0.0,0.11202483614476418,0.2588809215463055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12694123421723033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31336273617727245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,geothermalantlers,2019/02/12,"Rubber Gloves and Touch Sensitivity TL;DR - any alternatives for rubber gloves in college Biology Lab classes?

Hello! 
So, I’m not diagnosed officially but I’ve been talking with doctors and such recently. I was never really tested as a kid and I’m just now learning I might be autistic. Something I struggle with a lot is touch sensitivity and latex/rubber gloves are are NIGHTMARE. I’m in a Cell Biology class in college and we use them every class. What happens to me is I can’t focus on anything other than wanting the gloves off. This makes the class harder than it would be because I’m already very slow to understand science-type things and it takes me longer than most to do the labs (much to the very obvious chagrin of all of my classmates, TA, and professor, which is also horrible because I’m very paranoid when I’m stared at). 

So, are there any alternatives to rubber gloves in lab settings? I can handle most other kinds of gloves, just as long as they don’t cling and stick to my skin and smell. I really need to pass this class and I’m not sure how much longer I can deal with everyone being angry with me for working so slowly. 

Thank you all!",4.644697968873646,6.306812878923767,5.664895805855978,77.81206805592194,70.43497757847534,8.117013980480085,29.26114481667107,8.671277953709913,2.366252651015563,924,36,166,16,17,305,126,223,0.103,0.88,0.017,-0.9642,0,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,1,1,2,1,11,4,0,1,7,0,18,3,1,3,5,37,33,20,0,3,5,0,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,9,15,0,0,2,0,0,1,5,1,0,0,2,5,16,3,29,26,7,15,0,0,1,0,9,7,0,4,6,111,25,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18414109353786734,0.1334429068471248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.226949590110332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13731673361737634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20344027558384156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720318114972996,0.0,0.16936576552316546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707947121727875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14059204096359565,0.15944788504377044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475593036571876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737655564752896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14767141016447105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14186374727007453,0.0,0.0,0.11138454015722808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17701875742429354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24533183690949836,0.12372923506358804,0.12869756502677718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137976284823352,0.0,0.16476032432858242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284618175984286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744448703553267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15726949767586054,0.0,0.12546267863297694,0.13412079811523858,0.0,0.15362805490704812,0.0,0.0,0.11085854431580844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17371368626454262,0.0,0.14411889292597024,0.0,0.4130464792941073,0.09842205752637652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12148064195548824,0.0,0.0,0.11853702036564324,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,msemmedi,2019/02/12,"Resources for adults working with neurodivergent children/ on the spectrum? Hi guys!

I hope this is the right place for this, otherwise mods feel free to delete. Apologies if this is wrong. 

My mom has recently begun working with kindergarten/first grade kids. She supervises them at lunch time while the actual teachers rotate through their own breaks. She sometimes entertains them with games/story time. Note, she is not a trained educator, but she was hired to help oversee the kids so that the teachers that are with them all day could 'take a breather'.

She absolutely loves it, but she started mentioning that there is there one child in the kindergarten class (5-6 yr old) that does not talk and does not interact with kids around him. According to his educators, he is practically non-verbal (he has muttered a few words before) and when things get loud, he likes to sit alone. He does seem to follow quite attently in games where bright cue cards are used, but he does not otherwise participate in activities (he listens no problem, eats autonomily and when he needs go to the washroom he'll get up and stand by the door - no words).

My mom is at a loss to what to do. She's a 50 yr old Italian woman, and can be quite loud and boisterous around the kids (which they love) but I'm afraid that if she tries to force her hand to get the kid to talk/participate more, she will overwhelm him. (She overwhelms me, and I'm her daughter lol)

Is there any resources that I can pass along to her in regards to neurodivergence/spectrum? Do you have any suggestions on activities that she can propose to the kids for lunch time where he can partecipate and not feel overwhelmed?

Thank you so much ",6.276885744713218,7.499344773162942,5.566627110908264,81.69963791267308,66.12460063897764,9.028997413661953,31.518180435113344,9.23628265651192,2.5810378518180435,1346,52,256,24,21,407,174,313,0.076,0.8390000000000001,0.085,0.7807,0,1,0,1,0,0,44.0,0,2,5,5,11,15,0,4,16,1,22,6,1,1,1,39,42,19,0,6,11,3,3,1,0,2,0,3,1,11,14,16,3,0,4,2,1,3,7,7,0,1,1,7,29,9,36,37,5,33,0,4,1,2,58,15,0,4,13,154,43,6,0.0,0.0,0.11960686450442673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12694154879318076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666983455325329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21821968610832476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10429475095300478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09785908314558872,0.0,0.0,0.07904501552961626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4290337924647981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12541575175632785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12394623813014027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10425468930943013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921072357979144,0.0,0.06965715738206257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12135974055007286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08215349473043704,0.0,0.0,0.12173582450608987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059879621065530665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22124143895417706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28709594503733626,0.0,0.0,0.09010020969720343,0.09088123388581083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25722507548928225,0.0,0.08305398311401732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280555211216126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11727923545486996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.260728336798754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210192689117699,0.0,0.0,0.10467080708137236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157960335701572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122103860607295,0.0,0.08675293910994021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09215447775882536,0.19702802843965375,0.0,0.1128424271131572,0.0,0.0,0.08142749196685567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144078917485497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321435821025022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585778541860333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17845920777706634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13400682464374356,0.0,0.0
autism,zgroh96,2019/02/12,"Help with a child I babysit Hi everyone!  So I currently work with a child on the spectrum.  I have known the family for many year and just recently the child's behavior has gotten a little worse.  But the mother confided in me that some of the behaviors are really having a negative affect on the family.  In particular,  the child is like very afraid of her brother. She avoids him and makes a big deal when he is in the same area as her. I guess this has been going on for years but I have just become aware of it because it has gotten worse. She also like needs constant supervision and her mom doesn't know what to do. She is currently getting ABA therapy maybe twice a week but I'm not sure if that is helping the situation.The brother is about 6 years older than her and honestly wants nothing to do with his sister-he finds her to be annoying and usually locks himself in his room and does his own thing. But she has told me before that she things he like bangs on her door,  growls at her and like messes up her stuff.  The mother has told me that he never does this and I don't think it's true either. Maybe there is something more going on? Could she be having delusions because she truly believes that her brother is doing this stuff to her and gets very upset over it. Or maybe anxiety?  Was just wondering if anyone else has a similar experience with a child they know. I just want to know how I can help!  Thanks!

autism,scubahana,2019/02/12,"Flying off the handle here I might have fractured my ankle. I’m at the hospital now after getting an X-ray and waiting for crutches. This whole thing is stressful but I’m so badly not coping. And some lady has a meaty monitor or something that’s letting off a harsh alarm every *second*. I feel like I’m going to die. 

I just needed to tell someone who would get what I’m feeling.

autism,gnmf,2019/02/13,"I want to find a link between ""super strength"" and ""autism"", I have a video in the post showing my unusual strength, I'm a mild autistic and want to prove my theory that there is a link between them, can you help me? Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to write this in a few words. I'm trying to find evidence of a link between that genes that give us autistic traits, and physical strength, as it happens to me. I'll explain below and have a video below for you to see it's not a joke, it's a serious question/study I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Autism could be a wonderful thing, although I realize it's not always the case. But I found I was Asperger/Autism Level 1, some weeks ago, and everything in my life made more sense than before.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to find out if I was when I found some hidden papers from my childhood telling that between 2 and 6 years old I was a more severe case of autism child, not talking to anyone, agressive, isolating myself, etc. Between 6 and 8 I improved a lot. Since then I had a wonderful life and nowadays I'm just a mild autistic person, and never imagined I was.

&amp;#x200B;

As I now know how to talk to people, recognize sarcasm and use it, almost eliminated my obsessive compulsive disorder, got used to look people's in the eyes (doesn't mean I like it), can make friends, talk to strangers, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just very distracted which now I know it's the reason that my relationships all went bad (once I turned around and noticed that my girlfriend was 40 feet back staring at me saying «you weren't listening to me, you don't love me» etc), so my distraction destroys relationships, and I don't feel the need to be with people, but besides that, my life seems perfect this way. I have 9-11 autistic traits from the known panflets about autism, but always lived a neuro-typical life, + -.

&amp;#x200B;

I even got to have perfect motor skills, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I learned that some of my physical traits came from Autism, like my hyper-sensitivity to light, my hyper-sensitivity to sounds (even listen to my neighbours discussions), pain tolerance (probably my cold tolerance, can stand below 0ºC 30 farenheit just in a tshirt not feeling cold)...

&amp;#x200B;

And I know I have a really unusual strength, I can roll 3 or 4 frying pans together as if they were mazagines, I can bend horseshoes with my hands, bend steel bars, adjustable wrenches, but, having a height of 5'11'' and a bodyweight of 140lbs, body mass index 19 to 20, never had training before!

&amp;#x200B;

Of course then I started doing feats and improved but, my base strength was too high.

&amp;#x200B;

Check an example:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zuabvEjcdQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zuabvEjcdQ)

&amp;#x200B;

I know I look pretty ""neuro-typical"" but I guess nobody will say that to me here, as I've heard also from my friends that ""you don't look autistic"". I have grown to be almost neuro-typical, besides my ADHD, walking on the street with mathematical patterns like fibonacci, loving to be alone, etc. On the video I may look some neuro-typical guy, if that's what you might think, but I still have 9-11 from the 14 basic autistic traits.

&amp;#x200B;

They say my brain compensated, at my time there wasn't a 2e child, I would be autistic or not autistic, just that, my mother insisted for me to go to a public school, no special teaching, and I adapted luckily because of my brain for what they say. I learn everything very quickly, am a self-taught polymath.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go higher on my trainings because when bending unbraced (using only hands or wrists) steel bars that require above 600lbs of force to bend, I start having blood coming out from the pores of my skin, and hear my heartbeat (intra-cranial blood pressure too high and risk of brain hemorrage), etc, so I stopped training because I found my body's limits, but not my strength limit though.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this may come from Autism.

&amp;#x200B;

I even made a video telling that to find others, but it's in a terrible English:

[https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&amp;video\_id=Jy0K4UvVOo4](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&amp;video_id=Jy0K4UvVOo4)

&amp;#x200B;

I think it would be too much of a coincidence, for me to have adapted to Society very well (in my point of view, because people say I'm a little anti-social as I'm very introvert, but not shy), and besides all the cool traits I had, having also this huge physical strength?

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought, it must have come from the Asperger's also!

&amp;#x200B;

And once someone told me like ""it seems you want to be like Da Vinci"" as I specialized in several areas like computer programming, technical analysis on finantial markets, etc, but also painted, created and play music, etc. And I answered ""No, I would never be like him, I've very strong and he wasn't!"".

&amp;#x200B;

After all I was mistaken, Da Vinci was very very strong and was able to bend horseshoes with his hands like me... And he was asperger like me...

&amp;#x200B;

So, there must be a link here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying all aspergers, or autistic persons, are very strong, maybe it's a rare gift, but I believe there is a relation!

&amp;#x200B;

I thought in creating that video, so that I would reach very strong and light some steel benders and oldtime-strongmen, hoping some of them would be aspergers.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that if there were like 1% aspergers in population, or autistic persons, like me, and I would find 10% or 20% or 30% of Aspergers in the middle of the strongest guys I've found, there would be a link!

&amp;#x200B;

But they usually don't like the idea to do asperger tests, some due to religion issues (someone explained that it would lead to discussions), others because they don't see themselves as autistic (like I never did because I was ignorant in that area), so I didn't have much luck convincing them to do the tests.

&amp;#x200B;

So my only option left was to ask autistic persons like me if they knew cases of that. And here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a point in this. Oldtime strongmen in the past, always said this, Dennis Rogers says:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ8Lj1pA0WE&amp;list=PLswCft9xAHt-EfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fH&amp;index=7&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ8Lj1pA0WE&amp;list=PLswCft9xAHt-EfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fH&amp;index=7&amp;t=0s)

&amp;#x200B;

That each one has a governor our heads that limits us. Like a chip in a car, that if we take the chip out, it would be a lot faster but blow up its engine sooner. A measure to protect us.

&amp;#x200B;

Some say some persons have more tolerant governors, letting them use more strenght when their lives are at risk, they call it ""hysterical strength"". But it's a rare phenomenon difficult to study.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see one explanation for this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8golExMhp4&amp;list=PLswCft9xAHt-EfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fH&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8golExMhp4&amp;list=PLswCft9xAHt-EfaTXYP1bCGvdyUws06fH&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s)

&amp;#x200B;

You can see in the middle, they notice he has a lot more muscle acceleration than usual. He has a lot more muscle fibers being activated at once, than the typical human being (I have no clue if he's aspie or not though).

&amp;#x200B;

And this comes from our brains. More muscle fibers activated at once by each motor-neurons we have, or having more motor-neurons? Or activating more than usual, etc, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So, it comes from our minds, as human beings are a lot stronger than we imagine, we are just limited to a certain ammount of strength for our own sake. And some persons can go beyond that, having no limits.

&amp;#x200B;

As I have that, rolling frying pans with my hands the first time I've tried, and adjustable wrenches, with no train for 10 years before, and 140lbs for 5'11'' tall, I have that surely.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I was a more severe case of autism in childhood, nowadays everybody think I'm a typical neuro-typical person, but I'm asperger still.

&amp;#x200B;

There must be a link, I'm certain of that. And I notice certain oldtime-strongmen in the past like Mighty Atom in the US, seemed Asperger to me, introverts, focused on certain hobbies, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

On the asperger section nobody had clear answers, maybe here some of you have.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know examples of stronger than usual persons, being autistic? Specially Level 1 Autism/Asperger to be sure it happens also in aspergers like me, that's it's a trai possible in mild autism also.

&amp;#x200B;

If so, tell me your opinion on this, or where should I find examples. I want to test my theory and find answers, and know what gave me this strength, Autism, or I was simply gifted with strength also.

&amp;#x200B;

By the way this is a serious question I'm really interested to find out, I'm not claiming to be ""super man"" or something!

&amp;#x200B;

Or, it would be very important if you know, do you know some specialist that may study these things and give me answers? Someone that studies autistic traits, etc?

autism,lostsanitymom,2019/02/13,"HELP! My high school son won't do homework! My son is 16 and a sophomore in high school. We just found out in October that he has Aspergers. He has always struggled with homework but ever since entering high school last year it has been a never ending battle. This year is extremely bad. He failed Spanish last semester. This semester he is failing 3 classes and close to failing another all because he refuses to the homework. He refuses to read for his English class and I have to read out loud to him every night to get it done (he doesn't like audio books). 

How can I get him to do his homework and care about graduating and his future?

autism,OptimusPhillip,2019/02/13,"Humanities Courses in College I'm a first-year mechanical engineering student, diagnosed with Asperger's earlier than I can remember. The university I attend has a mandatory number of humanities credits in order to graduate, which I've decided to cover with an honors sequence, and despite the fact that I got good grades in last semester's course, I always feel like I struggle with it, even into the second semester. It causes me a lot of stress, to the point where I've had minor meltdowns over certain major assignments. I don't have anywhere near this level of difficulty with my science and math courses, so I'm starting to wonder if it's just an autism thing. Did anyone else have similar difficulties?

autism,1of3s,2019/02/13,"Potty accidents Okay so my 11 year old autistic son started having poo accidents last year.

We are making him help clean them out and put them in the washer. 

I am at my wits end. This is now happening daily, and he has decided to hide the undies so he doesn’t have to clean them. 

Does anyone have advice that can help? Please.

autism,sailormoon90,2019/02/13,"ABA thoughts So I’ve never worked in ABA and didn’t know much about it until this week. I was hired as a BT. I got a week of training and then thrown into working with kids. It’s crazy to me that kids with intricate plans and interests get a new therapist with a week of knowledge on ABA.  Some of the things I observed were somewhat disturbing...using food to get kids to do things or to “reinforce” good behavior, getting in a child’s face and make them look so they say the correct sound, and seeing children cry because they wouldn’t comply giving a high five. the worst to me is that therapists and technicians alike treat people with autism like a science experiment or animal and use all these ridiculous terms to describe things. 

My sister is high functioning and has struggled her whole life with some of these things like saying the correct things. I’ve just loved her anyway and said f the people who think you’re “weird.” I hate the attitude that people with autism aren’t people. We are all human and communicate and see the world differently. I know that some good things come out of ABA but damn I was very disappointed in what I saw. Thank God my sister wasn’t subjected to that. I just needed to share my experience ",5.603262711864411,6.7341822500000035,5.462500000000002,82.17052966101697,67.60169491525424,8.78135593220339,27.885593220338983,9.017664075816787,2.083827118644068,985,31,188,17,16,306,138,236,0.092,0.8029999999999999,0.106,0.0799,2,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,1,0,3,3,6,16,3,1,14,0,12,4,1,2,5,44,33,19,0,2,5,2,0,2,0,1,1,4,0,6,18,21,1,0,5,0,0,1,5,7,0,1,9,8,19,9,28,23,10,18,0,1,4,1,21,9,1,6,10,122,37,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06894506118456385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09742613135537244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12423567161153795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11816602937508185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22126813066529175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13676166507548435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1772711482459528,0.10849637804667443,0.0,0.18972679375182552,0.09045686232076564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116634032183234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389939357571387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12431423713725127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988628139764974,0.11051045671164046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497599847934947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10207768530970557,0.0,0.0754955125194939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314193665784755,0.08386264378867077,0.08723013640844958,0.1092332407844596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.313638793996726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758454726104648,0.17988423464122485,0.0,0.0,0.18025303130252274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11823727848839558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041278145621352,0.0,0.2626369712254658,0.4508339815457168,0.07247028210687738,0.0,0.08978922364816337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360460668593959,0.09768258386513733,0.0,0.09331981980223247,0.0,0.0,0.27216737911270883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262727537136025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646771322605594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I run an autism Instagram account, and I'm in the beginning stages of working on a project that will last throughout the month of April. This is where I need your help. I will post the link to the original post about this project here, but I will also post a brief summary of it here. I'll accept PMs on here if you do not have an Instagram account, but still would like to participate. I can also answer any questions you might have about it. Thanks in advance! :)

autism,SherlockIsTheName,2019/02/13,"Looking for Input I am working on a paper about bettering accommodations for special needs children in after school programs and summer camps. This is based on my own experience where the only real accommodations for these kids are not being allowed to be “kicked out” of program and allowing them in the first place. In my mind, it’s not a real accommodation if we aren’t helping them succeed and thrive. 
My idea is implementing a system called The Buddy system. If the parents and the program saw fit, the child would be matched with their own person who would be there to play games with them, assist them with activities, and help them calm down when feeling overstimulated or overwhelmed. Essentially, they would be guaranteed the attention they need that they may not get from the regular program leaders who are already dealing with 15+ kids.
This isn’t just a paper for me, it is something I actually want to bring to my boss as an idea. Recently I found out that an autistic boy at my last school had been pulled out of program because he was struggling. I feel like if he’d had a Buddy to aid him when he was feeling overwhelmed or anxious he could’ve enjoyed the program more. He deserves the same experience of being in program just like any neurotypical kid and he deserves more accommodations than just letting him be in program. I am looking for input from all sorts of people before I present this to my boss. 

*Questions for Parents*
How would you feel about your child having their own helper?
Would you be more inclined to send your child to program if they had a helper assigned to them?
If your child did have a helper, what amount of communication would you like with that person? (I.e. meetings, texts, phone calls to discuss your child’s needs?)
What ways would a Buddy help your child most? 
What are the pros?
What are the cons?
If your child is in a program now, how do you feel about the level of help and attention they are currently getting?

*Questions for Folks on the Spectrum*
In large groups of peers, what overwhelmed you most as a child?
How did large group activities make you feel?
How did arts and crafts time make you feel?
Do you feel like adults cares when you felt overwhelmed?
Do you feel like adults helped your relationships with NT children?
If you were given a Buddy, how would you have felt?
What do you think the pros of having a Buddy would be?
What would the cons of having a Buddy be?

autism,TheWhiteRose000,2019/02/14,"Autistic - FL - Needing Advice Hey Anon,  


A few years ago I was diagnosed with Autism in Florida before moving to Europe to be with my now ex-wife. Fast Forward, I ended up in Pennsylvania and the notes of my autism were added as well as depression because I was suicidal when visiting a therapist, however I learned that I need a copy of my diagnosis for state help in Florida again.  


The place that had my initial diagnosis has long since closed and I can't find a copy of it, and I am not sure where to go to get a copy. I am afraid since if I have to get re-diagnosed I may say or do something that would make them think I am no longer Autistic and I desperately need medical coverage.  


You ever take a test and you remember the answers, but you have to re-take a test and the answers change? That, I'm afraid of that.

autism,Monkey-Magic007,2019/02/14,"Ocean Heaven - Netflix Hi All, my son is 9 years old and is autistic.  I love him!  

My wife and I try to give our best everyday. We're continuously working on his development (interactions with people, motor skill coordination), revise his school work and his nutrition.  At times its overwhelming, but usually put that on the side and keep going.  I love watching him pause and stare off in the distance, and the smile he shows when he is in his wonderland.  

I stumbled upon this movie on Netflix yesterday ""Ocean Heaven"".  It's about a father who had a terminal illness with an autistic son - and man did it get me.  I was overwhelmed.  My heart feels like crying. 

I just wanted to pause and take a moment to tell all the parents out there, keep up the great work!  We have amazing little creations that we need to nurture.  We want them to get the fullest out of this life and I wouldn't have it any other way!

autism,the-real-putin,2019/02/14,"Getting someone diagnosed History of autism in our family, one of my siblings is currently ruining her life. Everyone is distancing themselves from her, her partner has left her after the way she treated his family and most people can’t stand to be around her. Uncompromising, lacking empathy, unable to change plans or self reflect, quick to take offence and always being brutally honest with people without any understanding of how she is wrong or responsible. Think the final straw was how she treated her partners gran, very rude and wouldn’t be surprised is she mad the old lady cry.


So she is staying with our mum who is also giving serious thought to putting her out, she had a baby under nine months.

She really needs to talk to someone but seems completely unwilling to comprehend that she is doing this and it’s not everyone else that is the problem here, I’m pretty thick skinned and I jumped out of her car at a set of traffic lights and walked home the other week rather that put up with her. 

How do you convince someone this single minded and stubborn to get checked out? We have a history of spectrum diagnosis in the close family and this seems like it might be a thing with her. Also in the U.K.

autism,graye1999,2019/02/14,"ASD diagnosis My psychologist has diagnosed me as being on the spectrum. 

One question I have. As an infant, I spoke meaningful words extremely early. At age 5 months, I was calling my mother when she was in the other room by using “mama” and it was obvious that I knew what I was saying. I continued to develop my speech at a much higher level than the norm. 

Is this typical for individuals with ASD? Is it something that would disprove the diagnosis? I have many other symptoms (?) that say that I do have it.

autism,Senoverload,2019/02/14,"Anyone able to record audio for a sensory overload film? Hi guys,

I thought I’d post here to ask for some help/ contributors.

I’m trying to create a short film conveying the visual and auditory experiences of sensory overload from various people.

I  am hoping to record real people’s spoken experiences to overlay on top  footage that can hopefully be edited to replicate their feelings.

I found some great detailed examples on this site: [https://themighty.com/2016/02/people-explain-what-sensory-overload-feels-like/](https://themighty.com/2016/02/people-explain-what-sensory-overload-feels-like/)

e.g.   “Imagine walking into a room filled with 25 72-inch flat-screen TVs  that all have super-high definition and surround sound, but they’re all  playing different movies. On full blast. At the same time”

(So I would film this scene like described above with the voice over.)

Would  anyone who experiences sensory overload be willing to record a short  audio clip explaining what being overloaded feels like? I’ve tried  interviewing a few children in person, but they were too young to really  understand what I was asking them, so I’m getting desperate now haha

Would anyone be willing to upload (or message privately!) a sound file for the film?

Hope to hear from you!",10.359506802721086,13.46406437244898,7.868244897959182,61.92437414965988,58.33673469387754,9.716462585034016,33.98503401360544,10.047579312681364,3.925818095238096,1051,41,136,22,15,305,132,196,0.05,0.815,0.135,0.9416,1,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,0,1,3,1,5,8,0,0,10,1,14,0,0,0,2,27,29,7,0,6,3,0,2,2,0,5,0,6,1,3,7,5,0,0,7,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,8,9,8,25,16,8,20,0,0,0,0,16,14,0,6,5,83,16,2,0.13946365666168709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2925486942881522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2607593855377854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14570983788525912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4092666515781157,0.0,0.0,0.1410340304443332,0.09963286418526547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15291470107200458,0.0,0.0,0.0728640044555773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537591738194691,0.0,0.13809094653993575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1571856769675505,0.0,0.09347954929261644,0.147351010349156,0.0,0.4155566374236626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044046941904947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19337307883439864,0.12177428563297794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13356763176647038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15874017376110355,0.08934398962850253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11071856514776034,0.0813223797364475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18937333647686067,0.0,0.0,0.1451865850348343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29721294085401856,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,HighZenDurp,2019/02/14,"Did we as parents do the right thing? I apologize for the lengthy post but I need help and this is the only community that can possibly relate...

I have a son who is on the spectrum. One of his struggles is controlling his anger. He hasn't figured out how to process this emotion in an appropriate way. He can easily become upset about anything from losing on a video game, to being told he has to do his homework. When he doesn't get as he wants, the majority of the time he gets upset, and when he gets upset he can have a meltdown, or he will harm himself by hitting himself. He will also say he wants to die &amp; that he wants to kill himself.

We have taken him to anger management counselors. We have seen neurologists as recommended by the counselor for tests and medication recommendations. 4 days out of the week, for about 3 hours, he goes to a special group that helps with children on the spectrum.  So far these attempts to help him have done very little to nothing to help him from getting so angry.

Today he attended his special group as usual. Apparently he got upset about something and threatened to kill himself. This resulted in them advising to his mom(we are not together) to take to immediately see a counselor for evaluation.... The counselor evaluated him and advised his mom that we admit him to a suicide prevention &amp; anger management type specialist at a local hospital. 

These specialists help with children a can't properly manage their anger or have threatened suicide. They will take the child for 3-7 days. During this time the child will attend group meetings that teaches the children to manage their their anger and find alternate ways to cope with angry thoughts. Doctors will also monitor the child and determine the proper medication they think will help the child. They will then monitor the child for several days to see how they react to the medication. 

His mom said she wanted to admit him. I wanted to explore other options to get him help. We ended up making the decision to admit him to this hospital program and it was one of the hardest things I've had to do as a parent. He was so scared. He begged us to not make him stay at the hospital. Of course he had a huge meltdown and the nurses had to physically carry him to his room.

Now I'm just sitting here feeling helpless. I'm torn up because I know he's scared and I can't be there to help him. He has to sleep there overnight and I know he's just terrified... I'm sure he feels betrayed. The 2 people that are supposed to help him and protect him didn't save him from this fear he is feeling, and honestly I can't help but feel like I betrayed him myself.

Did we do the right thing? Or did we jump to an extreme conclusion before exploring other options?

Thank you.",4.853574144486688,6.552923853612171,5.5559904942965845,78.65048764258556,69.96958174904944,8.37787072243346,31.21083650190114,8.912814788092511,2.718832091254753,2201,95,395,41,40,714,232,526,0.211,0.6679999999999999,0.121,-0.9976,3,0,1,0,0,2,56.0,8,1,8,4,18,25,7,8,36,0,45,5,1,7,1,69,83,33,5,6,9,5,4,1,0,7,4,2,2,8,21,25,0,3,17,2,0,5,8,18,0,2,16,9,55,7,70,57,1,42,0,2,3,0,106,18,0,5,15,265,76,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189919084029753,0.0,0.1651591622069278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06271895266777723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04646032817317137,0.08417415279020106,0.06485387018104732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08548228685368138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14745828899653488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909976981862503,0.0,0.0,0.07800990590498702,0.0,0.0779950300627538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08573230240168682,0.06750440806872336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857637499430234,0.15414760884262327,0.05444844669018538,0.0,0.0,0.06965968636531952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19909755152957107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06095658538452479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.510857165243906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07505702294004198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16864255936724207,0.0,0.08377221159515429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03723509702635087,0.07638806332684214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526577188708462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017490223953202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23033762499454494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677884022755808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05651290875587413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07313093290832784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329133901134634,0.05796540546868144,0.0,0.0,0.16925682978907014,0.0,0.0,0.0528383072208661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859216481603868,0.07299348600726564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13017542823913705,0.07249849787977826,0.060609711783693565,0.15261024215765698,0.0,0.12146794628415145,0.0,0.0,0.08610194487926671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762706515504148,0.0,0.0,0.0586744997883705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812356989693782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07967710328326492,0.0,0.16673501310455424,0.0,0.07183231002495401,0.0,0.11460930646195452,0.0,0.0,0.07016909338235637,0.0,0.0,0.1519027931395982,0.04883588514737108,0.0,0.06050668061546285,0.08888386967507864,0.0,0.07224348619484831,0.07282728107196948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09167799410658732,0.0,0.08394072625767343,0.06288585982201801,0.22476970595086027,0.12099280663027748,0.06113556472526317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,unbridged77,2019/02/14,"Preschool Questions for Parents/Guardians Hi, everyone. My name is Christine and have a 2.5+ year old son with autism who is also non-verbal. 

He’s currently in an extremely play based ABA program in home, but when he turns 3 at the end on July, the regional center wants to transition him to a public preschool. 

Has anyone else done this, and if no, what age did your child start school?

Has anyone continued ABA through insurance? 

Did anyone go private or to an autism specific preschool/school? 

Any insight would be amazing because I feel conflicted and overwhelmed. Thank you :)",6.129134615384616,8.212969798076928,5.251153846153848,80.56884615384617,67.36538461538461,8.661538461538461,35.115384615384606,9.188382445141503,3.388984615384615,465,23,78,9,8,139,85,104,0.026,0.826,0.14800000000000002,0.9237,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,2,0,0,2,4,0,1,6,0,10,0,0,0,0,14,16,8,0,3,3,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,3,4,0,1,3,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,5,3,10,11,0,14,0,1,0,0,12,5,0,3,8,43,8,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16971518655419512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14431936823775435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4451751586561789,0.21744822208266654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12936957512062944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2171784896380861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17728563841500866,0.0,0.1879671740171485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2027888045550202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10730666057448728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12061159832753318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21287763755773434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2226930343605422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23773907212523945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4295633538894768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15021300091633494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19538703565846052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23083840368630495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251750149093565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15075760113634715,0.0,0.0,0.13666508088742452

autism,Maxstressed,2019/02/14,"I need someone to talk to. Help me please. Hello, Dad of newly diagnosed autistic son. I need someone to talk to that isn't my wife. She has enough on her plate without having to deal with trying to help me. I'll be clear that we're a good family, normal relationship etc but I don't want to be a burden to her or my son. They need a rock, and I'm trying to be that for them, but I feel like a hollow one that's starting to crack leading to an eventual collapse.

Has anyone here been through anything dark with this that ""got better"" or ""learned to process"" that isn't judgemental that could message me?

I'm starting to see that there's tons of no no's and terms not to use, or things that offend people, and I assure, and promise I'm not trying to offend anyone if any verbage I've used isn't considered correct whether it be politically or factual. I find this diagnosis to almost be like a exclusive club that's very difficult to navigate without unintentionally sounding ignorant or politically incorrect. I'm so very very new to all of this, and I'm going through something that I feel like is similar to ""grieving"" like I've lost my son.. :( 
I feel guilty and horrible for saying that and to be honest makes me feel so incredibly inadequate as a pathetic ""father"" that it sickens me knowing that I'm me.

This isn't fair, and I feel like my son has been taken from me and most precious memories that I dreamed of forging with my son will now be forever a dream. I've sacrificed my entire life. where I've lived, the work I've done, any money or security I've had to build the best life I could to give him the best. 

I'm exhausted. I'm depressed. I'm disappointed.
I'm so sad that I haven't shared a single word with my son. I want the very best for him, but I'm no longer here. I feel so utterly hollow and misunderstood and sad.

Anyone have good wisdom to share?
More importantly, am I a monster for having these emotions? Am I in the minority or majority for feeling like this? 

I've kept this in as long as I possibly could trying to deal with this on my own and simply can't anymore.

autism,overwhelming-guilt,2019/02/15,"How should I tell a child with autism to give me some personal space? Heyo, I am a high school dude and I kind of have a thing about personal space. There's a kid with autism in our PE class, and he's pretty cool. I talk to him and try to make him feel included and stuff, partnering with him during weightlifting sessions and things. Just the one thing is he has a habit of getting a bit too physically close, and it makes me uncomfortable. Please understand that this has nothing to do with his autism, if it was literally anybody I would be uncomfortable. I've told him a few times to please give me some space, but he doesn't seem to understand. How should I go about this situation?

autism,AlbanyCat123,2019/02/15,"Help with finding job utilizing memory for dates and locations Hello /r/autism!

I have two cousins (twin boys) with autism who recently turned 18 and are beginning to start employment. One of whom is verbal and has an amazing memory for dates and locations. For example, if I were to ask what day my birthday was on three years ago, he would respond with the correct day of the week in about three seconds. He is also very strong with directions, basically being able to navigate to anywhere he has been before.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering what kind of job opportunities there may for someone with autism where he might be able to utilize this.

I appreciate any thoughts or suggestions of where else to look around for this kind of information as well.

autism,pbbft,2019/02/15,"Parent in need of help on how to deal with temper tantrums. (not meltdowns) Hi,

So my son, 8, was recently diagnosed with Autism. They say he's on the far side of the scale but on the spectrum. Reading through some of the posts on here I see a lot of stuff we've been dealing with like him not being able to wipe his bum and such.  Can anyone point me in a direction on how to deal with temper tantrums? I'm not talking about meltdowns though because I know they differ. This would be situations where he wants something and acts out (and quite inappropriately). We're at a loss what to do because every common avenue of resolution seems to make things worse.

Thanks a bunch in adv.

autism,PrestigiousMonkey,2019/02/15,"PDDNOS troubles Hi, I'm a M/16/USA

I had recently been talking to a girl in my grade, (16) for just over a week. She had recently just left a relationship with someone who was absolutely horrible to her (4-5 weeks ago, 11 months together). I had always kinda seen her as someone with potential, we weren't great friends but we certainly were close. I managed to get her friend to convince her that I was someone of interest, and the girl eventually started talking to me. Things were just normal for around 2 days when she straight up told me she had feelings for me. Things progressed and she was pretty excited on having a genuine relationship with me. We had good conversation IRL, on social media, and we would regularly call for 3-6 hours playing games together, or just talking about life.vShe was quite ill and had missed a couple of days off school, and I decided i wouldn't come today as I had a stomach bug. She ended up coming to surprise me, which she was upset when I didn't end up coming.

Then she got all weird,

I started talking normally and asked her about plans we had made for the weekend, which now she couldn't do, she continually left me on read. The conversation as follows

\-M if you don't wanna talk to me, let me know, because i'm getting a weird vibe and you seem off me. -F It's not that I don't want to talk it's just that I think we should put this on pause for a little while while i get my shit together as it is still soon. -m what changed? you came to surprise me this morning but now you want this to go on hold? you were happy yesterday -f Nothing has changed, i just don't know how to put it but you didn't do anything i promise, i think we should just wait. -m what do you mean by wait? do you not wanna tune me, do you not wanna date so soon? i have feelings for you and i understand if you need time, but i just don't wanna lose this already, i don't wanna be hurt. -just maybe stop tuning for a while, i'm sorry - we can still like talk and be friends and I know and i understand if you strongly dislike me but i just want time.

This just kinda hit me hard for some reason, i felt like i got led on almost. I haven't been in the game since june last year after i ended a year long relationship. Was just hoping for some real advice.",2.4447138228941654,4.222703295896331,3.7570793736501074,88.74253050755941,76.51619870410367,6.703434125269978,24.74994600431965,7.554174236665415,1.1024782289416843,1778,61,378,24,40,582,210,463,0.08900000000000001,0.7759999999999999,0.135,0.9746,0,0,0,0,1,0,60.0,8,12,0,5,25,26,1,1,15,0,46,3,2,4,2,98,87,32,0,20,24,0,4,2,3,4,1,0,0,2,19,28,0,4,14,5,0,9,14,8,0,0,29,5,75,18,54,49,3,69,0,3,1,0,59,20,1,11,42,261,94,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607666531363827,0.06901163764623193,0.0,0.07795813888013252,0.0,0.08591228638063861,0.0,0.06477960463212153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06406606106617853,0.06930532483473828,0.07278167705362308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0474582258677659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07949621492114317,0.08904264081529921,0.0,0.0,0.1647154680077534,0.2011893789567522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614242749000246,0.0,0.1004169802558982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20686290246946176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07872923335971654,0.0,0.0747507104457333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18044619025858807,0.0,0.1220243197808377,0.0,0.044245429965763014,0.06529907201719261,0.12453168158967255,0.08583277269104382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08287554649175341,0.06974064294817739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07732520389779259,0.07666913445754622,0.0,0.08334282464886551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12835726830770244,0.06346026454090861,0.0,0.0,0.16917416789747602,0.0796095640620518,0.054989597821321456,0.07606970137181084,0.07802876358199906,0.0,0.06889710621640156,0.0,0.08709715191687697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07366601796462352,0.0,0.0,0.07821340658444004,0.0848043109429278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0621412071581323,0.0,0.0,0.057726720702103176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15255804793724315,0.07470167492032484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920408857196046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15652674363976182,0.0,0.08280582928933722,0.07787367377787346,0.0886133094560656,0.0,0.08004544505147643,0.1537401119535896,0.25075368917629204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07879099337843855,0.0,0.07087408834187874,0.0,0.0,0.07991458103765545,0.0644004799889017,0.0,0.0,0.07936092735953608,0.19789278065020527,0.0,0.0,0.08714961825836008,0.11020895012007467,0.0,0.12434638304785953,0.06508826442185835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4380248285228441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10344362384316874,0.099769612437415,0.0,0.0,0.09079296098207074,0.0,0.07379516719147418,0.07439150110103229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16209461642549378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13775845190099675,0.0,0.12489732868311396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055304257429461316,0.0,0.0,0.100269051219256
autism,logictoinsanity,2019/02/16,"Should I try and get a diagnosis?  So I've been wondering if I might be autistic in some form and I've been doing alot of research but I can't really tell if it's worth asking my doctor about, especially because doing so would be really stressful, and I'm nervous to mention it to my dad so I don't wanna do it unless it's a likely thing. I also have a habit of being afraid that I'm making things up for attention without realizing it even though I've been diagnosed with stuff in the past. I took a quiz on [aqtest.net](https://aqtest.net/) (obviously not the most reliable thing in the world but it seemed to line up with alot of what I read online) and it gave me a 38, with 32-50 being a high likelyhood, and recommending I talk to a doctor.

I have alot of the symptoms, I get exhausted by being around people, I shut down when I get overwhelmed, I don't understand why people can't just say what they mean, I get sensory overload, I have issues with certain textures, I hate large groups, I have a hard time making friends, I fidget alot, I don't know how to react in emotional situations (when someone cried in front of me I tend to panic and either run away or really have to fight the urge to) and things like that, but I'm pretty good at understanding sarcasm (my family is very sarcastic so I've been around it my whole life) and I'm pretty good at public speaking, and I'm not /too/ bad about routines usually.

Sometimes though, if it's something I've been thinking about alot and it changes slightly, I freak out. Like one time I was freaking out about a year-long group project (I don't do well in groups because I'm a control freak and want to do it all myself) and I had it in my head that we were going to be assigned our groups, and I had talked to my teacher about wanting to be in a pair with this one girl, and that's what I had prepared for. But then my teacher told us to get into groups of 4-5, and I freaked out and had a panic attack. It ended up being fine, it was me my friend and this other girl who I ended up really liking, but I had to leave the class and stuff it was bad.

I also have the special interest type stuff, and I'm really good at recognizing patterns and noticing details and math and stuff like that, I've also always been obsessed with logic (hence the username). I learned to read when I was 2, which is something I noticed mentioned a few times. I'm also a biologically female, but I'm trans.

anyway, I'm sorry for rambling and I'm sure there's plenty I forgot but I'd really like your guys' opinions. Should I talk to my doctor?

autism,jon_queer,2019/02/16,"Diagnostic standard/screening for adults? I participated in a screening for one of my 14 month old twins (and will do the other in the next few days), and learned that she has some indications that she should undergo a diagnostic exam when she’s 18 months (few hours of observed play at home and in a professional’s office.) We expect her sister will have some of the same flags. 

Autism seems to be something that runs in my family. I have two younger cousins who had Aspergers diagnoses when they were little, and an older cousin and uncle who I’ve always thought might be on the spectrum. But there wasn’t the kind of screening when they were kids as there is today.

I feel like I have a lot of resources (so far) for exploring what this might mean for my kids. I have none, though, for addressing questions I have about myself.

I know the rules for this group forbid asking for a diagnosis, so I won’t go into the details of why I think it might be something that applies to me, except to say that a lot of the indications for diagnosis of children seem to apply to what I was like as a child. And some adult characteristics resonate for me, though not all. Knowing that my kid was flagged, though, makes it more real— it’s something I’ve wondered about myself for years. I’m 41, and there wasn’t much awareness of this when I was little.

I’m having trouble finding out anything reliable about how an adult can be evaluated. Is there a standardized diagnostic test yet? If I have to rely on the educated guesswork of an experienced professional, how do I find that person?

Are there adults who identify as being on the spectrum because they know that it’s true for them, without a formal diagnosis? 

(I don’t have the certainty to claim it for myself. But knowing but could be a reality for my kids makes me feel more urgent about figuring out if it’s my truth.)",7.0474369747899175,6.950438526610648,7.270099439775912,74.73237605042019,64.29411764705883,10.165210084033617,33.81638655462185,9.766711354998122,3.097419159663866,1482,57,278,27,20,481,175,357,0.01,0.952,0.037000000000000005,0.7802,0,0,3,0,0,0,39.0,1,0,4,0,21,8,0,0,24,0,38,1,0,4,3,58,56,26,0,5,8,3,2,2,0,7,1,1,2,11,23,11,0,1,18,1,0,3,7,2,0,2,9,6,35,6,50,33,13,31,0,0,2,0,30,14,0,14,16,215,58,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743506421226092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09636182266408036,0.0,0.1094709888624332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07138196213276758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09349336636145844,0.0,0.0,0.07551863719142886,0.0,0.0,0.11885218525649716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103897402679744,0.0,0.11841671389242055,0.083654961397177,0.0,0.0,0.2140512256295707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665495927969208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174590196256747,0.0,0.1153181171974194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219397323042516,0.2574163838694777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11441650932976935,0.23472627328279566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1991053660654651,0.0,0.0,0.1563278855155166,0.0,0.0,0.12755424379517555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726679843404846,0.0,0.0,0.1869332961837108,0.0,0.08608063394516483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453524021196168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287483924356253,0.0,0.07934875559282444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224561189822863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13117675796723735,0.0,0.0,0.13328336203878954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09312117071785736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21320356577638624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27044369379666283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07503178391931438,0.34514509453613323,0.09296287293481703,0.0,0.0,0.11099538033133463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11438790437842755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566289172959477,0.0,0.0,0.1128784644434994,0.12698797841559606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07540738708990427

autism,Oh--possum,2019/02/16,"I was recently diagnosed with autism and it's all I can think about Im constantly thinking ""have I seemed autistic my whole life and the few friends I have only like me out of pity or are lying"" ( I can't tell my friends or they'll leave me ) and it scares me. I'm in high school so everyone is really judging and I feel like one-day somebody will find out and it doesn't help that I now have at least one doctor's appointment once a week so I have to leave during class and people keep asking why and I have to lie about it and I feel like shit. These thoughts are also distracting me in class because my school just had practise exams and I failed all of them even tho I've have good grades all year before I was diagnosed. I don't know what to do because when my doctor asked how I felt about being autistic I said I was fine but a few weeks later Im obviously not.

autism,zetikla,2019/02/16,"Struggling with emotional unstability on top of my aspergers, could need some advice Ever since like 6 years now i cant help but feel like im on an emotional ""rollercoaster"":  i tend to not show off my frustration but instead it just bursts out randomly, sometimes I feel very optimistic and hopeful but many times it feels like that my life isnt going anywhere.

I had 2 diagnose of my condition, one as a child and one roughly when I was around 20-ish, they didnt ""diagnosed"" anything else beside asperger,  although part of me cant help but wonder if i dont show the signs of bipolar syndrome as well.

Its not a topic i feel comfortable bringing up with my family, let alone with my mom because i have a feeling she would just brush it off as me being overly dramatic/ etc and yeah

autism,HisHuntress,2019/02/16,"Ok fellow autism parents, I need advice This is going to be a long one so bare with me. 

I have an 11 year old autistic son (kiddo). He is almost to level 2, but diagnosed officially with level 1. He is in ABA-inhome therapy which is helping immensely. The therapist and I have worked out a weekend schedule that works. She says I have come so far in learning how to handle kiddo. My husband (DH) on the other hand, trying to train him is like banging our heads against a brick wall. So I was the one primarily taking care of kiddo.

Due to the government shutdown back in December I have had to get a job. I am working the 3pm-11pm or 9pm-6am shift at the gas station a block from my house. During the week DH has been pretty good about sticking to the schedule for kiddo. The only fighting is over homework or eating dinner. 

The weekends are a complete disaster. DH tries to make deals with him about chores and reading. When I point out the schedule (which is printed and posted on the fridge) kiddo throws a fit saying that DH said he didn't have to do xyz chore. DH yells at kiddo for not listening, doing what he wants, shutting down, and throwing a temper tantrum which in turn makes kiddo shutdown even more and DH starts yelling louder. It is a complete nightmare. 

This is an every single day thing. DH tries to cut corners and kiddo plays one parent against another to get his way. So when this happens DH and I start arguing and kiddo is off doing his own thing. 

Ok, so here's an example. 

Kiddo's schedule for Saturday: by 10am he has to make his bed and start his laundry. 11:40am he eats lunch and puts his laundry in the dryer. At 1pm he folds and puts away his laundry. At 3:30pm he takes his medicine and eats a snack. At 4pm he gets the mail then reads for 30 mins. THEN he can have his tablet. 

So apparently yesterday while I was at work, DH tells kiddo that he has to read only once this weekend and that he can have his tablet after he eats breakfast. 

So I didn't know that and DH didn't follow the schedule. When I woke up at 8am this morning kiddo immediately asks for his tablet. I asked him if he had made his bed or started his laundry. Kiddo blatantly lies to me (the laundry room is right next to the living room where I am sitting and I can see the washer door is still open) then tells me that DH said he didn't have to do any of that this weekend. I tell kiddo he has to follow his schedule, no matter what anyone else says. Kiddo starts having a meltdown and asks for a break (one of the best things the therapist and I have gotten him to do). While kiddo is sitting on the couch taking a 3 minute break I am sitting here dumbfounded wondering why the hell DH would say that. 

During kiddo's break DH comes downstairs to go to the insurance company and kiddo starts throwing a temper tantrum. I turned to him and said that kiddo has to follow his schedule no matter if it is a long weekend or not. So now I'm the bad guy because I am making kiddo stick to the schedule. DH leaves to go to the insurance company and ***OMG*** kiddo starts following his schedule. I would say I am shocked, but I'm really not. Kiddo knows that momma won't put up with his bullshit. There is a schedule and rules for a reason. Kiddo knows that his life is much smoother when I am the one mainly taking care of him. 

So here's my dilemma:

1) should I continue working. We could use the money to catch up but we don't NEED the money. During the hours I work I know that DH will continue to cut corners and make life hell for kiddo. 

Or

2) quit the job that I actually like and go back to being a stay at home mom. 

I have no idea what to do.

autism,TimIsColdInMaine,2019/02/17,"Does anyone here have strong similarities to their parents? My 7 year old son was diagnosed a while back.  He's very functional, very intelligent, but it's noticeable in the behaviors and socially.  The part that is very interesting to me is how similar he is to me.  Most of my friends/peers that have autistic children have trouble understanding their feelings or relating to them.  For me, it feels like my son is a clone of me, with everything just exaggerated by 30-50 percent.  I got tested (and diagnosed with severe) for ADHD, solely because he was diagnosed with that as well, and his indicating behaviors looked identical to what I remember doing/thinking at his age.   Curious how many others have had similar situations.

autism,Ibidyefaire,2019/02/17,"Do you ever find it easy for people to vilify you or go angry mob on you? I've had many people turn others against me by utilizing half truths, gossip, slander or just not actually knowing what has happened. It's really exhausting more than anything. I realize that a lot of these people are incredibly gullible and that I don't want to associate with them regardless, but still. It just can't be me who experiences this mob mentality. It happened since I was a kid in elementary school. Mainly consisting of mob bullying, mocking my physical disability or turning others against me. Because a lot of people who know me don't understand autism or even know I am autistic I get branded ""bpd"" or ""psycho.""

Which is silly to me because I feel these situations would not be so hurtful and troubling while much easier to get through if I was a psychopath.",6.7706962025316475,7.669485436708863,7.674531645569626,68.18154430379748,64.8860759493671,11.130126582278482,37.31898734177216,11.00357731598739,4.546000506329115,681,34,113,19,10,229,106,158,0.171,0.7759999999999999,0.052000000000000005,-0.9674,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,3,1,0,6,7,1,0,4,0,14,1,0,0,2,28,27,11,0,4,11,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,15,3,0,0,7,0,0,1,5,5,0,1,3,1,17,2,16,21,5,6,0,1,0,0,11,2,0,8,3,90,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.1537867724142317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12968454655269648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921328828222836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19848123725125427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408783568936032,0.142550720590381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541549281812026,0.0,0.0,0.07968310177638084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440359644897379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16467032430616382,0.0,0.08956299835902068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27871565074851873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1687051809201187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598248411125568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26795766622660017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15977325513194687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15881537392598086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11584803682121066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4370169858445714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10095728238420963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15949122013548514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303614879102617,0.17713968064847094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12585294017351906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3428290455850114,0.0,0.16405852396684048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09295167140122236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11194862658662114,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Deranged90,2019/02/17,"Struggling to grow up Is this a common problem for those on the spectrum?

I turn 29 in May yet I find myself unemployed and still living at home with my mother. 

I have never held down a job for longer than 8 months; I don’t have a degree; I have no friends and I can’t afford to live independently.

To make matters worse, I have ADHD (the combined presentation), thus it’s extremely difficult to motivate myself even when I’m not depressed.

Naturally, I’m concerned that my circumstances won’t change and I’ll find myself living at my mother’s home when I’m 35, 40, 45 and so on...

I know I have to take responsibility for my actions (or lack of) but it’s difficult not to feel crippled and helpless by ADHD and autism.

autism,smokesmagoats,2019/02/17,"Im pretty certain my daughter is autistic, advice? What helped you be successful? My 18 month old daughter hasnt said a word in 3 months, she stopped pointing, she stopped sleeping well, she ignores her name most of the time, she's progressively making less and less eye contact with us. She's spinning more. Walking around aimlessly more. Every week her symptoms are getting more apparent. 

So what things growing up helped you to become more social and successful? My brother is also autistic but he wasn't diagnosed until he was in highschool. He has friends and a job but he hasn't had a girlfriend and he's been taken advantage of by people he thought was a friend.

autism,Viola98,2019/02/17,"Confused by friend's behavior Hi all,

I've been having a lot of anxiety about my relationships lately. It feels like people are not making an effort to communicate with me and I have to do all the emotional labor and it is giving me a lot of anxiety. I've had one friend for like, 15 years. We used to be best friends but I'm pretty sure I'm not her best friend anymore as we only get together maybe once a month. Lately I feel like she hasn't been real with me when I ask her how she's doing and therefore I can't tell her about my problems. I sent her a message asking how she was doing this week because she had a problem at work and also about plans for a future convention we're going to (she told me we should room together and then I found out she's rooming with other people, which is fine, I just wish she hadn't said that to me if she already had other people in mind) and she hasn't responded to me after four days. This is unusual. She also hasn't acknowledged anything I've done on social media or the group threads with our mutual friends since I sent the message. I feel like she's been pulling away from me lately and I know there's nothing I can do about it, but then she'll send me a message saying how wonderful I am, but then she'll blow me off when I try to make plans with her. I am so confused by her behavior and I wish if she didn't want to do stuff with me she would just come out and say it because that hurts a lot less than the anxiety of her not responding to me and me wondering how I can talk to her about it without her getting defensive. Am I the problem or do you think she's dealing with social anxiety and that's why she's being inconsistent? I don't know. People are so hard.",3.1911165565736224,4.138057011080335,4.69757617728532,86.11330652034947,73.07202216066483,7.880715959940338,25.79597272533561,8.263242389622931,1.481106030257831,1355,43,291,21,26,455,166,361,0.087,0.762,0.151,0.979,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,4,1,0,6,18,20,1,2,14,0,39,0,0,8,3,74,67,32,0,10,13,0,4,4,5,4,0,3,2,0,14,24,0,1,10,0,0,6,11,7,0,2,15,7,63,13,41,46,8,29,1,1,0,0,59,9,0,11,18,216,77,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09482279400674616,0.13743189012857945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26293626929815395,0.0,0.08521668596532077,0.0,0.0,0.07071075823062864,0.0,0.16066065196180207,0.0,0.08073142621726931,0.0,0.0,0.1047608384078335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18035057518443487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07401866811241338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05541593079828912,0.08858716276093616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08793335155278273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09665652645369124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034211155960784,0.18415921118789708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421473178464901,0.33193568015762226,0.0,0.08978682348278799,0.0824291931365176,0.04883440388019938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697388695807518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919868371167076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09444667598209673,0.0,0.29078884872370664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1679187442731005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21915667968457694,0.0,0.0,0.11471413690386305,0.0,0.08632541460092746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676196967260645,0.0,0.06858626552644098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244945899292483,0.0,0.0,0.09150965600745052,0.05822648967719168,0.06535150217746058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23828438507264085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08741884649508798,0.0,0.2466621564622854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780395730106166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09225364774893506,0.0,0.0,0.08173643751379983,0.13666550521232498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07107986185896001,0.0,0.0,0.17518390405434572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09836607789355864,0.0,0.0,0.08098536233899288,0.0,0.0,0.06906502273533173,0.07510415393079035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0550586755797127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821071150813363,0.0,0.05833892352485511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742135057082699,0.0,0.0,0.05068208462998252,0.0,0.06892561104264111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07753592641233348,0.0,0.19762406224443865,0.08283074757244235,0.18636875043852089,0.06255601977069672,0.0,0.0,0.061040212417297436,0.0,0.0,0.0553342949510775
autism,twilldy,2019/02/17,"A letter to my father. I'm hesitant to hit send. Okay, I just want to preface with this: I'm trying to only get you to see a different perspective, not force my views on you. Whether or not you change your mind, that's up to you. Your views likely won't change, and I understand. You have made your thoughts clear multiple times. 

The one thing that you said yesterday that really upset me was that you regret getting us vaccinated when speaking to us in the heat of the moment. And when we asked what you meant by that, you couldn't give an answer. That hurt. It left me confused. I didn't know what you meant by it, but what I could gather from the context of our conversation was that you felt some kind of shame. Why else would you say that? I have autism. Your son doesn't. It didn't make sense to me.

I'm not expecting an apology. I just want you to know that what you said hurt. Maybe you didn't mean it. Maybe you just spoke out of pure emotional reaction. I want to give the benefit of the doubt. You as a parent can make the decisions you want to shape your children's lives; ultimately it's up to you, and then when they're a little older and have some autonomy, the children. I know you said you only avoid one vaccine, the one for MMR. I don't  want to have a debate. I just want to show you what I have read and seen and lived, for you to take that in with an open mind, and that's it. 

One of the major issues I have regarding this ""vaccines cause autism"" belief is what it, in direct and indirect ways, does to people with autism. How neurotypical people with little information and/or a negative view on people with autism treat them. I will send you videos and articles of autistic people speaking for themselves. Of people that lead relatively typical, average lives. Of parents that care for their autistic children and celebrate their child's different way of taking in and taking on the world around them. Of the challenges they all face. I want to show you that autism does not come about suddenly the next day, as you implied with the story of your cousin's child who you said was vibrant and alive and then completely changed the following day after he got a vaccine. Autism shows itself over time and is usually diagnosed around the time children would normally get vaccinated. The vaccines don't cause it. The symptoms show on a spectrum, where you get people that can't live on their own, need a caretaker, maybe just need some classes that help them develop their own life skills so they could live with minimal to no assistance, or sometimes they don't get any of that at all but they do still face some challenges, like I have. 

When many people think of autism, the picture that comes to mind are the kids that can't speak, that can't take care of themselves, that make ""strange"" movements with their hands, that rock back and forth, that throw tantrums all the time because they're going through intense sensory overload. That's the picture that is painted much of the time in the media. I understand that image seems daunting to other parents. I understand it can be difficult for some to care for a special needs child, financially and emotionally. Children as a whole are challenging to raise as it is. 

But they're children, they're human in the end like everyone else, and they deserve respect and love once the people who have them bring them into this world... whether they planned for those children or not.

autism,sleepayearstraight,2019/02/17,"A conflicted parent looking for advice from people on the spectrum. Please. My kiddo is 6, and was screened over a year ago, and we are trying to get her into a more extensive evaluation to be sure we are getting her the best help we can. Anyways we had great progress going this school year with school and at home. She stopped nearly everything at home (the cussing, aggressive behaviors, etc.) and the teacher had told me she stopped doing it at school too for about 2 weeks.

Now comes the whole case of visitation with a dad who was MIA most her life being implemented as well as perhaps some extra stress at school from some of the other kids. I can't be certain. The only thing I know is that home life routine stayed the exact same. Suddenly she went back to every behavior we had worked hard to get through, but even got worse. Yesterday she punched me super hard in the stomach. She's trying to bite people now. She NEVER did that before!

Dilemma ensues here because I am weighing all my options. I don't know what's better for regression - whether I should push her a bit or start the cycle over. I really don't want to go back to the beginning with her but it seems to be the only way she's calm right now. She fights me really hard otherwise.

I am also considering the other option of inquiring about medications finally, which makes me cringe really hard because I don't want to drug my kid unless I truly believe it will help her. I have an inkling that she has a bit of ADHD and/or OCD working against her too.. someone I know who works as a psych nurse gave me a bit of feedback on that. I can tell that her brain hurts sometimes and it's hard to see her go through it. 

Everyone throw your best advice and opinions my way - tell me stories like ""I wish my parent hadn't put me on medications because x, y, z."" or ""I am glad my parent did because it helped me out in the long term.""

Also, should I just wait this out until I can get into the more extensive evaluation? It takes FOREVER. I worry about her school life too and the fact that she is doing worse there. I want her to be included more with homeroom activities and not just kids that are also on the spectrum, so she doesn't feel left out. If she continues like this she might miss out on field trips.. etc.

Basically, I just don't want my kid to hate me and ultimately I'm going to have to make my own decisions, but wanted to get some opinions of people who have gone through what she is before I do.

autism,eh_whatever01,2019/02/17,"I feel like people dont wanna talk to me, but I cant tell I feel like a lot of the people at my school dont wanna talk to me, i just feel unwanted in groups when i try to talk to people.

For example, I was in cross country, and now that the season has ended, when i go to this group that has a bunch of people i know from cross country, no one talks to me, and when i try to talk if i am not immediately interrupted, it seems like people just turn away from me.

I have brought this up with my other friends and they just say Im worrying too much and that im probably just imagining those things.

I also feel that when i try to talk to people they just wanna be anywhere else, and in slightly bigger groups I feel like the atmosphere is colder.

Idk what to do, this may just all be in my head",4.05370588235294,3.660818723529413,5.477647058823528,86.0694117647059,70.58823529411767,8.682352941176473,25.235294117647058,8.238735603445708,1.1954588235294108,613,14,143,8,10,208,85,170,0.059,0.833,0.108,0.8455,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,2,0,13,5,0,0,5,0,13,1,1,0,1,30,23,12,0,5,9,0,5,4,1,1,0,1,0,0,12,6,0,0,8,0,0,4,5,0,0,1,2,6,23,5,26,18,4,19,0,0,0,0,14,8,0,4,11,106,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08738803374055384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10266846496249504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2561414805114383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128613452974133,0.0,0.09678616321045487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2762663219851276,0.2342005388394941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08442642065147826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062104108878805936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121487740207438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23607381504873756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06005527028468249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2135470723204091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09290260700931208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08033048495428974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07404829315443295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45454960700372704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11781808585645345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690071692596855,0.0,0.1105932168639836,0.0,0.09948083005354616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5269917948249647,0.09551210176356026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259816531272817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22257383548787224,0.1188609848035769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109751535248896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,the_dyl_pickle,2019/02/17,"Id like to give this non profit organization sone attention Hello /r/autism! I wanted to make a post here because I'd like to bring some attention to a really great organization. 


https://www.speclabs.org/

Spectrum laboratory is an organization that focuses on giving people on the spectrum the ability to enhance their creative skills. Offering classes such as voice acting, animation, film, etc. 

Why am I making this post? 
I have a brother who is on the spectrum who struggled to find anything for people on the spectrum that he could actually enjoy. My city offers literally nothing except maybe janitorial work for people with disabilitys and I find that this does not get any attention at all. 

Its been posted here maybe once or twice but I'd really love to see more attention going to this.

autism,mantispose,2019/02/18,"7 year old autistic girl and abuse? I'm very lost in what to do here. My 7 year old daughter is autistic. She witnessed her biological father (who I left him when she was a few days old, because he was physically abusive and the abuse caused her to come early), hit his own father. There was blood, and though it happened in the summer- we only learned of it recently, and she has been talking about it. I'm required by law for her to go with him in the summer. CPS/CAS was notified, but deemed everything safe... And we we're never told this happened or contacted by CPS/CAS. And were not told this happened by her biological father either- it was one of his other family members who told us.

 Since the summer my daughter has been hurting her siblings and thinking it's ok... CPS/CAS closed the case as fine (though stuff like this has happened before... They just keep saying it's all fine). I'm not sure what to do anymore. She is not safe with him... She tells us what happens. She has been locked in rooms and hit. She has told us about inappropriate touching. 

We've called CPS/CAS ourselves before and they do nothing. They talk to her biological father and then he lies and they say they don't know who is telling the tuth... What do I do?? Who will listen to me and my daughter? Should I go to the police? She is scared of him. And so am I.

autism,wubbalubbadubsub,2019/02/18,"Fingernail picking?? I look after a man who is somewhat high on the autism spectrum.. he picks his nails when he doesn’t have his hands full and this is my worst nightmare.

autism,gatti1996,2019/02/18,"Availability and Disparity in Early Intervention Access Statistics &amp; Reports? Hi all,

For a policy paper I'm trying to do a report on access to early invention for autism/ASD and contributing factors to whether a person gets early intervention such as gender, location, age/generation, wealth, race, other diagnoses, parental attitudes, etc. 

This is a topic I have a personal passion in as I feel my life today is much easier because of the help I had as a small child. Good data specifically on this topic seems hard to come by. Does anyone have any good resources for this kind of paper?

autism,peakedattwentytwo,2019/02/18,"SSDI for PDD NOS/ formerly Asperger's? Couldn't manage a post that satisfied anyone at Asperger's/Aspergirls, so I will try this here. I'm old, and have struggled with just being in any work environment my whole working life. Miserably underemployed at a bookbinding shop. Not enough tech skills to go freelance. Tried for a decade NOT to work and accepted being a homeless addict 3 times in that period. 

In KY; want to return to the Philly metro. Despite having held my job for nearly 4 years, is there a chance I might get SSDI without having to voluntarily become homeless again? I'm 54, w back problems and major depression and anxiety. Clean from benzos and recreational other stuff 5 years. Have no one willing or able to support me while I wait to be approved. 

The social bullshit of every job I've ever had has been overwhelming and awful, driving me to substance abuse and other forms of self destruction too numerous to count, or to lay out here. I just can't go to this, or any other, job anymore. I have enough wherewithal to live on 1200 a month and Medicare.

Thanks, I hope.....",5.5423432343234325,7.268015148514856,6.0768514851485165,75.48019471947197,68.30693069306929,9.149042904290429,30.298349834983497,9.558583805096642,3.0162801320132018,868,34,146,19,15,281,138,202,0.145,0.753,0.101,-0.9074,4,0,0,0,1,0,31.0,0,0,0,5,10,10,1,3,8,1,17,2,0,0,1,27,28,13,0,4,8,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,1,8,10,0,2,1,1,1,3,6,6,0,1,3,0,10,4,28,18,5,24,0,3,0,0,2,8,0,5,12,101,18,7,0.1393438813291389,0.16509971369493442,0.0,0.15190539857814495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18951723521821767,0.0,0.106597687815816,0.0,0.1381916874606461,0.0974324817319512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10714684355762646,0.0,0.0,0.15389436923528052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12001668080619787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28795895676079303,0.0,0.0,0.12604451824996646,0.11740322987212146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07280142678786541,0.0,0.15838467788071006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13839991521032674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4148319033166771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09842270427091776,0.0,0.0,0.12304320011187996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14782183775924415,0.0,0.0,0.11122295665874572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462179632911003,0.0,0.09442302023661804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334529201068492,0.0,0.0,0.13333327562975486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.145366057997599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14204353902629982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14567247956548238,0.15951540639034115,0.0,0.15812578523260498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12828912448699248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125253777683095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18921069729977888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08218863148340218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15557246724709814,0.0,0.13432252910328882,0.0,0.3043320155556901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17946578201471894

autism,ItsFalco,2019/02/18,"NT guy here, need help approaching autistic classmate Okay, this is kind of a long story and English is not my first language so bear with me. Yesterday I went on a field trip with the photography club at my college to the local woods, after a while setting up my equipment, I saw some dude just... Staring at me and inspecting my stuff. Now normally I get a *little* angry when random people touch my camera without my permission (think Heavy in that tf2 short) , but I could tell something was off. He wouldn't answer when I asked him why was he touching my camera or what his name was, so I took a deep breath and politely explained to him it was my equipment and if he could leave it alone for a sec. Now, that should've been the end of it, but for the entire trip he was expressing interest on me (mostly by following me at all times). Clearly he wants to interact with me but didn't know how. So I tried a couple of times to approach him and do some small talk. (stuff like ""hey I also like Canon... Etc"") but I mostly got really short responses and when he already knew what I was going to say, he would just answer before I finished my sentence (I find that kinda cute) and looked really tense. I can tell he has genuine interest in me because he's around me when I'm at the club and tried to compliment me once (""I really like your leather jacket"").

What should I do to let him know its OK to talk to me and to be more social with me? I may look ""intimidating"" because I'm older and what not but I want him to know that he can chill with me.",4.942988661364018,5.098047225080389,5.7049382298189215,83.31494330682014,68.71061093247589,8.862480961245558,28.265527161956328,8.6894789155246,1.8961729903536968,1201,37,250,18,19,393,167,311,0.035,0.856,0.109,0.9758,0,1,1,0,0,0,44.0,0,1,0,1,15,10,0,0,12,2,23,1,1,1,2,57,44,27,0,10,12,0,3,3,0,4,0,1,0,1,15,16,0,0,9,2,0,8,5,0,0,1,13,8,44,10,35,23,7,42,0,0,4,0,31,17,0,9,19,171,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13498332816878236,0.1438231988558479,0.1042254358255436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11602197933964012,0.12184163701065645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15889680379554355,0.0,0.11090184993021872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20811696186342354,0.14420847122993294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154343405006783,0.0,0.14535321271710164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119119923944499,0.11085925037134277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06809242600192318,0.0,0.07406995600413356,0.0,0.1042373888512934,0.0,0.0,0.12904791095497312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0873579394992117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13571939702912272,0.2148790784431093,0.0,0.0,0.13800142232447185,0.0,0.1332719992131902,0.0,0.1910190308315758,0.1306256282298045,0.0,0.11533859271363907,0.21888997321011666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09663858314805177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12769644127689553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387979714271385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09035491639306596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2504796043513252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10364422573062307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13285576391768952,0.0,0.10033496153884323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29839500364329274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20950980411188008,0.2278296010750281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08351066776282991,0.0,0.0,0.15199379078541686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14480223392386066,0.17697201790013484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537448798576489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12081789027202615,0.11760321006866828,0.0,0.0,0.12563417060503798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09258320956110602,0.0,0.0,0.0

We're not about to jump on the anti-vacc train, but I would like to ask this community their thoughts on the heavy metal portion? Have you found anything in the detox arena to be beneficial? Anything that scientifically proves/disproves some of those theories? Very new to all this, so thank you for your patience and understanding.

autism,iusuallypostwhileipo,2019/02/18,"Struggling to get along with my partners son and see others also struggling and worried about him picking up on it. Looking for some advice I guess? So my partner and I have known each other for almost 6 years now, we were friends in the beginning and then fell out of contact for a few years but now have been dating for the past 6 months. My partners son is 6.5 years old and is in the process of going through his diagnosis (we get the results back next week and they've  been going through the process for about a year), however all indications from the professionals are that he is high functioning but somewhere on the autistic scale and also has adhd (not sure of the exact medical terms but that's the basic gist).

Some of his more obvious and unusual behaviours are that he can't really keep up a conversation, and he is obsessed with crashing things and jumping on stuff and making crashing noises and hates to wear clothes. He also doesn't really listen to authority figures or want to participate in any family time. To get him to do something he doesn't want to do his mom has to basically beg and negotiate with him, which I think is really unhealthy because I think he is losing respect for her as he is figuring out there is no or little consequences for ignoring her or not listening. He also throws tantrums of varying severity that at his age now are containable but if they continue in afraid will end him up in serious legal trouble if they continue as he gets older.

Sadly I also feel like sometimes his mom is giving up on trying to integrate him into the family as he is basically allowed to do whatever he wants so long as he's not creating a scene, for example he puts car crash videos on the TV and will spend literally hours being naked and jumping and flopping on the couches and making crashing noises. But I can't blame his mom because how does she spend time with a young boy who isn't really able to connect with her? But then again I don't think it's good for him to isolate and be allowed to have the run of the place and not learn boundaries. When I'm there I try to have fun with him sometimes and we play catch and I let him play with my bike and video games and stuff but he doesn't really like me very much. 

And to be honest I can't blame him for not liking me because although I take him places and have fun with him I am quite strict and think he should behave at the dinner table and not scream and hit when he doesn't get his way and be a well mannered young man. His dad isn't in the picture and is kind of a dick anyways from what I understand so even though Im not trying to replace his dad I do want him to have a positive male role model and know he has someone to count on. The issue is when I do tell him to do something, like remind him to use the toilet (because he gets so engrossed in his crashing videos he sometimes pees on the floor) or ask him to behave at the table his mom kinda shuts me down and makes excuses for him which he sees and so he thinks I'm being an asshole to him. He's told me a lot when he's  not even angry that he hates me and doesn't like me and wants me to leave him alone etc. 

I'm at a loss for what I should be doing here. I want to, and do, have fun with him but I think that he's kind of being left to his own devices and his mom is so defensive about it all I can't really even talk to her about him. I don't want to throw in the towel here but I need some suggestions on how to really have a good relationship with my little buddy and still teach him good behavior. Or is it just part and parcel of autism and adhd and there are going to be behavior issues like these and I just need to accept that and not think he's going to ever have a '' normal "" life? 

I don't really have a support group for this so I'm just kind of bumbling through it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",8.129588744588744,5.668675883838388,8.312920634920633,75.76700000000002,63.520202020202035,11.526176046176047,35.128571428571426,9.888512548439397,3.1092547186147184,3068,99,634,49,35,1012,310,792,0.09,0.787,0.122,0.9802,4,1,2,0,0,0,39.0,3,0,2,3,43,41,4,4,35,0,72,6,3,10,6,144,126,85,0,15,28,9,1,6,4,5,2,3,1,6,24,61,1,4,15,8,2,13,24,15,1,0,4,7,79,26,107,106,14,87,0,3,3,1,103,37,1,14,42,441,103,4,0.05917992954511385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14224554981997278,0.057829942228719726,0.0,0.0,0.05926015091632001,0.061292559275816026,0.0,0.2366308413805395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08048876291386564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05532524542142118,0.0,0.0,0.045505712861147934,0.0,0.1443021430498177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051788755151436716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052415852043266285,0.0,0.06600126495068633,0.11726335597601795,0.05353163438846294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157914139256417,0.0,0.029923150535934445,0.04227815349173838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045722266764392464,0.0,0.1855144237548387,0.05677078095328315,0.134533271049999,0.14891195138910576,0.0,0.06524608124699245,0.06519336439819465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1168558567342862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03966705931471391,0.06252684476801029,0.0,0.0,0.05828030971293111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06392447923561967,0.12353694203340555,0.0,0.05260184053320949,0.0,0.18488036930495588,0.032523741589130906,0.0,0.0,0.06266300048101645,0.06429916660890307,0.060515487522777765,0.04180053439615556,0.17347394569222085,0.11862767305907393,0.0,0.052372375363647805,0.04969623597177556,0.06620720352126247,0.0,0.050312659804948257,0.0,0.0,0.11850918753314282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05961755297234352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465540911612197,0.04723685515344829,0.0,0.04350405754562497,0.08776233578307492,0.0,0.0,0.0629385264528913,0.0,0.05798376586542778,0.0,0.0,0.06209938092192247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408609665532419,0.05649393909941802,0.0,0.0,0.12366086113743065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059492174799059626,0.0,0.06294513967274451,0.0,0.0,0.3032974260424185,0.0,0.0,0.06353709686108662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09431748359229644,0.0,0.0,0.066856475488749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050142962257444815,0.09111920206718584,0.17559139064099336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047261168180559344,0.0,0.0,0.12373542340168077,0.13549372131012288,0.0,0.06715668273390124,0.055776383230571866,0.0,0.04449594198482082,0.047566585672473606,0.051725866883411895,0.054484928050851734,0.0,0.0,0.039316515557809566,0.2654407649018099,0.058143980305160214,0.0,0.06901658566028508,0.0,0.0,0.056548958780521186,0.0,0.12053786246559665,0.0,0.0,0.06160839374877493,0.0,0.05111245805065287,0.0,0.048829639698325225,0.2443409902136811,0.046974273473931454,0.047470569802768835,0.0,0.053209863884877466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06010009111520431,0.0,0.042039723993720336,0.0,0.0,0.15243973734738886

autism,ravenkills273,2019/02/18,"Almost everything I do that doesn’t involve my hobbies is boring and idk how to change that. I’m 21 years old and the only hobbies of mine I have are listening to music, playing video games, watching movies &amp; tv, and using the internet for different things like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, etc. My dream job is to become a vocalist in a Metal band. I’ve tried to develop different hobbies in the past, such as playing sports, reading, exercising, drawing, fishing, gardening, etc., and I can’t seem to find any enjoyment in them. I can’t seem to make any friends, not only because I’m shy and introverted af (the fact that I have ASD &amp; Depression probably plays into it as well), but also because the only times I seem to enjoy talking to people is when I talk to them about my hobbies and interests. I never know what else I wanna talk about in those situations because idk how to continue a conversation about stuff I have no interest in. I don’t eat a lot of healthy foods because I don’t like the way they taste, and the only things I really eat are junk food, fast food (fried chicken, hamburgers, French fries, etc.), and anything that isn’t vegetables and/or certain types of meat. I have no motivation to do anything, whether it’d be getting a job, exercising, going on a diet, learning how to drive (which I haven’t learned yet), etc., and the only things that seem to keep me happy are the hobbies I mentioned above, but even then it feels like it’s not enough to make me happy. I don’t know what to do. Even if I do try to get a job and do those other things (all of which I’ve done and/or tried to do), I’ll still feel unhappy and unsatisfied because I don’t really find enjoyment in anything that doesn’t involve my hobbies.

autism,let_it_snow_day,2019/02/19,"Helping a student who has difficulty transitioning Hello Everyone,

I have a student (elementary) who is super bright and high functioning but oftentimes this can cause problems with how their behavior is perceived (because a lot of staff and adults think they are just ""acting out"" or ""behaving badly"" rather than demonstrating ASD symptoms). As a result of this and many other complicated factors (red tape and such), this student does not have a 1:1 aide despite the parents fighting for one. I have 23 kids and 2 aides who do the best they can but this student still has a really tough time transitioning from preferred things like free time or recess back to non-preferred things like instruction. I really like this sub for the different perspectives and was wondering if there's anyone that has any feedback or advice on how I can help this student succeed more frequently when it comes to transitioning in the school setting?

&amp;#x200B;

 so i'm a 21 year old gal with aspergers, who is doing college right noo, and i am doing okay and quite good, but yesterday i had my first communications class , and i HYPER STRUGGLED and i had to sit out of class cause i was getting super flustered anxious and really on edge, i know aspergers has a bad issue with communications and i wonder if it was flaring up, cause each time i was trying to concentrate on it, my attention was cutting out and i was going mind blank. 

&amp;#x200B;

i had something with caffine earlier, but that had been making me yawn for some reason , and ofc my meds, but just ? idk

&amp;#x200B;

the class is focused around stuff like what advertisers and other media things use to communicate to people, and just.. deciphering it all was a super mess for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

autism,lonewolfey1,2019/02/19,"Autism and anxiety... I really need help! I have ASD as well as anxiety and tourettes. This becomes an issues when I cant tell a meltdown/sensory-overload from a panic attack. I'd appreciate if someone could explain either what these are to them individually of compare/contrast them for me. 

Additionally, I have a hard time telling stimming from a tic because they often feel similar. To make this worse, I sometimes unintentionally begin stimming off of a tic (I that makes any sense).

autism,Otter_Limits,2019/02/19,"Explaining things to people that you know, in such a way that you come across as dumb because you forget about theory-of-mind and that other people might lack your understanding and reasoning Stop me if this sounds familiar: I often find myself explaining things to people in a way that makes me look dumb. Normally, when I converse with people, I often forget that I am already aware of all the context required to reach the conclusions I am trying to make and that they most likely don't know all or anything about what I am talking about, and therefore when I talk confidently about something--in a matter-of-fact way--it annoys me that they don't comprehend my ""self-evidently"" logically-deduced train-of-thought. 
It's not that I'm dumb (or I hope I'm not dumb, because a person can never be fully aware of how much information about a topic they don't know), instead it's that I often forget about theory-of-mind and that humans can't mind-read and get all the context they need in any given conversation immediately. It's not until I've made a fool of myself or just come across as stupid that it finally dawns on me that I forgot to establish foundation or that, even if they have the same amount of background as I do, I should not assume they reach the same conclusions.",22.795,8.097207686991872,19.61913821138211,42.03358536585368,53.4308943089431,22.932032520325212,62.61463414634146,14.554592549557764,8.191849756097563,1025,33,186,20,5,334,122,246,0.141,0.823,0.036000000000000004,-0.9729,0,0,1,0,0,0,32.0,0,4,6,3,16,9,6,0,11,0,13,0,0,6,4,59,32,19,0,7,11,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,2,22,9,0,3,12,0,0,2,9,7,0,0,3,2,29,2,26,26,9,16,0,0,1,0,19,6,4,13,7,136,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14972597270221855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09226687938249767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11165286962372202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16541822666179684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2337521731423631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08961519206852563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14863052887659384,0.12400882905323594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07088706688418399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13476060125672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22369811886535365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06628627004872993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11393681413836353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283834554930207,0.1811345669629224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393476834892366,0.41099359406770414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0997402242225277,0.10060481186285301,0.10464458387762653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13293734274369814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762530065525478,0.11847032008378575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13571646205093912,0.0,0.0,0.13950137547980834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14154356488084022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11343434231146468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21810847944456652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18027918767217566,0.0,0.0,0.1077145621022674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211764072821807,0.0,0.0,0.14124739974077538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32308879906661264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,leodamascus,2019/02/19,"What's your autism story? Hello everyone! I'm Leo and I'm in the autistic spectrum. I asked the mods if I could tell you about a new sun I made, and was given permission. So here it goes.

I know several of us have been struggling with people who have inadequate exposure to autism. Our way of thinking, and the life differences that entails can make it difficult for those people to understand our or our families' lives. I want to solve this problem, and my new subreddit is my attempt to help bridge that gap in understanding.

It's over at /r/talesfromautism. I figured that since a lot of our stories were stories of awkwardness (a characteristic which is a comedy staple) that our stories could fit into the mostly funny, sometimes intense through other emotions, style of other ""talesfrom[whatever]"" subreddits. My hope is to appeal to neurotypical people with those funny stories, while also making sure that we, the people affected by autism, are in control of the narrative, so our perspective comes across and people will understand better what it feels and looks like to be autistic.

I have already posted a story of my own on that site of a time when I clearly missed a social cue rather spectacularly, and posted a thread with prompts showing what kind of stories might be appropriate for the subreddit. I welcome posts by anybody autistic, whichever level you are, or anybody who has a personal connection with an autistic person to tell your story. I have some rules on the sidebar to keep bullying and other unwelcome behavior to keep the subreddit a positive and constructive place, but other than that, feel free to post any stories you feel would help people understand the autistic community better. And I hope everybody will come and check it out!

**TL;DR: I made a sub at /r/talesfrom autism. Please share your story to help spread awareness while also having a good time!**",7.596561736770692,8.987533053731344,7.361770691994572,69.40379579375849,63.23880597014926,10.389416553595659,35.82428765264587,10.436869588844218,4.1474776119403,1523,69,233,36,22,483,182,335,0.047,0.7909999999999999,0.162,0.9891,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,8,6,0,4,8,17,0,2,23,0,23,1,0,6,2,56,49,22,0,9,5,0,3,1,0,4,1,0,0,2,25,20,0,3,10,1,2,2,0,6,0,0,6,4,30,12,43,35,4,29,0,1,1,0,28,15,0,9,8,172,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019439265153933,0.14775293909967205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06282175231067727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08636308320731348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16340568545113265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15915484756296705,0.0,0.0,0.10361232947099562,0.1475162590986211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09651772132731393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10391537112191863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827330805762994,0.0,0.0,0.08708789810949093,0.0,0.14013072259554507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07748418857985674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18576164559730984,0.0,0.0,0.18350890742260276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16422365942432762,0.0,0.0961998366572126,0.05076978113119632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06525091759950152,0.04513233422945805,0.0,0.08157347200682019,0.0,0.07757616129180271,0.0,0.0,0.0785384030747312,0.0,0.17482489265376253,0.12332909682003447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980008690727004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1784428832799063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3842690899808767,0.1613257791805633,0.09651772132731393,0.10140579656769423,0.0,0.0,0.3538990544025489,0.0,0.0,0.08839544336681568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10436341152400846,0.0,0.07641791501691671,0.0,0.0,0.09417005282677793,0.0,0.0,0.09136645043267756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657591742732677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706731238610645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16148885781147865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05919354767097228,0.0,0.0,0.10773535814729636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3846844813839204,0.1111220918419152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054488277478918164,0.07332715937779621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06562429418300264,0.0,0.0,0.0

The blanket is so wonderful.,3.618235294117646,6.20138062745098,6.203686274509806,68.75258823529413,76.05882352941177,10.354509803921568,35.69019607843137,10.355215969177356,4.927694901960784,216,13,35,8,5,77,37,51,0.041,0.711,0.248,0.9008,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,5,0,9,2,0,0,0,6,15,4,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,4,2,6,2,4,9,1,6,0,1,0,1,1,3,0,3,4,33,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5279862558780987,0.0,0.0,0.13645876606102214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13184908757334712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24357603923043555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.198391877359123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18709989102649985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17289118861970504,0.0,0.2664726312704662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32863951808554265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5853438174249181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Eclipsekiller,2019/02/19,"Been having a lot of meltdowns recently and I feel pathetic I feel like a toddler. I've been crying over the most stupid things, from taping a picture wonky into my portfolio, to not having enough spare change in my pocket to buy a kit-kat. Everyone around me says grow up, and they're right. 15-year-olds don't behave like this, do they? Most of the time this week I've been lying on the floor screaming like a child who's been refused ice cream for dinner. I don't know what to do...if something goes wrong I'm bound to cry.

autism,AngrilyUnderstand,2019/02/19,"How to communicate with an autistic person? Hey guys,

Recently, I got into an online argument with someone whom I strongly believe is an autistic individual. There's some lasting antagonism from our encounter and, as my posting here would suggest, I'd like to resolve it. I reached out to him via private message but was met with adversarial responses and empty threats.

I've tried approaching him cordially, but that strategy hasn't been effective. I'm eager to better understand how to properly interact (as not to cause negative emotions) with him and others like him. Does anybody have any tips? Please additionally let me know if I need to change my tone, nomenclature, etc.

Many thanks!",7.216666666666669,9.41945466666667,7.605,64.28666666666669,64.83333333333334,11.0,40.833333333333336,10.980518767755715,5.427833333333335,560,33,82,17,9,183,92,120,0.116,0.682,0.202,0.8983,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,1,0,0,4,4,8,1,0,3,0,7,0,0,4,0,24,14,10,0,3,4,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,2,4,10,0,0,4,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,4,0,12,7,16,8,2,6,0,0,0,0,13,2,0,2,4,56,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14631227326160698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24240517090219316,0.0,0.1902864567036507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22102268973419906,0.2276046763217068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18828294090454045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420195810597813,0.0,0.0,0.2399538709126559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17207851468254992,0.0,0.0,0.21303654173165906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182431533199538,0.17537943636773082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200098057530647,0.0,0.21022700500483554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2181326476186793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595341559530681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18786439902915988,0.0,0.2361747654594108,0.0,0.0,0.20605830484757695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21243887317985585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18229950443663387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19808513370111505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14607561795352367,0.0,0.0,0.2239831701979507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528394116677904,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,idabakedacake,2019/02/19,"Writing an article about autism and homeownership and have questions I am a freelance writer who is pitching an article about becoming a homeowner when you have autism. My idea started when I found out there was an Autism Housing Network that specifically provided resources for prospective buyers.

Hoping I can ask a few general questions and perhaps even interview someone for the piece.

1. What features in a home or neighborhood were important to you because they specifically supported your needs as an autistic adult? 

2. How was the process of working with a realtor and a broker for you? 

3. Was there an adjustment period for you once you moved and do you enjoy being a homeowner?

And anything else you would like to share. I want to make sure I'm writing with accuracy and insight so I appreciate your time.

autism,Afghaniscran,2019/02/19,"We're helping my GFs sister find a job and having no luck. I'm not sure if this is the right place or not, sorry if it isn't. Also on mobile and I've read that it causes formatting issues. 

tl;dr - GFs sister closes off when we try to help her find a job and need advice on how to coax her into communicating with us about what she's happy doing. 


My gf's sister has moderate autism (or that's the phrase they use, I'm not sure if it's the proper term.) She's been living with us for 2 years and we have supported her as she went to university. We learnt last year that she had stopped going and hadn't done any of her exams. She told us she didn't want to go to university anymore and wanted to find a job and continue living with us rather than her mum. 

So now for the past year she's been applying to jobs and not getting any responses. And we've signed up for jobcentre in order for her to get someone for professional to help her find what she needs. 

My problem is that when it comes to talking her through application forms and interviews and making choices for what she wants to do she completely shuts down and cries until we stop talking about it, then she goes back to her normal self after an hour or so. 

I don't really know what to do, I'm hoping someone here might have an idea of how we can help her more through the process of finding a job or how to get her to talk without closing us off.

We applied for PIP (disability funding) in order to maybe get funding as we knew it would be difficult for her but when the interview came around she wasnt her usual self (I don't blame her for that ofc) and was informed she wouldn't get funding as she had no problems communicating or looking after herself. 

Any help is much appreciated, and apologies if I've said anything out of hand.

autism,Siara_99,2019/02/19,"Trouble eating a box of different flavored chocolates? So i was kind of wondering if i'm the only one having trouble eating a box of chocolates. I realise it sounds kind of stupid but let me explain.  


I get so worked up about eating which flavor when. Do I eat the disgusting ones first so all that i have left are the good ones. Do I eat all the good ones first, but then im left with all not so good ones. Do i eat one good one, one not so good one, one good one etc.   
I can get so worked up about how to eat and in what order to eat them and I didn't even start about the different textures they all have. Which is anxiety inducing itself.  


Feel free to have a laugh about it, i am too sitting here laughing next to a box with 3 not so good looking chocolates left (not sure what they are filled with so I don't have the courage to eat them).

autism,Somedood12345,2019/02/19,"Things about me I am an aspie, my mood is usually numb (sometimes worse during school). I still enjoy actives such as gaming, ect. But I rarely feel crazy happy over things. I literally was so happy and ecstatic during the school holidays because I learned how to mod Fallout 4. Anyways, making friends at school is hard. I don’t want to come over to their places, because of the fear of being rejected. But I can gladly say that my sister is a very important person in my life.

autism,____Joshua,2019/02/19,"Autism Spectrum Quotient - Overlap with other communication difficulties. Leading to poor diagnosis? Hello,

Sorry if the title does not make much sense. I am not sure how to precisely word this topic.

\-----preface-----

I have often wondered If I am on the autistic spectrum, but I have never had a formal diagnosis. I am currently 22 years old.

I just took an online Quotient, and this was my result: [https://imgur.com/a/jg496wk](https://imgur.com/a/jg496wk)

\----question----

Now this test, really means nothing to me. Because yes the score was high. However I think I can attribute a lot of my answers to a non-autistic reason.

I have a very severe stammer, I have since I was 4 years old. It has effected my life greatly, this is because in stressful social situations I cannot speak at all. I block on every word, making no sound up to a minute at a time. Which obviously makes communicating very very hard.

Now, here is my concern. Out of the 50 questions on this test, a lot of them are about general communication/social habits. Of course my stammer has a huge impact on how I view social situations. General I avoid them at all costs, I recently quit my job as a Software Engineer because of having to talk to people. And currently I just sit in my parents house in my room all day playing computer games and reading and listening to music. This is all have done for 7 months. 0 human contact besides my family.

Now obviously this is not healthy, I have been to speech therapy courses and met other people who stammer as bad as I do, and they seem to find socializing much easier than I do. They have friends and partners ect... and I cannot even fathom how people are able to build relationships with people. So this is why I think on-top of my stammer causing my issues, I may also be autistic.

However I am unsure, I do not really have any issues in understanding humor or anything like that. I am not insanely good with numbers ect... and I do not have a major obsession. But I do spend all day alone by choice doing the same thing every day. Which I know is a very autistic trait. And I have a very hard time finding things to talk about and generally have 0 interest in talking to people. A lot of autistic traits I do seem to have, but I also wonder if most of them are crossovers because of my stammer.

I do not want to waste my GP's time, booking a diagnosis. If I am not actually autistic.

What are your general thoughts?",4.9189916789035735,6.874812854625553,5.806747430249633,75.89287200195794,70.23348017621146,8.39246206558982,30.8930494371023,8.998388855275968,2.825868526676457,1932,83,333,38,36,634,221,454,0.132,0.7979999999999999,0.07,-0.9726,6,2,0,0,0,0,95.0,0,1,5,3,16,17,0,3,20,1,50,1,0,12,10,86,67,28,0,5,18,1,2,1,2,1,1,4,1,2,18,15,0,2,17,4,3,2,12,9,0,0,9,7,54,8,49,56,13,39,0,0,1,0,26,18,0,17,19,246,72,7,0.08113641059030398,0.0,0.07917743266820061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403285191041175,0.0,0.12976951647057666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055175541487479066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06676835264560131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06774551377276936,0.1978400112596529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08334944372915809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569788177489118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07100301967619732,0.08303071799395177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05358983397918286,0.0,0.13672185061405095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07648818694891579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14831441873904852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626857895545002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805337171222,0.0,0.08945317911250189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14536457414745288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08572507248671353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09362052423819987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16937066551003602,0.08051536795734138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04459044935998148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05730904628866058,0.03963915185602036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2069378244551294,0.0,0.0,0.16247755231074448,0.0,0.0,0.08838133708666251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476230884667107,0.0,0.11928919491785613,0.0,0.06257740174829426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07785257422249124,0.0,0.17027802860237753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090092382113702,0.0,0.0,0.2812488553824283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1817826976020448,0.08629855994097746,0.08115836725530277,0.0,0.10395612448136064,0.08342174333693393,0.08011241708841796,0.08711014051997416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477270818618888,0.0,0.09166104940595696,0.0,0.06711687728083178,0.18240144997168728,0.0,0.2481250585430843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09082556892007172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09294148419987693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07647010677138377,0.0,0.0,0.19564312031963224,0.0,0.0,0.09278655661831113,0.0,0.1078068518769263,0.10397787152319532,0.0,0.0644132469836915,0.14193388049080866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09014553756153948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844658648537109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33473018014660944,0.047856357138072785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07321299059638227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17597795247526085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10449837651688304
autism,milostmira,2019/02/20,"Coping with Sound Sensitivity Any tips? We have to leave church all the time because the noises babies and small children make are painful. My son would like to be able to stay. But even if we manage to make it through, he’s unable to listen or participate. It’s all he can do to endure the sounds. He has some trouble with feeling crowded, too. Anywhere else we go, movies, theater, playgrounds, people step away/out with a screaming baby/toddler. They don’t do that at our church. 
Can anyone shed light on this ?",3.624352806414663,6.00387780412371,3.69786941580756,87.74710194730815,75.08247422680412,5.135853379152349,25.21076746849943,5.82211442006289,0.6696217640320734,405,14,75,2,9,124,76,97,0.099,0.861,0.041,-0.6966,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,4,0,1,0,2,4,0,0,4,0,10,1,0,2,2,17,15,4,0,2,3,1,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,4,7,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,3,0,0,0,6,6,1,12,13,3,7,2,0,0,0,12,3,0,3,2,45,10,1,0.29292730898948666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19920061501828965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20482158534462688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.275214849372984,0.0,0.0,0.1785657687070069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447031790494024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934757249243084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1481128489059226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16647734021121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3101677248554039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14310948684236288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3910625067366288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31169530967571196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20307891306543285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31222153616414844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17080826953078798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2080871558110532,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,sasha_2019,2019/02/20,"questions for experienced BCBA's I will be doing my bcba exam soon and will be starting a job, however, I'm kind of hesitant since I have no experience with doing the initial assessments and ABBLS or vb mapp. I know most agencies train you, but I like to get some information before starting a job. can you guys please give me a description of the whole process when you meet parents. I know the first thing is to go over the contract with them and ask them behavioral questions. How many hours do you guys put into that? also when starting the assessment, how often do you guys meet with the family to conduct it? I just like to get an idea of how everything is once I take on a client. Also, do you guys have any recommendations on how to get trained online for ABBLS? The ABBLS package is very expensive, how did you guys know what to buy for the assessments?

I've spoken to few bcba's before and I was informed that for a lot of the questions on ABBLS you can just ask the parents without doing the actual testing with the kids since most kids can't even sit still.

furthermore, how many categories on ABBLS do you guys focus on and and how many questions do you generally ask?

I would appreciate your answers.",7.0339743589743575,6.853816841880349,7.4658974358974355,73.59576923076924,64.34188034188034,10.447863247863248,33.811965811965806,10.035473477838034,3.297078632478632,967,37,176,19,13,318,119,234,0.014,0.924,0.062,0.9138,5,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,11,2,1,17,3,0,0,18,0,23,0,0,7,0,41,39,19,0,1,5,2,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,8,5,11,0,0,11,0,2,2,3,0,0,1,2,1,24,3,27,32,6,19,0,0,0,0,35,7,0,10,11,130,29,4,0.0,0.0,0.08943078183124674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465744584629289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06232068465601314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2570227481653312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15596364234223664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060529630596242376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236321845996122,0.08964487344367232,0.0863932831512906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779518668359623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14363975148108082,0.08791274233525764,0.052083081273228256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5444485076270144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025033238891214,0.0,0.0,0.10345429364402746,0.0,0.0,0.18188395514237105,0.0,0.0,0.09543254468015153,0.15109452077768604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08954471551172559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07791197907377201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27873620528987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09759727717396573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20351839906786165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10059698174183196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09212697352847267,0.4106465244476946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15161680814910505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19459710451167345,0.0,0.0731865729333517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06890446488476397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06088383220583424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561543915795077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10231663269359842,0.0,0.08834100992245296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06510087339377263,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,anonreddit44,2019/02/20,"My husband on the spectrum has anger issues, how to I encourage him to go to therapy? I’ve been married to my husband for 7 years now and we’ve been together since we were 18. We also have a young daughter whose on the spectrum. Overall our lives aren’t too bad, a little bit of financial stress and sometimes it’s stressful raising our daughter (but for the most part she’s super easy and amazing!). 

Over the last few years my husband has come to terms that he’s on the spectrum. I had already suspected when we met but after our daughter was diagnosed I think he started to realize as well. His family suspected and he narrowly missed out on a diagnosis as a child (although he would be diagnosed based on today’s standards for sure) but was diagnosed with dyslexia/dysgraphia and ADHD. He’s taken some great steps to finding his limits after about 4 years of being depressed/burnt out. He works in IT in a job he mostly loves with a great group of people who are also on the spectrum. He’s got a really good support network of family and friends. 

But, he’s always had explosive outbursts. He’s never been physically violent but he looses control and can be quite unkind. Generally it’s under times of stress, such as meeting his family and not finding an easy place to park or traveling. It often ends with him screaming at us and our daughter getting more upset.  She’s become quite conscious of his outbursts and will often tell him to “calm his body down” which is a technique we do with her. He also lashes out at her often and will yell things like “why can’t you be normal?!” Or “why don’t you understand this?!”. He loves her but often talks about her like she doesn’t understand him when it’s the complete opposite. It’s now at the point where during speech therapy she sometimes re-enacts our arguments. 

I would love for him to see a therapist for his anxiety and anger issues. But he’s fairly unwilling and at this stage, if things don’t improve I think we will end in divorce.",5.364365634365637,6.407753285714287,6.061363636363637,77.9797377622378,68.0909090909091,8.936063936063936,31.95054945054945,9.162432508145574,2.8696513486513484,1585,66,284,29,26,518,195,385,0.1,0.733,0.168,0.9892,2,0,0,0,1,0,37.0,11,2,0,6,18,27,3,4,18,0,29,7,1,2,2,64,46,33,0,4,11,7,0,2,1,5,3,3,0,1,14,26,0,2,10,1,0,4,7,11,1,0,11,4,40,16,51,26,8,46,0,1,1,3,67,23,0,10,20,200,54,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083752854562636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951261285743708,0.2163436537578428,0.0750345263569533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06898519350469802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07529406686521425,0.0,0.099593462658616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984499787818308,0.10016636934965056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0776795404654463,0.09454891723295666,0.0,0.10114122520430396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745834109920333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597401939058665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2550326807697298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16484037303296697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06967056218728483,0.0,0.047113784710383286,0.0,0.051249693476742166,0.07563622791746834,0.07212282166262722,0.19884102353977534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18824281496621345,0.08948680379030756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07350632840931083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881118994931071,0.09038109063559813,0.07962798389981518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2441649147817809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06955009725502055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835435885970397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09765295332737724,0.0,0.06251740947440118,0.0,0.09421582005551547,0.0,0.0852464564403148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19182877745565102,0.0,0.0,0.0577697249001772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185943054646166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745953844666037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17837480899251745,0.0,0.06382777742715956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3098925051791685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233184336232007,0.08499079882613564,0.0,0.0,0.07248089387623602,0.07881871307829612,0.0,0.20625062263592345,0.10470250101389154,0.11981924502006347,0.11556362000928536,0.0,0.0,0.05258296081400387,0.0,0.08547729565639836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877549706820528,0.10847188335151417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107999434654835,0.0,0.16274151607606782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564996362478666,0.0,0.0,0.12811837260534828,0.0,0.0,0.17421318351410492

autism,KillAutismOrMyself,2019/02/20,"Should there be a national map showing the percentage of women who say they “don’t date virgin men”? The Southern GOP states have the lowest percentage whereas Massachusetts and California are on top.

I think this is a message for young men with Asperger’s, most of whom are virgins (including me AND every guy with autism from high school).

autism,computersaysno1,2019/02/20,"Help with getting a diagnosis after 22 years of never feeling ""normal"" Hi Reddit, 

I'm apologising in advance if this post seems a bit sporadic and all over the place but i'm going to be writing things as they come into my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22yo guy from the UK and have never felt ""normal"". I've been great at covering it up to a certain degree (i've managed to buy my own house) but people who truly know me like my partner knows that i have meltdowns and really bad anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone recently mentioned to me that they think i may be high-functioning autism and after a lot of research, i relate with most of the points/ posts/ videos. I'm partially worried that i'm just being a hypochondriac and this is all in my head as something i want to believe to make me feel better about issues...

&amp;#x200B;

Up until now my ""meltdowns"" have always been put down to a bad temper, but it can be triggered off by many things, but most of which have nothing to do with ""temper"": Dropping an egg, something not working, too many people around me in my personal space - the list goes on, it just depends on what happens on the day. Unfortunately in the past it has meant that i have lashed out and punched things as i ""black out"" (i'm not sure how to describe it - i just lose complete control and then almost regain consciousness a few minutes later, with limited knowledge of what has happened, been said, or done.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been very shy as a child and not socialised much - instead i would draw, build things (even if they had no purpose) or just find something and play with it. As i've gotten older i'm struggling more and more to go out, socialise with people and enter busy shops without my partner as she is the only one that understands me. Big crowds of people make me just want to hide and cry.  Unfortunately this has had a huge impact on her as she feels like she can't leave me alone and can't get time to herself.

&amp;#x200B;

As i've never been social or ""popular"" i've always tried to be a people-pleaser. Unfortunately at the moment the only person who i want to please is my partner. The only way i seem to know how to do this is by tidying the house excessively to the point that it doesn't feel ""lived-in"" (her words). I can't stop until it's done, and if it's unfinished it stresses me out. My people-pleasing is so bad that if i feel i've done something wrong, i feel useless and it's painful.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if any of this is related but i'm also very monotone in my voice - only people who know me can pick up the ""tones"" in my voice. I often get told because of this that i'm unenthusiastic, which makes it difficult to get a job.

&amp;#x200B;

I wear the same colour clothes all the time - nothing else. Blue jeans, white/ black/ grey t-shirt and white/ black/ grey hoodie. I've never really strayed out of this apart from when my mum used to buy my clothes for me as a kid...

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had the same very strong interests: growing up - Scooby-Doo (Tv, games, Cuddly-toys), drawing concept war boats and planes with the dimensions of what they would have to be, Japanese cars and graffiti. 

&amp;#x200B;

People try talking to me and i freeze up or come out with something completely random, it's almost like my mouth and brain aren't connected. I can say hello, but everything after that is just - well - not there. I feel like i know what i should say, i just can't say it - and once i've thought of what to say, it's too late. To which i will think of the conversation (or lack of) for hours, days, weeks after.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel the need to sleep a lot during the day - multiple short naps - but i can only do this on weekends as i work full time (i can't imagine my work would be happy if i started sleeping!)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not very good at showing compassion - i often get told i'm very selfish. I struggle to know what to do if i see someone crying or hurt. Instead i almost become angry inside - i don't know why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Loud, repetitive too many different noises at once can almost send me insane. It's like i just need to stop the noise - at whatever cost it is. I first ever noticed this with my mum sneezing when i was a child (she sneezes repetitively a lot). With too many noises, i just need to get out of the area as everything becomes a blur. This happens mostly in big shopping centres. an example of this might be a shoe shop where there's loud music, lot of people walking around close to me and talking, along with babies crying - i just need to get out as i feel like i'm going to burst into tears.

&amp;#x200B;

When i was in primary school (i think it's kindergarten or elementary for the US)  one of my teachers picked up that i was unresponsive during lessons. This was put down to the fact that i was 80% deaf, but all i remember doing was playing with the chewing gum that was stuck on the floor. I struggled to understand anything that was happening. To this day i do not know my ABC, times tables and struggle with the months of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this i came out of school with good grades and have a steady job and career.

&amp;#x200B;

I can only think that everything in my life is starting to make sense. There's so much more that i just haven't written, but this post would become a book. I guess my question is either what is wrong with me if i'm not on the spectrum, and if i maybe am - what are the steps i need to take in the UK to get a diagnosis?

&amp;#x200B;

\[Dealing with NT\]

I hate being autistic. I hate that I studied psychology, Everyone around me uses me as they personal therapist when they want. But when I have a different opinion on there life, base of everything that I am as a person, they judge me. “Don’t use this therapist crap on me”, ‘I didn’t ask you to analyse me” and so one.

autism,Young_ElTopo,2019/02/21,"Anyone in the LA/Orange County area know of adult social support? I'm fairly new to the LA area. I contacted a local regional center, and they set me up with a social worker and job developer. However, none of these organizations have social support for adults.

Does anyone know of groups or organizations for adults (specifically young adults) where you have made friends or found social support?

autism,OedipusTheRex,2019/02/21,"My experience with autism Mobile User.... sorry in advance:

First of all, I have always been a lonely guy since I feel so misunderstood and alienated. I’ve struggled with making friends because I only found that I had Aspergers in late 2015. When I found out I did, let’s just say my life went downhill from there. It’s time for my story:

I [18M] am “friends” with someone we’ll call C [17F]. C is the hottest girl at my school, and we have known each other since we started high school in 2015. Not much happened between us during freshman year. However, it should be noted that at some point during that school year I developed a huge crush on C.

Fast forward to September 2016, I told C I liked her through a lengthy note I wrote to her because I get shy when telling such personal feelings of mine. Anyways, C told me that the note was sweet but she already had a boyfriend (She broke up with him 2 months later).

For some reason, I didn’t take that very well. I developed an obsession with her. I was determined to make her my first girlfriend. I memorized C’s class schedule and waited outside most of them at the end so that way I could talk to her and show that I could be a better boyfriend than the one she had. I also did so many other things that I’d rather not talk about. The funny thing is that I had absolutely no idea I was stalking and harassing her... I legitimately thought that I was just being a nice friend.

That is until October. I was told by a friend of C’s to stop harassing her and obsessing about her. That figuratively “broke” me. When I got home from school that day I broke down in tears. I couldn’t believe what I had done. 

That epiphany in my life caused me to become depressed. 

The thing is, C is such a sweet person that she always was nice and forgiving to me despite my actions. That boosted my morale slightly, but has left me emotionally unstable to this very day. 

From October 2016- August 29, 2017 C and I had a rocky friendship that was relatively one-sided. On August 29, I made the idiotic decision of asking C to my school’s homecoming. To my surprise, she said that she’d think about it overnight. That response made me the happiest guy in the world. 

The hottest girl at school was actually considering going to homecoming with ME of all people!!

The next day, however, my entire world fell apart. C told me that her answer was... no. The answer was no because she didn’t want me to become even more obsessed with and didn’t want me to get hurt. When she told me that, I actually fell to my knees and cried. C was the first girl I’d ever asked to homecoming and people assured me that she wouldn’t reject me. She and I still talked after that because I wanted to move on from that incident.... but I couldn’t get over it. 

On October 1, 2017 I made a decision that changed my life. I was having a rough night filled with crying over C. I decided that I wanted to try and drown my sorrows away. I got into my parents alcohol and got absolutely wasted in an attempt to forget about C. 

Well, actions always have consequences. 

While drunk, I made a video of myself confessing about drinking because I was depressed and sent it to a friend of mine. Well, he sent that video to my school’s principal because he was concerned. It should be noted that I go to a private Christian school where drinking will get you in trouble no matter where it occurred. At school, I got called into the front office and confronted about the video. 

I confessed and was given one day of In-School Suspension (ISS). After that whole situation eventually got resolved, my school forbade me from having any form of contact with C. If I were to be caught being in contact with her I would be immediately expelled. Well, for the next couple of months I struggled to not talk to C, but I did it. After the school forgot about the agreement, I caved and resumed all contact with C.

The only condition I set forward alongside resuming our friendship was that I vowed to end my obsession with her and simply be friends.

As of now, C and I are in a semi-stable friendship. I’m still depressed and lonely.. and still have autism. 

My inability to properly interact with people has completely ruined my life. I wish things could have been different if I only I wasn’t so blind to the fact that I was harassing an innocent girl.

Summary: I was unaware that I was obsessed with a girl at school, which completely ruined my life.

autism,CyberJay7,2019/02/21,"Is 40 hrs/week ABA therapy necessary for nonverbal four-year-old? Please help because Facebook groups on autism were worthless.  Sorry this is long but I'm trying to provide as much info up front so responses apply to our situation.

My four-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with nonverbal autism.  The developmental psychologist has recommended 40 hours a week of ABA therapy.  I will do anything to help my daughter, but 40 hours a week seems excessive.  My sister, a social worker, checked with one of her friends who specializes in this area and the friend said that 40 hours of ABA is what the research says is necessary.  

Here are my concerns.  My daughter does not do most of the things that I hear ABA therapy tries to teach autistic kids *not to do*.  She doesn't flap or jump around or have outbursts, etc.  She is happy and loving and laughs a lot.  She gives hugs, she will sit on our lap when we're at a sporting event (even longer if we give her a phone to play with!), and she falls asleep in our arms every night (her preferred method of going to sleep.)  We don't have behavior issues that we need to ""correct,"" what we need is for her to connect with the world around her and try to talk, learn her letters/colors/numbers, etc.  

The things she doesn't do: she doesn't normally respond to her name. She just won't focus on things so she can learn.  Her expressive and receptive language are terrible.  She won't even try to repeat the words or sounds we say. However, she has learned to work the iPhone and play her games with no problem.  If she wants something to eat or drink she will bring it to us from the pantry or fridge to make it for her.  

Her preschool teacher (she goes for 2 1/2 hours a day) through the county specializes in kids with developmental disorders, and the teacher does not want our daughter in 8 hours of therapy, but right now the county only provides one day a week of speech for 30 minutes, and she needs a lot more than that.  I'm told the ABA centers incorporate intensive speech classes into the daily routine.  

I apologize this is so long.  I'm looking for information from people whose kids showed similar problems (and lack of problems), what you did in our situation, what you wish you did, etc.  Does my daughter sound like a child who needs 8 hours of ABA based upon your experiences?

autism,daringStumbles,2019/02/21,"Reputation at work as a high functioning individual I guess I'm looking for advice from people who may have been in a similar situation or maybe just validation. I work for a large company as a software developer. Other jobs I've had in the past and other teams I've been on at my current company, I've never had issues with my reputation. For the most part, people usually have seen me as odd and very direct but mostly harmless, and mostly nice. About a year ago, I switched under a new manager and on to a new team and I've been having a very very difficult time with my reputation. They have told me that I am too argumentative and agressive and while my technical skills are above and beyond a senior developers they can't and won't promote me to a senior developer until my ""soft skills"" are better.

 I've told my manager that I am autistic and that in the moment it's very difficult for me to tell when someone is uncomfortable with the way I'm talking. I've told them that I need immediate feedback and suggestions on how I could have handled the situation differently. Not just general ""You were too aggressive in discussing xyz project,"" when xyz project lasted almost 3 months and there were countless disscusions in which I could have stepped on someone's toes. They won't tell me who gave the feedback or any specifics of what I did, just that it was too agressive. 

But I think I've now been labelled ""a problem"". My manager has been tip toeing around my statements in team meetings, and trying to get me to put in my goals for the year around things that other people have given me feedback I've done really well with. The idea of trying to find a new job is giving me panic attacks, but so is the idea of facing my manager every morning. I'm really frustrated because I mean, I think like most people I consider myself to be a good person, not this jerk that my manager thinks I am. I feel like I've tried having an honest conversation with my manager about all this, but she just told me I was being too defensive and needed to be more open to feedback. 

Maybe by the end of writing this I've mostly convinced myself I just need a new job, but I'd appreciate hearing if people have any experience with this type of situation.",8.856889400921661,7.100273283410139,9.295119815668203,67.07125115207376,61.557603686635936,12.458801843317973,38.289861751152074,11.308507894218259,4.284207741935484,1791,72,325,41,20,604,199,434,0.073,0.826,0.102,0.8955,5,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,0,1,4,10,21,18,5,1,25,0,40,3,3,1,2,67,63,31,0,7,15,0,2,2,0,3,0,1,0,1,21,23,0,1,9,3,0,2,6,9,1,0,20,5,46,9,50,35,8,45,0,0,2,0,27,19,0,11,25,232,67,25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08074560449596249,0.07324698547219781,0.0,0.0827425469203371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11238319746037502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14711739336889074,0.0,0.09400416484999932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05037080844961419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307999514000102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319475202865242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08633132422596722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455972813342058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07318612980219408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0696197913082267,0.0,0.0,0.08082852081245942,0.0,0.0,0.04178048231298054,0.05903127219394212,0.0,0.0,0.07552281390457083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04317104516999221,0.07926674053470181,0.0,0.0693065741159449,0.0,0.0,0.091026852432917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09313062068361946,0.0,0.0,0.08730369914689043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18655963705941972,0.0,0.08624481261470253,0.24599417382604302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735491626380151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08073821316656847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693888401071614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1660269615739044,0.09000887884241562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06595490634882904,0.0,0.0,0.1838084886914189,0.06372976420024518,0.3192203504268689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969491315091198,0.0,0.08948081936092557,0.0788801974745045,0.28642805125093873,0.07214979776207488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790662644792369,0.0,0.08306651246391679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587047584712216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27864055725504705,0.0,0.0,0.1400251718281977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641529570862066,0.14444546297694774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05489605718149322,0.15883893504088914,0.0,0.0,0.048182530663324064,0.0,0.0,0.3158280769011611,0.0,0.16830213198107255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100586262944932,0.2727153874141856,0.0,0.06558827419211175,0.0,0.0,0.0742947763554671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031203022538722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10642271345040183

Our family just did paper work for my brother who's in his 20s, but they didn't give us the full price ($3,300) until 4 days before the surgery. We declined and the admin seemed to be upset with us about taking back our request after they dropped that price tag on us. He needs to be fully sedated.

Hiccup has autism. 

He is socially awkward, thinks out of the box, can't stop thinking about anything else when a thought pops in his head, can't concentrate and is inexplicably good with dragons.

autism,trubaby9,2019/02/21,"Younger sister to my Autistic brother... I want to be better Hey all, I (22F) have an older Autistic brother (28M) and I want to be a better sister to him. He is pretty low functioning, he speaks but doesn’t quite comprehend what he is communicating. He is a huge introvert and he is really attached to my mom. He loves our dad but I think he clings to our mom more. He gets nervous/angry when my mom isn’t around. I love him so much but sometimes it is really difficult to connect with him because he is so introverted. He likes to be alone. When I walk into his room or our parents room where he usually hangs out, he will cover his ears and he won’t want to talk to me. I know he likes his own space but it makes me sad when I sit next to him and he won’t want me to (or at least he acts like it). I know he loves me but I want to be a better sister. Growing up, our parents have never placed any responsibility on me with being a caretaker or anything, and I appreciate that, but I know one day I will be the primary caretaker for him and I want to establish a healthy, loving relationship before then. I would really like to seek out some advice or help from anyone who has experience with this or anything similar to this. Anything that will help me to be a better sister to him would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone.

To give you an example, parents I have spoken to were investigated for restraining their child with autism to either protect themselves, others or the child.

autism,OyVeyWhyMe2,2019/02/21,"Any low-functioning autism success stories? Hi all,

Whenever I read a story online about a person diagnosed as autistic making an accomplishment, I dig a little deeper into the story and see that their diagnosis was labeled as high-functioning.

I am not trying to take away anything from their accomplishments, but honestly there is a night and day difference between a high-functioning and low-functioning person with autism. When I have interactions with high-functioning individuals in a general group, they are not noticeably different than the whole and sometimes, particularly in the case of some symptoms of Asperger's, it can be an added benefit in certain roles such as intense obsession with details and procedure. 

I wanted to ask the group if they had any success stories for a low-functioning individual that they could share or link to. 

Sometimes I feel that it is a disservice to call this diagnosis as a spectrum, because when autism-spectrum disorder is mentioned in these success articles, it can lead to an unreasonable hope for parents as a higher-functioning child has less of a gap to cross (to integrate into society) than from the other side of the spectrum.

autism,MuteNotDeaf,2019/02/21,"[Rant] Lack of Resources for Autistic Adults when i was growing up, autism wasn’t a “hot topic”. i was suspected to be autistic but doctors were like “nah. that’s too rare. it’s probably just ADD or whatever. here’s some pills”.

i didn’t get diagnosed until i was 18 and by then, i “outgrew” all the resources for autistic people and wasn’t allowed to go. i “outgrew” the system before i could even benefit from it.  i’m almost 30 years old now and i just keep getting further away.

it feels like i don’t exist sometimes. everybody seems to just focus on children as if autism just magically disappears when someone turns a certain age.

i often get told i need to see a therapist, but that doesn’t work for me. i’ve been to many different ones my whole life. maybe i talk for a few sessions but they always end the same: me sitting there in silence for 45 minutes every few weeks.

i read about kids getting to do fun activities and stuff and i get very jealous. my whole childhood was sitting in various mental health offices in silence.

in my state, i could only find a single group for autistic adults. it is infuriating.

“Autism doesn’t end at 6”. oh yeah? well it also doesn’t end at 18!

autism,Bolticus13,2019/02/21,"How do you cope with the idea of not being able to achieve your dream job due to autism. Hey everyone.
So this wont apply to everyone but i hope some people can relate. However i was wandering if i could get different perspectives on how some people cope with the idea that they will never be able to persue their dream job due to their autism diagnosis. For me, as far back as i could remember i have always been interested in the aviation industry and had the aspiration of working as a international pilot on a major carrier to the point where during my teenage years i went on to get my pilots license and endoresements (bassically additions to the license that allow you to do more such as travel in controlled airspace and carry passenger) with the plan of becoming a pilot. 

However once i turned 20 and reality caught up to me when i found out that as a person with autism i am automatically barred from being able to work as a pilot in any industry.  Due to this it has made me incredibly depressed and unsure on what i want to do in life as this was the only thing i ever thought of doing (i know its stupid not to have a back up plan but as i am sure some of you can relate with, once i get my mind fixed on something it is very difficult for me to change it.) And to make things worse i am at an age where a whole lot of my friends are graduating university and pursuing their own dream jobs with little to no issue which just amplifys my depression as it sucks knowing that i will never be able to achieve my own dream job.

So i would love it if people who are in similar situations could let me know how they dealt with the knowledge that they would never be able to achieve their dream job and how things worked out in the end. 

Thanks.

autism,ritalinda,2019/02/21,"Is he just not that into me? Or is it his autism? Hello all, I would love to get some insights. I am a NT seeing a guy with high functioning autism. We've been very casual but he tells me he likes me, feels comfortable with me and he shares a lot of information about himself. When we see each other, things are very intense, we have a great time, but when we're not he tends to completely dissapear (does reply to my messages but doesn't keep the conversation going and shows up again after a few weeks of no contact) I am used to NT guys dissapearing on me because they aren't interested anymore, but I feel it may have something to do with his autism. What's your experience with casually dating? Do you lose interest and if you do, do you tell the person or do you 'ghost' them?",4.877884615384616,5.4073746089743615,6.000410256410259,79.82792307692307,68.93589743589743,9.316923076923075,27.779487179487177,9.3871,2.139345641025641,613,19,127,12,10,205,102,156,0.055,0.77,0.17600000000000002,0.9657,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,2,5,2,1,5,10,0,0,7,0,17,1,0,1,1,32,27,12,1,2,10,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,3,6,11,0,1,4,3,0,1,5,1,0,0,1,4,22,9,16,24,5,12,0,1,2,1,29,4,0,6,8,90,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18669976217301507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475935372415035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973832530131507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647444437275015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1841508821561892,0.0,0.0,0.19037618398827447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09835619867527373,0.0,0.10699045013325836,0.0,0.0,0.20755334491056876,0.0,0.3728068660134942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989032219295568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16733093762046009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09197256753488788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21061075677470265,0.0,0.16004885863311352,0.16990875045335002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16437822654337966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30003195332181226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449289736117155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3290887815747809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250691866590523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097738203913914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16259308501387024,0.0,0.31066249057317785,0.0,0.0,0.15100792812487068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373194477355613,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,lishabobisha,2019/02/21,"Concerns with my son (7yrs) Hey guys!

We have always had concerns with my son and his behaviour since he was very little. 
He was born 8 weeks premature and IGUR (growth restricted). From around 6mo he would hit his head on everything including concrete to the point where he would bleed. This carried on till 2, it got to a point where he used this to go to sleep or after a tantrum. He still at 7 does this sometimes, but more because he likes the feeling.

He talks A LOT and really loudly. He will tell when we are next to him (not ears checked those too). Sometimes its hard to get him to stop. It's usually about anything and everything, but he also talks about facts. He interrupts, even when he's trying to be polite by saying excuse me. His teachers at school are trying to get him to realise that others can have an opinion too.

He misses social cues, today I got an email from the school stating that he got a child with a stick because he refused to leave them alone when yelled at him to leave them alone. He's run away in the middle of the night at 6 years old because his mates told him too and doesn't seem to understand why it was a bad thing. He doesn't listen and is super sensitive and emotional. He wants to be friends with everyone and doesn't realise he can't tell his entire life story to strangers.

He's been seen by Early Intervention in kindergarten (2-3years old) and they told me that he was just a bright kid and there seem to be no issues.

I just feel like something isn't right for him and there's more going on. It took so long just to get them to listen the first time. I'm a bit lost on where to go and what I can do for him. I'm so worried he's going to get picked on at school. 

Am I justified in my concerns or just worrying about nothing...",3.7181602564102576,4.814093675000001,4.232222222222223,89.38115384615385,71.97222222222223,7.316239316239318,25.23504273504273,7.61054688173877,1.0794658119658118,1393,41,297,16,26,440,185,360,0.106,0.816,0.078,-0.7466,0,2,1,0,0,0,38.0,2,0,4,3,24,9,1,0,16,0,26,5,3,2,1,44,55,23,0,3,9,2,3,2,2,3,2,6,0,3,15,19,0,3,5,0,1,7,7,4,0,1,14,11,27,5,51,34,4,51,0,2,2,0,61,23,0,6,22,177,42,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962083345138345,0.0,0.07574972203877657,0.07881688807769459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07794872465349853,0.08432329992917617,0.0,0.0,0.08899511008734112,0.0,0.07908951157762736,0.17322626609846076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341267328037054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828924873986907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065503065591352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06256346079470364,0.0,0.0,0.09051161472054407,0.17026133938987842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09578930296648612,0.06766992748341069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08057109413399331,0.0,0.0,0.07318253567834279,0.0,0.19795483901742614,0.0,0.2153324103390292,0.0,0.2272752280379009,0.0,0.0,0.09379038146586728,0.0,0.0,0.08485294840758183,0.0,0.09721283447436757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09886590612994073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200595359457784,0.0,0.0,0.06690545583804668,0.0925534691539736,0.09493704632821716,0.0,0.08382662321533403,0.0,0.0,0.1034010343429096,0.08052986612018588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10073868343876807,0.08889085259706574,0.0,0.09088900101888046,0.0,0.1987911134563793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1790871680674968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06068179760442417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808926822025595,0.0,0.07532730592904635,0.0,0.28759333783705066,0.0,0.17246400684824778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07835560979818287,0.0,0.09479112395798417,0.09655788060084912,0.0,0.07292217477565124,0.18736637703771655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07564568363149267,0.07919243226694869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522690627308842,0.16558365831663072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06292956378090785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05523357764071616,0.0,0.08978605945861412,0.18102322944108812,0.10524042316010278,0.12862101327180214,0.0,0.0,0.09860968829122793,0.0,0.0818100140173443,0.10432368972952696,0.07815616115004731,0.055869912281277134,0.0,0.0759808494658424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854725183253798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19239103279697312,0.0,0.1345765999280724,0.0,0.0,0.06099832371997841

as managed to stop myself I sat down and started a youtube video crying on the inside for the things I just did.

autism,pinkypaz123,2019/02/22,"Teaching my autistic brother to knit Hey, 

So my brother (he's 13) is autistic and one of the things he does is fidget a lot, especially fidgeting with his hands so I thought it might be a good idea to get him into knitting since it will keep his hands busy and you can make some really nice things.

Thing is, he's very impatient and loses attention quite quickly. I tried teaching him today but he found it difficult and became fidgety and frustrated very quickly and lost interest. He did say that he wants to learn but I'm not sure how to go about it now.

I was wondering if anyone here has any ideas or thoughts- should I try again and should I try anything differently? Thank you!",2.9503470213996508,5.357123097744363,3.748872180451128,86.40716020821287,77.42105263157895,7.099826489300174,26.772122614227875,8.139509932561175,1.854306419895893,544,22,105,10,13,173,92,133,0.14300000000000002,0.779,0.078,-0.8524,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,0,3,9,9,1,0,3,0,12,2,2,2,1,32,24,14,0,4,5,2,2,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,8,9,0,1,8,0,0,1,1,4,0,1,6,3,13,5,8,13,2,7,0,2,0,0,16,1,0,6,5,67,21,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11111870370297422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11425421077035015,0.0,0.13446560911497174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17071991282919388,0.0,0.0,0.1429938572910288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17916144040920562,0.0,0.0,0.08537060139232086,0.0,0.09286490525388294,0.13705352486653133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3689210754240965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14523886616808446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828046143274573,0.1783721687281437,0.13891821255489792,0.0,0.0,0.10907184902872928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17334329483949354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107251654060023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737977345315396,0.0,0.0,0.10467926080050508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12994352530801068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13516750717761514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1540040914395461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15043825640206232,0.0,0.0,0.3256703235141173,0.0,0.0,0.2594452655349676,0.0,0.0,0.1548856280690123,0.0,0.0,0.3328169185216072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696468957470575,0.09637850804483676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1772020847660558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,somuchpanic,2019/02/22,"Mom of a newly diagnosed son, feeling overwhelmed and lost So after having a feeling for a while that my 4 year old son might have autism, we were given the confirmation about a month ago that he indeed has it. It is a moderate level of autism, and he is verbal but only uses about 3 or 4 word phrases, but never complete sentences. I was recommended to reach out  to our school district and get him into preschool but everytime I call I get transferred to the person that's ""supposed to help me"" and they are never in the office. I've left messages for them to call me back and they have not. It's so frustrating and it makes me feel helpless.

I was also recommended to start him on ABA therapy and to hold off on speech therapy for now because they think with ABA and preschool combined, he will get what he needs.  

My issue is that we were assigned a BCBA and he requires that the parent observe at least 80% of each session. I understand that I need to be able to learn things as well so I can implement them into our daily life when the therapist isn't here but I'm at a loss as to how parents can spend that much time watching the sessions if they have to work...

I work from home but my schedule is pretty much an 8 to 5 and the therapists hours are 8 to 6. Idk how to go about this. It's driving me crazy because I want to help my child but I also can't quit my job. Any advice or comments about parents who work and have their child receive ABA would be much appreciated.",4.0407198598502925,5.03094695317726,4.998977544194937,84.58199554069122,71.10702341137123,7.568147794234751,28.284917980570153,7.793537801064563,1.6524991559165474,1165,42,236,14,21,381,166,299,0.066,0.8370000000000001,0.097,0.7555,4,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,4,0,7,7,16,6,1,1,15,0,25,2,0,4,2,48,43,31,0,5,10,6,3,0,0,3,2,1,1,3,16,18,0,2,6,0,1,3,5,5,1,0,6,5,32,1,39,32,5,29,0,4,1,0,35,11,0,4,15,168,48,11,0.11273686679556764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11016516146516486,0.09993443026096538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803112632914146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07666493533287493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668769173430274,0.0,0.13744669522562328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23023389147124426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11820245992650336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11442554670509815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171009441647023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17670107957430406,0.0,0.0640709594220359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15113029084381546,0.0,0.11308426939821835,0.0,0.11102310468116497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11766799897704247,0.1118739447106826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248893563700455,0.0,0.07962938304295453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230656075441759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07525273400215889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11959600001076633,0.0,0.13203605584869155,0.08998549150377462,0.0,0.2486237062946673,0.16718591649052228,0.17389924336024884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11829837731971432,0.0,0.0,0.08574146731580974,0.0,0.0,0.3755428472033575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843748362222507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11469392316630647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11990953489231546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140957279311814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07979573457137172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25784886459219303,0.2617923830858063,0.07489736489002967,0.0722372321274337,0.0,0.0,0.06573777363436259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11736305421333462,0.0,0.09736845614961108,0.0,0.0,0.06649512494752588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10136398240262852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24622134515032934,0.0,0.0,0.0800850355928446,0.0,0.0,0.0725988459929774
autism,CarolinianRevolution,2019/02/22,"How do I develop a personality? I've gone through all of high school without really making any meaningful connections to people or having a consistent friend and now I'm on my last semester. Sometimes I would develop the cajones to converse with someone but quickly regret it when I have to carry the conversation. I am much more comfortable talking to people who are not in my age group like a teacher

I don't think I really have a personality other than my political views and taste in media, I wasn't even bullied in high school because I'm not very noteworthy or noticable.

autism,sus1tna,2019/02/22,"Friend's husband doesn't understand what autism means My best friend and her husband have a beautiful, awesome two-year-old. He had complications at birth due to a rare genetic urea cycle disorder, which caused high ammonia levels in his blood. He had a seizure and was in a coma for a short time, but has now had a liver transplant and is thriving. 

Now, at two, he is verbally delayed. He asks for things, and they understand him, but he doesn't know more than a couple words or speak in sentances. His early intervention specialist think's he's showing signs of autism. 

Whether he is or isn't is neither here nor there to my friend. Her son will be happy, healthy and loved, and if a better understanding of how he experiences and gets the most out of life would be helped by understanding where he falls on the spectrum, cool.

Her husband doesn't feel that way. He's scared and overwhelmed by the possibility. I think he has this archaic 90s Hollywood stereotype in his head about what autism is. He loves his family so much, and after going through the trauma of almost losing their son at birth, he's having a hard time hearing all of this because of what he *thinks* it means.

Could anyone possibly share some learning tools or teaching aids that might help her husband understand autism a little better?  Anything that would be easy to consume for an outsider/new learner would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, all.

autism,cokobites,2019/02/22,"Worried about my autistic adult brother (21) He's quiet and doesn't really respond when he thinks the conversation isn't necessary. He mostly mumbles or just ignores people. He can talk a lot about the things he love, such as games and cartoons. He can't really speak Indonesian, although he is Indonesian. He speaks English pretty well, but he's not so good with grammar. He doesn't really have good motoric skills and has a childlike writing. 

Now he's 21, and pursuing a diploma in animation. He failed a lot of his tests in his first semester. As mentioned before he has bad motoric skills. He doesn't have a lot of things that he's passionate about, so the family is really supporting his decision to take on animation, although we know it's going to be difficult for him. The college doesn't really care that he needs more communicative assistance than other students. 

I'm so proud of him to be able to move to Malaysia and live there independently. But I'm worried about his relationship with other people and his career prospects. 



TLDR; how do you connect with someone with autism and do you know if there are any education institution that offers art studies for people with autism. And I would like to know from the perspective of people with autism about finding the right job and their relationship with other people.

autism,patrishaei,2019/02/22,"Persons with Autism and Telling Narratives (personal or fictional) Hello! I am doing a masters in clinical linguistics. For my research, I’m interested in how persons with Autism tell stories (personal and fictional).

Most of the research concludes that there is difficulty for persons with Autism to integrate their listener’s perspective and informational needs to construct the story clearly. I want to ask your first-hand opinions on this (because this is unavailable from most journal articles).

Namely, how do you decide to include the following things when you tell stories:
-your personal evaluations or opinions on events in the story
-your interpretations of people’s actions in the narrative
-the reason you’re telling this story to others/ the whole point or “gist” of the story

Apparently these elements are what make authors judge the stories produced by children with autism as “descriptions” rather than actual narratives. 

Thank you for your insights!

autism,Mighty_Mac,2019/02/22,"I found a good alternative for weighted/compression vest for adults I was looking around for one and could only find the ones they make for small children, and they were rather expensive. I looked at neoprene (non weighted) vests, but they seem like they would get to hot. I came across this device that’s made for added weight for jogging, it has straps that can tighten down and give a good amount of compression. It’s an X shape that goes across your chest and looks cool imo, normal weighted vests look like a bulletproof vest or look like you have a bomb strapped to you. The weights aren’t changeable but they are a lot heavier than they look (I think it’s full of sand). It kind of reminds me of a weighted blanket except you can wear it anywhere.

The smell of them, the taste the texture and when it's in some kind of dish I taste it like right away. The same with chicory and leek when my parents order chinese. And I love nasi (Rice with egg, ham and leek) But before I can eat it I have to get all the leek out. I have this with so many kinds of food. Or Pringles cream&amp;onion flavour I really just hate it but my sister loves it so that's not very nice for me haha. Some people do adapt to me that I don't like many foods but some don't and they say: ""just eat it don't be so picky"" but when I eat something I don't like I almost vomit.

autism,4amsolitude,2019/02/23,"I constantly mess up my words and I don't know why I think it may be due to ASD or ADHD.

By messing up I mean I often say words that are out of context. 
E.g. 
""We will go to London Tomorrow""is what I mean and instead  I say ""we will go to New York""
Or saying ""I go to school"" instead f ""college"" or repeating the same word twice in a sentence
Or instead of paper towel I would say lecture cards over and over again in a conversation (depsite the other person telling me the word). I would not be worried if I had this occasionally but this happens all the time. At least 3-4 times a day (not xouting incidences but conversations as a whole) on days I talk to people. 
Ot happens especially when I talk to more than one person or in a noisy environment.

I tried to write about it on Twitter and at the same time I didn't want to mention too much because my favorite Discord banned me for what I write on Twitter.  And then finally I just screeched feeling frustrated, and my dad came in and yelled at me extremely, extremely very loudly ""WHAT ARE YOU BITCHING ABOUT!?!?!?!? THERE'S NOTHING TO BITCH ABOUT!!!!!!""

I have been assigned through secondary school classroom assistants which i only feel helped the first few years but now it feels strange.. with so many people assuming I'm neurotypical it terrifies me when i have to explain why i have a classroom assistant, especially when i feel i don't need it. Does anyone else feel like this?

autism,xLordValx,2019/02/23,It’s frustrating when I can’t get social cues Hi so I am new to this subreddit and I do have autism. I try so dang hard to talk to others and for a lot of my life I was bullied so I am automatically on the defense with others. I’m really tired of explaining that I have special needs. It shouldn’t be explained. My words are aways twisted and I cannot understand others. It ends up making enemies because nobody gets me and thinks I am a massive jerk. Does anyone else have this or am I alone here....?,0.7016987179487162,3.004331413461543,3.1073076923076925,88.22102564102566,85.82692307692307,6.1589743589743575,21.166666666666664,7.492282038375204,0.8880089743589741,393,13,83,7,12,135,73,104,0.192,0.767,0.041,-0.9357,0,1,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,0,5,4,3,0,3,0,14,2,0,1,0,16,23,9,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,9,5,0,1,4,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,1,13,1,10,20,1,6,0,0,0,0,5,3,1,2,3,60,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.254740803756542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17198123535915988,0.2520155031110756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310878987910957,0.0,0.0,0.14993518111588372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21524160956406893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054683590033736,0.0,0.21784791558465832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2570083219132592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2203322130226399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17372910929713956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20910674230728385,0.0,0.0,0.16418048151041598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823765251531372,0.0,0.23755009364702315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15756853482748334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507256602960889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19769365824052576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15760149728674994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2826953054781998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16699097101060964,0.0,0.0,0.2560534578281973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,BoldBiBosmer,2019/02/23,"Advice for teaching Hey all! 
So I was diagnosed at age 24 with Autism and recently I've been asked to be a primary teacher at my church.
One of the kids has autism and we're trying to figure out a way to keep him occupied in class without distracting the other kids too much.
He seeks out stimulation so we are trying to think of things he can do/play with during class. The class itself only lasts 20mins.

I was wondering of anyone has any ideas?",2.9195786516853914,4.993003471910119,4.128525280898876,85.27795646067419,76.07865168539325,7.596067415730338,22.360955056179773,8.472884824447931,1.3924033707865169,355,10,70,7,8,116,65,89,0.0,0.974,0.026,0.2914,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,5,0,8,1,0,1,1,15,12,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,3,7,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,5,0,16,8,2,9,1,0,0,0,8,5,0,1,3,45,8,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2564167277056408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17844272714143325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18347795895595648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24531095560090396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663330572190736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29622053085948713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2332354365403647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2138930946280181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19289606124190667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17781075390375062,0.19956895796637214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2590908543488118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17432858957819913,0.16813695395423542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35630820375390543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082829244908628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2529466872195205,0.28456436411754205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Right now my energy levels have been at an all time low (so nice that depression and autism work well together /s) and while getting all my necessary vitamins would help... I have no energy to prepare large or complicated meals. Not to mention most vegetables are hell for me in one way or another. 

I'm fond of raw spinach, corn, potatoes, and very rarely peas. While I usually manage to remember to eat, I have horrible luck remembering to take medications/vitamins.

autism,Luhha,2019/02/23,"New boyfriend has Asperger’s Hi! For some back ground, my brother that is three years younger than I has autism. He has gotten much better with his social skills over the years and he is now considered very high functioning. So this would not be my first interaction with a person on the autism spectrum. 

I just started talking to K on February 4th. We meet on a dating app &amp; everything is going really great. We had our third date yesterday. He is sweet, funny, caring, and thoughtful. He has a 6 year old daughter, where I have a new daughter as well. We have a lot of the same interests &amp; seem to just really be on the same wave length of life! Things are going amazing! At the end of our third date, he mentions casually that he has high functioning Asperger’s syndrome. 

I’m just hear to ask others about their experiences with their own high functioning Asperger’s syndrome, or if a loved one has it. What should I expect? I know that everyone is different, but I would just like a general idea of what to expect. It absolutely does not make a difference to me, I think he’s such a great guy the way that he is. I would just like to be a little bit more knowledgeable about the subject before I bring it up again to ask him about his experiences?

autism,ohholeyheel89,2019/02/23,"Dressing with Autism In a relationship with a great guy with high functioning autism. Our relationship is great but a major disagreement we keep having is about his work attire. Now, I understand he has certain needs and has to wear comfortable clothing but the clothing he chooses to wear are borderline pajamas (i.e. flannel pajama button up shirts) with so many holes in them because they ""no longer make that style he likes."" I love him and I want him to be happy and comfortable but I also don't want him looking foolish at work if his clothes are all full of holes... His boss one time asked him if he had a ""rough morning"" after looking at his outfit. I want to cry, I don't want him to be disrespected because of what he wears. This is not meant to be a diss or a complaint and even if he didn't change his wardrobe idc but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for comfy clothes that are a bit more professional than pajamas? Please don't take this as me being disrespectful, I just want to make him comfortable and I don't want him being made fun of at work.",7.385362762237762,6.804063908653845,7.215314685314688,77.01150349650352,63.75961538461538,10.832867132867134,34.293706293706286,10.230975488527342,3.253763461538462,855,32,166,17,11,272,117,208,0.084,0.7090000000000001,0.206,0.9786,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,2,0,2,3,6,10,0,0,8,0,22,5,4,4,2,39,41,17,0,11,11,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,10,0,1,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,1,6,3,26,10,25,30,5,11,0,0,2,1,28,8,0,6,4,111,31,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11127293475265207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946222902706208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729230755833042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13008030542502536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1696410625784424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15190856595663155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14719527808412844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15284250227807705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919029100508842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30681220161776845,0.0,0.13777385205368015,0.0,0.1481207473684686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.147012652230129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12367705611350187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06797844174946119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2336908405716617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255823600992273,0.1316608589442584,0.18575861336066876,0.14106957837753584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10317307547862986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428717571539504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15273768026239953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29877589887055434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10461852775294964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113564136677345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14485319702681226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4924223300036827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508950927479555,0.3038941791378082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Was just wondering, are there any games in particular that you guys think appeal to you due to your autism?

autism,goblin722,2019/02/24,"Advice for caring for my autistic nephew? My twin niece and nephew are autistic. My nephew is severe; and although mostly a super happy kid, his meltdowns are scary. 

He's incredibly violent, either to others or himself. I know during meltdowns he can't control himself (my brother has aspergers and has had milder versions of these meltdowns. He explained them to me). 

I have bruises, scratches, and bite marks from trying to restrain him. (I'm in the process of attending a proper restraining course, but I can't let him hit himself or bang his head. Left unattended he's beaten himself up into a pulp). 

He's only 4.5 years old and is so strong, what are we going to do when he's older? 

I've been reading about Ross Greene and his methods. 

Are there any other things I can look into?

He's semi-verbal and uses AAC. 

I live with my sister and the twins to help support them all, as she's a single mother. 

We're in the process of moving to a bigger city that has a lot more supports, right now we kind of live in the middle of nowhere.

But I need some DIY solutions now.

He seems to be triggered over not getting something he wants (not sure if he is tantrumming or meltdowning. Or having a tantrum that turns into a meltdown) as well as changes in the routine. 

We have a hectic life, so thankfully he is okay with our picture daily schedule. We do one day at a time, we go over it every morning.

I worry about him as a teenager, the men in my family are big. I won't be able to restrain him then. My (and my sisters) biggest fear is having to institutionalize him. 

Do kids outgrow self injurious behaviours? Or escaping the house?(I swear he's related to Houdini) 

Anyone have any general advice for us? 
Anything is appreciated.

autism,mentalhygienist999,2019/02/24,"Am I on the spectrum? Hi all, 

I’m a 20 year old male who has never been diagnosed with autism, but I’ve also never been to a psychiatrist. 

Recently I’ve been looking back at my life and I feel like I may be on the spectrum. I see a lot of the signs in myself and it makes a lot of sense when I think about my childhood and the struggles I’ve had in school and social settings. 

My whole life I’ve struggled with making friends and fitting in, I have trouble with pronouncing certain letters and often get tongue tied. I think I have social anxiety, I can’t look people in the eye and I get panic attacks whenever I walk into class or have a presentation or really at any kind of public event. I tend to speak in short sentences and it’s hard for me to converse at all outside of simple phrases and short answers. I’ve had a lot of struggles in school, I can never seem to focus on my schoolwork or find any motivation to get started on essays.

My question is, do I sound like someone that might be on the spectrum? I can answer any further questions for clarification if I didn’t provide enough information.

Also, at this point in my life would it be worth it to seek out a diagnosis?",5.5515720263000645,5.4934161506276205,6.57078601315003,78.35938284518829,67.41004184100419,8.83693962940825,32.97101016138673,8.418075326091056,2.5092591751344884,936,38,183,12,14,314,131,239,0.108,0.8079999999999999,0.084,-0.7643,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,1,6,11,1,4,13,0,22,5,1,3,6,47,37,17,0,2,5,0,2,2,1,3,4,2,0,1,7,14,0,0,12,0,1,1,5,6,0,0,6,8,24,5,35,25,7,37,0,0,4,0,13,23,0,13,14,130,31,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838273927285535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344797809968523,0.0,0.08792516932138343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13075546573345845,0.0,0.0883781304744051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11665688281680993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1187588612360365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0581147274923355,0.08210978205991172,0.0,0.0,0.10504875737528073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08879870687926407,0.0,0.18014680923158727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10295942909936624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11968740020581678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24354654726774244,0.11230313765275672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19303336441303293,0.0,0.0,0.2931415771679379,0.0,0.0,0.15344037454781567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12192816167679765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26593550442313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12060523491289395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13485177878189894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07968164665938983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865098343244003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2575076200651769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07363047902666102,0.0,0.11348471628069436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23264126493482484,0.0915885319319362,0.1046327559532284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343240735479239,0.09738428390922337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135177786097515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36046590766747655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14729176422497745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12832112782859967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08164672034831781,0.0,0.0,0.07401454756834522
autism,Gwendalenia,2019/02/24,"Son chewing clothes My 5yr old son is chewing his clothes like crazy. He soaks 3-4 shirts a day.  We have used bandanas but he takes them off. I bought some terry cloth necklaces but he takes them off.  He doesn’t like anything plastic or silicone just like cloth.  He is also back to his pica tendencies, chewing shoes, anything.  
I don’t know why he has started this and we can’t get him to stop.

Any suggestions or if there is anyone who has gone through this what helped you to stop?  Is this a sensory tic or anxiety issue?",1.9561188811188792,4.363028038461542,2.6203496503496524,93.11555944055945,81.11538461538461,5.7048951048951055,25.8006993006993,6.980632752743323,1.083588461538462,412,17,85,5,11,128,70,104,0.091,0.8320000000000001,0.077,-0.1179,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,2,1,2,0,4,3,0,0,2,0,10,5,2,1,0,15,18,8,0,1,7,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,3,2,1,0,1,1,3,0,0,0,2,0,11,3,6,16,1,9,0,0,0,0,19,2,0,5,9,46,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865667068563528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15864926300575424,0.0,0.17847078225496416,0.0,0.0,0.16312597006596455,0.0,0.3839654185083713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793902042126905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15045660372921485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12188751795965383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563733743210704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2435003856197681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12821336659943466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3419298873337509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2448048810718995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16512809181647264,0.0,0.0,0.39009176267145057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3508190781956987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20149281729739926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21051333049806292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,wk8481,2019/02/24,"I have created a petition about Emotional Intelligence (EQ) how its is important and will improve all including Aspies, Parents, Educators, Counselor, Therapists etc http://chng.it/jJ9MVwvnct (My link)

To introduce myself I have created an NGO/NPO at the age of 17 where I want to express my love from EQ and how it has helped boost my daily life. 
Because our world and being and aspie or being a human being is tough so we need to different phenomenons in how to improve our life overall.

I have listed a company which has inspired me to start EQ and they will help you and me improve our EQ because we need a strong EQ to be able to be comfortable, love, accept, respect our body and be able to speak freely and openly about anything in front of a wide audience.

This will help speed up or help the process for many people in the world who have emotional stress, anxiety, etc and can help people on this subreddit to be able to have an idea of how to help themselves or their children. But this isn't a quick help to getting better overall no.

This is a day by day practice and needs to be apart of your life if you want it to work. Either be serious about it or don't because it's up to you.

To give an example, before I was referred to EQ or Mygrow and before I used to be extremely skeptical and hated myself with a passion and had blocked people off and was a lot of times nervous but because I knew somewhere deep down that I need help with my emotional state because we need to EQ to work with IQ to balance our lives because if you just have IQ you can't express everything that you want, you can try but you won't be able to relate or people won't be able to relate to you.

So I'm giving this source of betterment to those who need it which is every life form in this planet and if you don't take part in it that's okay since this is your life not mine and you are in charge of it but if you do then good luck and may your journey to one of many truths be enlightening and educational. 

Also look into r/emotionalintelligence

autism,barn1231,2019/02/24,"Advertising Yourself as Parent of Autistic Child So, this may seem weird, but wondering if others have had this thought/idea.  I am a parent of 4 year old boy with Autism, and my family just returned from ski vacation in Canada.  While in a pool at our hotel, I noticed another family with a child I believed to be with autism.  Our son is newly diagnosed,  and I would have welcomed learning from this family (and them from me) about challenges of vacationing with a child with autism, etc.  Having an instant support group would be nice, especially when surrounding by neurotypical families.  Now of course you can't approach a family on the assumption that they have a autistic child.  So my idea would be to have a parent bracelet that would signal that I'm a parent of an autistic child and am open to being approached as a parent of an autistic child.  The bracelet would not need to be very obvious (doesn't need to say autism), but perhaps would have a symbol and be a secret handshake kind of thing.   What do you think?  (To be clear, I'm not thinking of this as a commercial venture, but rather of a solution to bringing autistic families together in a inoffensive way).  Thanks!",7.919296636085626,7.870080761467893,7.733532110091745,71.97381498470948,62.48623853211009,11.11987767584098,36.97400611620795,10.686352973137794,4.035769418960244,938,41,162,21,12,300,117,218,0.006,0.887,0.106,0.968,5,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,2,2,2,1,7,7,0,0,19,0,27,1,0,0,2,37,38,16,0,10,8,6,0,0,0,7,1,1,0,7,10,11,0,0,7,3,0,3,4,1,0,0,1,1,13,6,34,23,1,17,0,0,0,0,23,7,0,4,6,122,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10203232908368652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10962893285570707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09876209349615853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085203203580364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5503805500504936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21969003825283498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10132773929851406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14430021608926472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11078190145500554,0.10210478112378486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5402260662836622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07738050208383541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858242888626558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11042007649264288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08958497766945463,0.0,0.0,0.0646448347146542,0.12469768296864868,0.0,0.07724896205017827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08028646340322364,0.0,0.07723584100677215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10552265883965864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41473426174216255,0.0,0.0,0.06266095484909921

autism,Brisivad,2019/02/24,"Private neurotypical school or private ASD school? Hey all,

I am hoping to get some feedback from people on the spectrum. My son is high functioning and will be starting kindergarten this next year at a private school (around neurotypical kids) with an ABA shadow. We are fortunate and live in an area that has a private school for kids with HFA, but we have chosen to send him to a school around neurotypical kids. He is still very delayed in language at the age of 6, but we are hoping that being around neurotypical kids he will start to close the gap a little with his language. Our concerns about the HFA school are that the kids all have some of the same challenges language delay/social skill delays. Academics are no problem for him right now. Can you all please tell me if being around neurotypical kids has helped you make progress or had the opposite effect?",9.184103773584905,8.52270391194969,7.597727987421383,75.99017688679247,60.19496855345912,9.962578616352204,35.59827044025157,8.841846274778883,2.9313704402515715,698,25,123,8,8,208,95,159,0.054000000000000006,0.851,0.095,0.7069,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,4,2,0,4,7,4,0,0,13,0,18,0,0,2,3,31,24,7,0,4,5,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,4,13,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,12,3,22,18,6,24,0,0,0,0,22,14,0,7,9,85,16,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4365615510889049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06405367173099433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08217649316269816,0.12953410009038746,0.0,0.2435398076005111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287785296488757,0.10825843800647976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183674823458878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13038696283714224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499571088507589,0.0,0.0,0.13457847105372162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173120671507229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10470010911501412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7444691666148655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17355445026420113,0.0,0.09790887277621413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071581917014609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10115820587985974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895066618414863

I'll always be lonely and depressed and honestly I'm fine with being lonely and depressed for the rest of my life.",2.137259358288773,3.5096748382352985,4.242112299465242,86.66973262032086,76.35294117647058,6.12192513368984,22.657754010695186,6.574015621080383,0.6199205882352943,502,14,103,4,11,173,83,136,0.16699999999999998,0.703,0.13,-0.7505,0,4,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,1,0,1,14,0,0,8,0,15,2,0,1,3,19,24,5,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,4,2,0,0,5,4,8,0,0,4,1,0,2,3,4,0,1,3,2,17,10,13,13,3,16,0,4,1,0,9,8,0,1,7,68,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835998339074037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15170653420663474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.207768248202068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17401397767040616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14679845294953706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29355841935922505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16283996696325825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08616754313054849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09685144468472118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16873881508498415,0.0,0.18141119688458374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2407399813154889,0.08325673951294085,0.17080178643821314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39430640108131604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33394335533491626,0.0,0.0,0.17882311815877158,0.0,0.1154784167733552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17521622006308527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724702764274398,0.1357996348954672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409700285462475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14439307979362515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091958096878643,0.0,0.0,0.0993710474180204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902635836705896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12105876772818665,0.0,0.0,0.10974243526693886
autism,Miss_Robot_,2019/02/24,"27 going on 15 Years ago I spoke with my therapist about a kind of delayed/arrested development. She said it was common in individuals who have ADHD. I wonder if people on the spectrum experience this as well. I was diagnosed with ADHD at age five and ASD at age 24 (I am 27 now). I often feel as though I am going through my adolescence now, but stuck at other ages as well (11, 5 and 13. Ages that coincide with incredibly traumatic times in my life, though I most of it has been riddled with trauma and stressful events to be honest). I am wise, bright, emotionally mature and yet somehow emotionally and mentally underdeveloped. I'd love to hear from others and learn how common this phenomenon might be. This is not about the inner child or criticism whatsoever of acting and living ones life in ways society ascribes to children. I strongly oppose society putting expectations, ideals and a mold adults are supposed to meet, vest in and force themselves into. Doing and being, what you did and who you were that makes brought happiness, wonder, growth and honor to the self is I believe fundamental to a health adulthood. By not doing this, I think we end up unhappy, unfulfilled and develop problems/complications. Anyway many thanks in advance.",5.753333333333334,7.964884711111113,6.591666666666669,70.06750000000002,68.55555555555556,9.622222222222225,31.61111111111111,9.994966539143718,3.6043777777777777,1000,43,160,26,18,330,149,225,0.106,0.7290000000000001,0.166,0.9394,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,1,2,0,4,13,14,0,1,6,0,19,5,0,2,0,38,33,22,0,3,5,0,1,0,0,1,4,3,0,4,13,19,0,1,5,0,0,7,2,2,2,2,9,5,18,12,33,20,1,35,0,0,1,1,15,13,0,8,14,121,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33964772335369986,0.0,0.1252603565452712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15920488822888465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14342389045236467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31790328736321005,0.12515628669347695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382256112074198,0.0,0.0,0.07144919449475205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16061634014311524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15042420172169385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15020300541459086,0.1592635475290715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471497622870977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19961898787822446,0.0,0.0,0.12477689600980048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1275353156385297,0.0,0.09432369071902104,0.14326337863978428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424044783326652,0.1499046681270601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09575345379738892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979646591404856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420528217117114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13441555959205612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14741428608511753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16186698444107922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13009673619303294,0.0,0.1640686155939043,0.0,0.09054398397526278,0.27766732333438715,0.0,0.08239739739777091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11216312258490567,0.0,0.0,0.2541043871155441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30648338296413546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09099723999134686
autism,sara3d,2019/02/25,"Refusing to poop My 4 y old son on the spectrum recently is refusing to poop. It seems that he is scared of the proccess. He is verbal and says that he doesnt need to poop even after 4 days. Last time he was holding it so much and he went urgently to bathroom because it was the maximum of 4 days. Yesterday i needed to put suppositorium (glycerin) in his rectum and he did it in few seconds. Yesterday it was after 5 days. I have tried everything like rewarding him after or even tell him that otherwise we go to doctor. He is scared he says I am gonna poop now and then stays for 40-50 min in the bathroom and nothing. This happened the last 3 weeks. No problems before with this. But As I see he is scared of doing it.  Any tips or idea how to manage this? How long did it last if it were your case?

autism,Chuck_man,2019/02/25,"Toilet Training 4yo with Autism Hey r/Autism
(Excuse formatting posting from mobile)
I'm  a parent with a 4yo with Autism that is in the habbit of taking off his nappy and pooing on his bed, we've tried toilet training him with by sitting him on the toilet and basically flushing his system with lots of water to get him to urinate. He seems to understand that the toilet is the place to go.

Whenever we've sat him on the toilet he has done a poo and we've celebrated and he seems like he gets it but evidently he is still missing the mark.

Has anyone gone through this before? Got any tips or pointers? I currently am working away and its just my wife dealing with our 3 kids so she can't monitor him constantly as is probably ideal

Thanks all!",3.2560910518053348,5.342031741496601,4.633605442176876,81.98218210361071,75.12244897959185,7.244165358451076,25.59340659340659,8.139509932561175,1.7378910518053383,594,21,110,10,13,197,96,147,0.019,0.8909999999999999,0.09,0.8859999999999999,2,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,0,2,3,4,0,0,9,0,9,2,1,0,1,20,22,9,0,1,3,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,11,1,0,3,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,4,0,12,3,22,18,2,15,0,1,0,0,21,7,0,4,4,69,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14947904904730394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536969943534811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20651971362735735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870430104543302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23753765162048865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2266155367454061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22494301701175465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296843985299119,0.0,0.12492368309410767,0.0,0.17580297375483195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10738857408085796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868754909485285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2440741539041995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.229655758866304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105182208593139,0.0,0.23699348539092896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4002154418413715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17554138542431774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16527055090839846,0.0,0.0,0.20237247878111145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492372715831466,0.0,0.0,0.22883105113079816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600250595591246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,NEONVORE,2019/02/25,"Does this sound like Autism? I really hope this doesn’t sound insensitive! Or annoying or weird but I’m genuinely confused. 

I’ve suffered from depression, anxiety and bulimia all my life? And it really doesn’t have much to do with this but I thought it could have some input (?)

I have these weird moments where I stop what I’m doing, tense up and start spazzing my hands about? Sometimes it’s my legs too, where I start kicking and moving in any direction. I also sometimes /have/ to kick or punch something, I can’t control it. It’s never someone or something, it’s usually my face or arm or a wall.

I’m never sad, mad or even excited when it happens, I’m just maybe doing work, drawing or perhaps laying in bed. It just happens.

I hope I don’t sound obnoxious but? I’m genuinely just so confused. It calms me down after too. I crossposted this from another I posted because my friends kept telling me it’s Tourette’s but?..",1.9537227045514352,4.578189939226527,3.3526440410418306,86.37727440147331,83.30939226519338,6.762536174690871,27.40357800578795,7.957251820313856,2.094834043672718,733,34,139,15,21,239,99,181,0.18,0.69,0.13,-0.8247,0,0,2,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,2,12,15,2,2,1,0,12,5,4,1,3,33,25,19,0,3,15,0,1,1,1,0,1,3,1,0,16,5,0,3,1,0,0,1,6,9,0,0,2,4,18,6,11,22,3,18,0,3,0,0,2,7,0,13,10,90,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13353393638375227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11355220312620422,0.17509320819831906,0.12773932973122734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10178952729509974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18728239582183745,0.13332003328039452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14381972702109327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14612542252394678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11028879009523908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12900842142590307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2953199256962113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331697858857362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794299230603444,0.08157804893182086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16775396759567854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17747343474118749,0.12274959635101765,0.0,0.2575707149532881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15992079110176202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21394347287011592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414817082404455,0.2570988984612239,0.3302952037104621,0.0,0.236378767458964,0.0,0.0,0.13960285170414244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459479790864659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13256355820577345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18390500417321345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12156351130244485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There's supposedly more information coming in the mail on next steps for treatment, but right now it's just my wife and me raising our wonderful son like we always have, with no answers about what's next.  

When I'm alone my facade breaks and I'm overwhelmed. The internet searches I've conducted have been unsatisfying. The posts of accomoplishments and love on this sub are what I've needed.

I received this email from Dr. Sulak about this study.  I can't vouch for it but if you are already treating your child with cannabis and can help extend our knowledge of how cannabis is helping people with autism that would be great!

&amp;#x200B;

**Cannabis &amp; Autism Study**

My colleagues at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia are conducting a study on cannabis and autism, and we need your help.  If you have a child with an autistic spectrum disorder who’s using cannabis products, please contact Mary Ann Diliberto, RN and complete the survey.  Clinically, I’ve observed several patients with autism respond beautifully to cannabis, and recent data suggests that children with autism may have impaired function in their endocannabinoid system, indicating that cannabinoid therapies may be very appropriate.I know firsthand that parents have limited time, but I also know that we have to work together to move the science forward.  With your help we can better understand how to use cannabis to help the increasing number of children with autistic spectrum disorders.Thanks for your help gathering important scientific data!

**WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THIS OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH STUDY?**

The purpose of this research study is to understand the use of cannabis in children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Information provided will help us to inform future research and develop treatment guidelines for this population.

**WHO CAN BE A PART OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY?**

Children under the age of 18 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder who are currently being treated with cannabis obtained legally. 

**WHAT WILL PARTICIPANTS BE ASKED TO DO?**

Participants are asked to join a confidential registry and provide information on the type of cannabis their child is being treated with. Parents will be asked to complete questionnaires and provide medical background information.

**WHAT WILL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?**

We will provide educational workshops for parents and caregivers to share what we have learned from this observational research study.

**I WANT TO HELP.  WHO DO I CALL?**

autism,TheGrimVeeper,2019/02/25,"Educational apps? I was recently hired as an educational aid for a child in middle school with autism. His teachers don't seem to have a lot of activities for him, so I'm struggling with keeping him busy.

I have an android tablet and all the rooms have android smart boards. I'm hoping you guys might have apps that have worked  well I can fall back on when there is nothing else.

We are currently working on sight words and learning money.

Any ideas? Other easy to put together activities would be good too.

autism,c-monkeyyyy,2019/02/25,"""Germaphobia"" &amp; ASD Hi, I always had a lot of germaphobic tendencies, especially when I was younger. As a kid I hated touching doorknobs, public transport, old food, and \*worst of all\* carts and other supermarket items. I wonder if it could have something to do with ASD?  My parents thought I was weird because I said I could ""feel"" the germs crawling around lol, but I wonder if it actually was sensitivity to touch? Has anyone ever had similar experiences or other comments?",8.333214285714284,9.10737255952381,8.802476190476193,61.87585714285717,61.5,11.005714285714284,40.609523809523814,10.793553405168565,4.915269523809523,381,20,56,9,5,127,64,84,0.058,0.917,0.025,-0.3798,1,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,0,3,3,1,0,3,1,10,1,0,0,2,17,16,8,0,4,4,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,4,4,1,0,4,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,7,4,9,0,7,7,4,5,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,6,3,45,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.21105838989919148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799625490174345,0.23433963235130464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15122822592557658,0.0,0.0,0.19253533559783848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318424733758458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34536446735387244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19563792837615385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21156365028140228,0.0,0.0,0.1093578264182362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26152701697199826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21353203569517248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18387379066191234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2269498096928066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24015369620259736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20573210849644816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16650315398883386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717024123973258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4690935542559197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,delaneytheeditor,2019/02/26,"Nephew recently diagnosed with Autism. How can I help my family? My nephew (3yrs) was recently diagnosed with autism and needs 40hrs/week of behavior or speech therapy (I can't remember which).

I'm wondering if anyone could help me out with:

*  Recommended reading material about autism
* Tips to better interact with my nephew (ex: someone told me to get eye level with him when trying to play or talk to him)
*  How to help his sister (5yrs) understand what's going on with her brother &amp; possibly help her interact with him better

autism,wetalkedaboutthis,2019/02/26,"I'm confused and need help I have several friends on the spectrum, and I fucking love them. They're excellent. And talking to them about random stuff my life, has kinda made me think that I might be autistic too. Honestly, I feel like something small has been wrong with me my whole life and I couldn't figure out what but I would always get in trouble for little things other people wouldn't. It's continued into my adult life and I've just adapted as best I could and hoped for the best. Recently, I kind of had moment that brought me to the thought that I might be autistic and immediately went to see my mental health provider. He said that with what's he seen of me before and what he heard from what I  was telling him, he doesn't think I am. I hate to be one of those people who questions a medical professional but I legitimately feel like he maybe wasn't thorough enough or maybe had blinders on because military or I don't know. I don't even know why I'm posting this here, no one here can fix it for me, I guess I just needed a place to say this stuff because it doesn't sound OK to say to people out loud. I don't know.

autism,Jsgoose6,2019/02/26,"Does anyone else feel ready to cut ties, quit a job, or walk out of somewhere after a negative social interaction? Probably my most frequent example: i work with some people who tend to get mean for no reason. It’ll go from jokes to purposely striking nerves. Pointing out I’m “too much of an ‘autist’ to think a show is funny”, or saying I blurt things out too much, etc. And not just saying it once, but just repeating it over and over. And they “warn” the new guys in front of me that I’m a mess or a joke. Instead of sticking up for myself and then moving on, I can’t handle it. I feel like I’m gonna have a meltdown as soon as it starts, and I shut down. I want to quit my job and walk out. Once I ran to the bathroom and started hitting my head over and over cause I got so overwhelmed. I’ve never been one who can’t take a joke or criticism, but for some reason when people get a little too much I just can’t handle it. Does anyone else feel overwhelmed like this during something minor?

autism,Shadowadha,2019/02/26,"Friendhips, how? I struggle so much with friendships, when they become real and close. I just don't know what to do. People usually don't come close, they think I rather be alone because I always am. Or that I'm arrogant because I don't say much, and I'm just weird and I don't understand things. I can do sortoff okay with people, as long as I don't let them come close.

But sometimes I manage to make a friend. And then I become so afraid of losing that friend that I cling on. It's like when I realize I actually care for someone I get so scared. 

I don't know what to do anymore and I become so afraid of losing that person that I actually try to push the friendship away. I kinda go from pushing someone away to trying to get confirmation all the time. And that is like I constantly want to ask if we are okay and why we are friends, and when confirmed I want to ask the exact same question again, to get the same answer. Preferably a couple of times in a row. And it is crazy and it doesn't make any sense but doing that calmes me down and helps me get rid of the nerves a friendship can give me. It's very heavy to people though if I go through that. It does becomes too much at some point. So I avoid it and then the only option I have left is pushing someone away.

It's like I don't understand friendships, like I can't grab hold of the concept and I constantly want to ask in attempt to understand it and fear of losing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there more with these problems? It makes me feel so alone.",3.002301075268818,4.34683797741936,3.8739516129032254,90.29426075268816,74.06451612903227,6.586021505376344,24.85215053763441,6.996647511020387,0.8294731182795698,1183,37,255,11,24,379,141,310,0.11,0.759,0.131,0.5224,0,3,0,0,0,0,32.0,2,0,3,4,20,22,0,6,11,2,25,0,0,4,2,61,53,34,0,8,8,0,2,4,3,0,0,1,0,1,22,24,0,2,11,0,0,7,9,11,0,0,0,3,35,11,34,51,8,32,0,3,0,0,16,13,0,7,16,173,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.1622201230284981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1721679917618419,0.0,0.0,0.06915988238153943,0.09005707853793134,0.10099607739525428,0.056522312145248436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08242958679230898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331091206782613,0.0,0.2342730662027185,0.0,0.0,0.10133452767088087,0.3671841483038473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08474317394037889,0.0,0.0,0.14319562321177912,0.0,0.17963958664058274,0.0,0.0,0.09196722003941857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07273612062881099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09352957064106958,0.04202637967665878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19264762984201206,0.0,0.17370050654380284,0.07973326177729634,0.09447444916437413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055711476417389605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09135770051277917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09030670702783716,0.08499261639900528,0.0,0.16242678940539773,0.0,0.0,0.07355580185174572,0.0,0.27895950352951426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664434399866807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18330135769213568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.063214114228016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17286828727935807,0.07257443252159514,0.0,0.0,0.07857229447692593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07953160582799608,0.0,0.0,0.09310990068669946,0.0,0.0,0.09460517850060464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06609785980176783,0.08321447251267505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21127392659537064,0.0,0.08220469568279534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08689178429066736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05521914573839735,0.05325792508775164,0.08166188882024167,0.0,0.09693221405488632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128617783146108,0.0,0.0,0.2595827344964013,0.0,0.0,0.09154147400732214,0.06858011073973905,0.14707342511028024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07500003436332253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10099607739525428,0.0
autism,Nickftw22,2019/02/26,"Query of relationships with a NT Hello everyone!

I am new to this sub, have had my diagnosis of high functioning autism for about 4 years now, and am currently 28 years old. About 4 months ago I started a relationship with a wonderful woman, J, and it’s been good except for a few bumps. When we encounter conflict I find us usually coming to a stop when I try to look at everything rationally.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if it is viable to use ""eristical"" while being in a dialogue with someone else.

I think that I would like to know if people know what it means.

If not, then could you tell me a simple synonym for it?

Thank you in advance.

autism,lightningstormm,2019/02/27,"Autism Scientific Research &amp; Treatment I am interested in the research surrounding Autism and autoimmune disorders. I've learned quite a bit of new information over the last few weeks researching. Here are some interesting things I've been putting together:

1. ASD may be a blend of neurological damage through autoimmune or physical factors
2. A mother's nutrition does have an impact
3. The father's nutrition does have an impact
4. Low Vitamin D correlates with higher rates of ASD
5. MTHFR genetic mutations correlates with higher rates of ASD
6. Abnormal gut microbiome correlates with higher rates of ASD
7. Some babies experience direct triggers from vaccinations that tip them over the edge or invoke ASD
8. Mercury may cause ASD, but safe levels may be different depending on genetics
9. Autoimmune disorders have increased significantly over the last 30 years alongside ASD
10. Glysophate, herbicides, insecticides, pesticides correlate with ASD,  potential impact on gut?
11. Breast feeding for longer periods may reduce the risk of ASD or symptoms
12. Low IGF is correlated with ASD
13. Chelation therapy may help ASD
14. Candida / Fungal overgrowth may impact ASD
15. Gut therapy may help ASD
16. The brain develops 80% by age 3, and 90% by age 5. ASD treatment is the most important during this time  


I'll keep adding more as I go through my notes",6.255830721003138,9.37348627586207,6.7822100313479625,65.22015673981193,69.86206896551724,11.459561128526644,36.40752351097178,11.022393298168332,5.504450000000001,1104,60,159,42,22,359,149,232,0.037000000000000005,0.873,0.09,0.9116,1,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,1,1,1,7,0,1,13,0,17,9,5,3,0,28,19,7,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,7,3,0,0,0,3,7,1,2,2,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,1,0,4,3,24,9,7,22,0,3,0,1,6,10,0,14,9,73,7,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19205838387007249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935192370579522,0.0,0.0,0.1978779479396704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18209223925111573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1851963183896342,0.4063048120892165,0.0,0.3102383955540863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733918089356135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10073949942692534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376238780438077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575545749506405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28897697630233204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17119635944470735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17819270615516494,0.0,0.18853512777916592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842383716259928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40541870733848906,0.0,0.11776198008395004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10336025040212808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421852424197601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114147992636265

I have found that my productivity and ability have only increased since starting very moderate use (one time per week) and I am in a very judgment driven field- where I have to make snap decisions a lot.",9.168749999999996,8.87252754166667,9.22925,63.09075000000003,60.04166666666666,12.68,37.95,11.979248473330829,4.9036775000000015,428,18,67,12,5,141,72,96,0.044,0.772,0.185,0.9397,0,0,3,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,4,0,6,5,0,3,1,20,15,7,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,6,5,4,0,4,2,0,2,3,0,0,1,4,0,6,3,8,11,3,11,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,4,4,44,12,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19165080761899014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253927363485868,0.1837462876189328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17567657240353396,0.20796757597015644,0.0,0.14980843529052235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1754205926725339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16390571845520066,0.0,0.0,0.3932554101873775,0.0,0.0,0.09369329357868693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14342776207215974,0.3954271665611473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894735483578388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15246120631760304,0.0,0.0,0.11970515148717435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13831148825334635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215196479787995,0.13638966703159472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243258641960288,0.1565853260384752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14834484852804056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269317403753381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456962468772496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3097696302469785,0.0,0.2959344944720415,0.0,0.0,0.1438488914076913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Kwyjibo68,2019/02/27,"Need help with school work I hope someone can give me some insight or advice.


My 9yo son is in 4th grade. He is in a mainstream classroom. Early on in school, he had some behavior issues that mostly resolved once he became accustomed to how school works. He's a smart kid, has a great memory, likes to read. 


As he's gotten older, the schoolwork has gotten more difficult, as it does. He seems to be more and more intimidated by the work. He can't seem to learn or retain any information he's learning in school. He knows all about his interests (Minecraft, etc) in great detail, so he obviously has the ability to learn. I assumed when he was younger that learning things like the multiplication tables would be a breeze for him because his memorization is so good, but this was not the case. 


I think that he would likely do better with some other academic approach, but I'm not sure what that it is. I'm doing all I can to research different teaching techniques and we do all we try to reinforce at home what he's learning at school, but honestly that is no fun for any of us. I am not a good teacher. 


I want to help and I feel like I'm failing him. I hope someone can offer me some insights or suggestions.

autism,badwolfgoddess,2019/02/27,"Got a metaphorical bomb of a diagnosis tossed into my lap and its been a few weeks but i'm still figuring out how to cope. I'm 31, nearly 32 years old.  I always knew I was odd but I attributed that to the fact that I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and my whole family is kinda ""weirdos"".  My mother and I were in the car a couple weeks back and having a conversation about Autism in relation to a comic convention I was hoping to attend. The convention was supporting a cause to ""eradicate Autism "" which didn't sit well with me. I'd consulted a friend with much more insight into the Autism community and was merely discussing the topic with my mom.

She dropped the bomb at that point.  She revealed that on 2 separate occasions once as a young child and once as a young teenager I had been diagnosed with Autism and my parents had chosen deliberately to keep that from me  For a multitude of reasons ranging from not having a lot of understaning on it at that time in history, to having enormous feelings of guilt and failure because I was an anxious, hyperactive child already, to not wanting me to use it as an excuse to hold me back. 

 Ultimately this was something that happened so long ago that I didn't feel it was right to be angry although I expressed that I was extremely disappointed because I felt like it was something I had a right to know, especially as an adult. 

 I'm still reeling about what it all means for me and my life and definitely agree that it explains quite a lot but i'm not sure how to even begin to go about finding ways to deal.  I have a therapist so i'm planning to talk to him about it but how do I fit this diagnosis into the narrative structure of my life?  For one thing I just found out i'm not alone in the struggle to keep a job which is kind of a relief but I have no idea how to fix that. Can it even be fixed? And I've noticed how utterly rude people are about Autistic people, there's a lot of prejudice I think.  I am afraid to acknowledge myself as Autistic because I don't want people to look at me differently or treat me badly.

autism,Randommyman,2019/02/27,"Has this caused me to isolate myself emotionally? I was diagnosed with Aspergers when I was 16. When I was 13 my half brother in his 20s pushed me onto a bed and punched me 6 times as hard as he could all over my body. Had bruises all over my body, told my mum but she didn't do anything. Around that time he also forcibly held me and pushed his finger through my boxers into my rear so it went inside. When I was like 6-7 he'd lay behind me and rub my nipples until they were erect.                                      After the stuff when I was 13, I stopped brushing my teeth for a year and began just eating junk food, lost a tooth. Also stopped washing properly and my hair went completely black from dirt I guess. I looked up to him and thought he was cool, he moulded my interests and the films and music I liked. Does this explain why for the next 7 years I shut myself off socially, refusing to be involved in friendships and basically isolating myself from reality? I've rarely left the house or spoken to people since. Stopped going to school when I was 14. Also, i'm gay and had very little self esteem at the time it happened. I was so confused by everything and became disturbed and even more alienated. Does what my brother did explain why I alienated myself? Is it how an aspergers person would react? He would also push me over and drag me about the room and accuse me of faking autism. I remember visiting him once, cos he lives in a diff country and only ever visited us, and he pushed me about his flat. I hid in the bathroom, phoned my mum, but she never told him to stop. I gave up on friendships after this and completely shut myself off. I've wondering for years since why am i so bitter and angry and upset. Just thought it was how I was.",3.5696069538926696,5.149578209912541,4.570275348234535,84.92266493899147,73.02332361516034,7.4138429975164675,26.406327610409235,8.045849151850463,1.6091175682971603,1358,47,267,20,27,442,187,343,0.149,0.7979999999999999,0.053,-0.9856,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,1,0,1,1,25,10,1,3,12,1,24,11,6,5,4,53,42,39,0,3,5,4,4,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,10,22,2,6,6,1,0,9,2,6,0,1,25,9,55,4,39,12,3,52,0,1,2,1,35,21,0,4,24,184,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3259213609466011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08384570180374762,0.09070252646721597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22635070767589746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10466774044160326,0.0,0.0,0.21365668402100527,0.0,0.0,0.08134981987522563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341486501847433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1783269402058033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042575557315876,0.0,0.1146110506691167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06729651191756526,0.09216414390340416,0.0,0.0,0.09157097537290937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232041957656162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05790568462225034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11224186757199436,0.0,0.09009982284667158,0.0,0.09127224391389152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11756585638186733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070234846947023,0.0,0.0,0.09955532447878383,0.10211922404053088,0.08996957074291229,0.0,0.08556082951480692,0.0,0.11122352970178516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858283091827124,0.0,0.10835976661909348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10850811844979998,0.0,0.07749093208881591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063678142909513,0.08896526496645635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11542001193594008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10311678329662716,0.0,0.0,0.10629211388147672,0.0,0.0,0.16856673724922527,0.0,0.0,0.103862677672396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3407339935571374,0.0,0.0,0.11663816144874913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16177646099709625,0.1782363252639737,0.0,0.0,0.19471799933531864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1225595362942956,0.0,0.0,0.08406883128675274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889036534712447,0.2758160566108826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1104939267080064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14475758926769,0.0,0.0,0.19683890726456785
autism,rkim777,2019/02/27,"[SC] How best to help our community? I hope this is the proper sub to post this in and apologize in advance if not. I belong to a relatively new, local group that wants to help intellectual and developmentally disabled (I/DD) people. We want to especially help children. Our founder and president is intent on starting an after-school program for I/DD kids. But I'm not so sure there is much interest in this from people with I/DD kids. Our president says that there is no after-school program for I/DD kids even though we live in an areas with parents who have I/DD kids. Maybe the reason there is no such program is that there is no interest in it? Also, I volunteer to help another organization with ongoing programs to help I/DD kids but the attendance there is always low.

Our president wants us to raise funds and get grants for this after-school program but, given how low attendance is at the other place where I help, I'm a bit concerned that we may be ""aiming at the wrong target"" by expending a lot of time and resources on an after-school program that may not even be wanted. Are there other things, besides an after-school program, for which we can raise funds and apply for grant money to help I/DD people?

autism,UnusualOddDuck,2019/02/27,"Recently Diagnosed and Feeling Lost Hello all!
I’m being set up with a behavioral counselor and psychologist to figure where I am at on the spectrum. I’ve always known Inwas different from other kids growing up but as a girl I was able to play it off as shy. Now as an adult I’m labeled as eccentric but after going to the doctor and being screened I’m not sure what to do. I’m 28 years old and have been pretending to be normal for years, mimicking regular women, copy their voices, style, and attitudes but I’m so exhausted. Will counseling help? Or just tell me to keep on doing what I already am doing?",2.943045454545451,5.104430183333335,4.987878787878788,78.73227272727277,76.33333333333334,8.363636363636363,26.74242424242424,9.095868883498916,2.5668333333333324,482,19,87,12,11,166,85,120,0.095,0.8170000000000001,0.08900000000000001,-0.4131,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,1,1,4,4,0,0,5,0,12,3,0,0,2,19,21,14,0,1,6,0,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,4,4,6,0,1,3,2,0,2,1,2,0,0,3,3,5,2,20,14,1,16,0,1,1,0,8,7,0,1,6,61,9,1,0.2545251087504625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2808747866739068,0.0,0.21178528006173072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583376276702704,0.0,0.2659245657363161,0.0,0.2605172339584152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869554260805974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14465248483632073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17060281523640633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2262336113797392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778442228700879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24938056577794404,0.0,0.0,0.2670812859018301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513128387531691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398869028163772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2224661636961912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3278116502036251
autism,professor_aloof,2019/02/27,"Looking for practical dating advice for a ""very late male bloomer"" Hey all,

Nine months ago, I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/8hxu5r/looking_for_existing_literature_on_dating_and/) asking for literature on dating and sexual intimacy on the autism spectrum. There was some good material in there, and I really appreciate it! I read the texts and watched the videos and I found them really useful.

I think I now feel confident enough to take the next step, which is to actually get to know people and date. Now, this is where things get tricky. There's an appreciable gap between my chronological age (~30 years) and my romantic experience (which comes from a 3-month relationship that occurred around 10 years ago). It's likely that such gap will be found very surprising by potential partners, so I'd like to find ways to mitigate such discrepancy, so the whole dating process is as least awkward as possible.

Here's the question I'm looking to answer: What would be the best way to ""catch up"" in terms of all the little things that are expected by a romantic relationship? Questions like:

- What's the best way to let people know (verbally and non-verbally) that I'm open for a relationship?
- How can I find out if somebody is interested in me?
  - Conversely, how can figure out if they're flat out disinterested in me?
- I just had my first date, how can I know I'm interested in having a second date with that person?
- I tend to get nervous around people, especially in one-to-one conversations. If for some reason I'm personally not having a good time during a date, how can I tell it's because of the social situation or physical environment, instead of us not being a good match?

...and all those sorts of things. What makes this situation more interesting is that I'm not originally from the US (I was born and raised in Mexico), so I'm still in the phase of getting familiar with its customs and ways of social interaction, which to be honest it hasn't gone as smoothly as I had originally hoped, but I'm slowly getting there 😊.

In your experience, how would you think it'd be best way to tackle my situation? If I go down the route of consulting a therapist, what kind should I be looking for (e.g. a sexual therapist, one that's specialized in people on the autism spectrum)? Should I ask a friend with more experience to lend me their hand? How much of should I figure out by myself vs. by asking others?

Sorry for the verbosity -- this post ended up a little longer than expected. Hope you understand, and thanks for reading! 😁",6.7940000000000005,8.098055066666667,7.262150537634407,69.71322580645165,65.0,10.903225806451614,31.344086021505376,10.875528500678817,3.6353440860215054,2046,76,354,57,31,670,225,465,0.009000000000000001,0.846,0.14400000000000002,0.9952,0,0,0,0,0,0,90.0,2,3,2,4,24,22,0,2,28,0,31,1,1,11,3,76,69,30,0,13,11,0,3,3,2,6,0,0,0,4,29,22,0,0,17,3,0,5,4,2,0,4,8,7,32,20,65,47,15,62,0,0,4,0,29,26,0,12,28,244,61,3,0.0,0.0,0.07087174744677499,0.0,0.0,0.07096853350434508,0.12875576757458973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12930370297610566,0.20368435703069004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044271665676564965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228647092477196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06256020433399571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06432439681815831,0.07504127577761784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131242297284124,0.0,0.0,0.03672149806005502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13275628766137867,0.061774982911674485,0.0,0.15925963063179646,0.05611007197499713,0.0,0.18971842397423533,0.0,0.04127459144001795,0.1827437898789186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426647910833268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07562800040747984,0.11973878006964064,0.0,0.08192442194255757,0.0,0.0,0.07426421743266384,0.0,0.1064430557296604,0.1455791181104516,0.0,0.0,0.18296070435210984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04847790447812773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11593753022746554,0.0,0.053387899875306385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07723775523794105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09842546981051413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20139675841107055,0.12682709781597004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818740338543854,0.13910978833536308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16271375568129265,0.0,0.14528976536569355,0.0,0.0930511630840926,0.07467083139864616,0.0,0.2339169509899061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2449014017129933,0.0,0.1480645506485274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812979982463893,0.0,0.0,0.05799860190437488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05460513408552061,0.0,0.06347765146363314,0.06686355359937397,0.0,0.16864697753002642,0.14474692576743484,0.09307062886878252,0.0,0.0,0.042348355220688576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07560542493050339,0.17471841739286964,0.06272488008566174,0.0,0.11984684014485175,0.0,0.28823263281952405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108347487723244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10318175829959884,0.0,0.0,0.09353653306918784
autism,ARCT1C_MAN,2019/02/28,"How to (re)form a friendship with someone who has ASD? So recently, I fought with a close friend who apparently suffers from autism, mainly because she was putting unrealistic expectations for me in regards to making friends. After not talking for a while (because she told me not to), we decided to have another talk about the whole situation. I forgot about how autism can cause paranoia and the inability to understand another's emotions, so I talked about how I felt and whether we should remain friends. While at first she wanted to remain friends (I was asking her if it was okay and if it wasn't negatively impacting her emotionally) she later decided that she didn't want to remain my friend by the end of our talk and that she thought of me as a predator trying to use her (this was due to the fact that I did not talk to her for a while after our argument). She says she still wants to see me try and become her friend and that I have to put in a lot of effort to try and convince her. I still want to retain this friendship but I'm not sure what steps I should be prepared to take in order to do so. In addition, we are only able to talk at school and through video calls, since her parents are very hesitant to let me hangout with her outside of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I say in order to get her to emotionally reconsider being friends? It was a precious friendship for me. She says she doesn't understand how I feel but I don't understand the sudden shift from wanting to be friends still to suddenly not wanting to. I am also not sure if this is really due to her ASD or whether she is just manipulating me/playing with my emotions. I know this post may seem a little jumbled up, but I can be more clear if you need more information. She also told me a lot about how she FEELS rather than thinks, and I can explain what she told me if necessary? Is it worth being in this friendship?",6.964299191374664,6.47226879245283,7.133987870619947,76.9549979784367,64.57951482479784,10.223234501347713,35.26159029649595,9.642632912329526,3.1587971967654984,1506,62,294,26,20,487,166,371,0.054000000000000006,0.816,0.13,0.984,2,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,5,1,0,2,19,15,1,0,14,1,33,0,0,9,4,80,63,34,0,17,19,1,3,0,8,4,0,3,0,0,19,18,0,2,14,2,1,3,11,2,0,1,15,7,56,13,57,38,6,33,0,1,1,0,58,11,0,10,16,231,75,1,0.0752394631970409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033794307080856,0.0,0.08152192693927812,0.09142418315404,0.0,0.15779027482348884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033874150828487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09173055683493382,0.08309607583672482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768279042004707,0.0,0.0,0.07729165436735802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385370765671393,0.06663983213674655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07608666657068841,0.0,0.07224168379260161,0.0,0.0,0.0639986489593054,0.0,0.0,0.465038581011805,0.0,0.039309514126130714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041349641291141485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0769374487485674,0.0,0.0,0.07540970823963848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12793180204291713,0.0,0.0,0.05022292592803145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05578910860482935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057223002181410514,0.0,0.0,0.08354451989015739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07205860763415674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512728835844091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048200326740588134,0.0,0.07428989295060498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17950032307564154,0.0,0.07614635359863685,0.059956110881902926,0.06849518149797283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062238861459751625,0.08457230904340557,0.0,0.0,0.06375015300556611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802589974998008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14182460728147825,0.0,0.05657071265744699,0.3628477829854185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04821040998029435,0.0,0.05973172944885637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21568359420339805,0.0,0.15324796998814658,0.0,0.0,0.23498080395091345,0.0,0.06498273884359346,0.0,0.062080436851588684,0.2662691086853254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08400217370336133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09142418315404,0.0

[I wrote about it here](http://www.navigatingjourney.com) but i'm curious to know what kind of experiences you have had with this uncontrollable urge to say something and then realizing that ""omfg why did I do that?"".",7.0029437229437175,8.774369121212125,6.493391053391052,73.69818181818184,64.85858585858585,8.889466089466088,30.304473304473305,9.23628265651192,2.6722109668109666,449,16,75,8,7,139,68,99,0.109,0.85,0.041,-0.7633,0,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,1,0,6,5,0,1,0,0,9,1,0,1,0,21,18,8,0,3,3,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,0,1,12,9,0,0,3,0,0,3,2,3,0,0,8,6,13,2,11,9,0,8,0,2,2,0,11,2,0,1,3,58,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21619589225779406,0.24245664440255546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19788492314347592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15342995871951426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2282146754472853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16668573693676178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39537259687834014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19518334002220705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15416010564714813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.207784808009066,0.2193182356971705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16755899323961093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17422610691841062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12782711398076455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189803305212104,0.3173561924986253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16906520402633773,0.1536116515126572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13256206704060167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18913567674968154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849707756132051,0.18004913785554602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24245664440255546,0.0
autism,possibiIity,2019/02/28,"Deos it sound like this man has autism? Sorry if this is rude, I'm not trying to be. If speculating his mental condition is rude... IDK I apologize in advance and I'll delete this and just accept people as they are without trying to speculate their mental health... but I'm just curious that's all. I hope to be a better person and knowledgable citizen so I'm asking...

Anyways, I've noticed a guy around town in stores, etc... and he looks like a typical guy, nothing unusual or out of the ordinary. But his behavior is definitely uncommon, and I think he may have a mental disability... he speaks at a very high tone, almost like he's yelling but he appears to be in a good mood. 

He says ""hi"" to random people, mainly employees. His conversations with people are always very short... with me for example (I've run into him in multiple stores) he'll often say ""hi friend, how are you? are you in school? where are you going? ok bye friend"" and he'll walk away. 

Does it sound like he has autism? TBH he seems like an adorable guy and I wouldn't mind being his friend.",1.0110645604395607,3.5943543509615417,2.908104395604397,87.44403846153848,89.625,6.240659340659343,19.92857142857143,7.5804360353943165,1.0229706043956042,827,26,162,17,28,275,124,208,0.021,0.731,0.248,0.9949,1,0,0,0,1,0,44.0,0,3,2,2,8,17,2,0,8,1,17,1,0,1,1,36,29,16,0,4,10,0,0,5,3,4,1,6,0,6,6,12,0,0,4,0,2,5,3,2,0,0,0,7,15,14,21,21,3,19,0,0,1,0,38,14,0,10,6,91,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280315074880008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10638825598799492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138208959705996,0.11953014739112708,0.0,0.12012697766395725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11308017813372845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11188956306115938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14259567883456328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2963487596182384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07266475546166568,0.10724138297841423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37979912767297797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13590727628749713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13508919687735582,0.0,0.12699203141667648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31232526458109905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10736867708842736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3865529466853341,0.0,0.12910032290142615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12268338096979865,0.14556739593508186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26592230880068224,0.11164083916012962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20335592793680368,0.0,0.12939931357557605,0.0,0.11639729350389864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14312677499623075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08192636500402126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17361463538000715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2109927930997153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232507318370056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,squish-squish-beep,2019/02/28,"I don’t understand why people don’t like me. I try so hard and am very nice and yet no one ever wants to hang out or even message me. I haven’t had a close friend in 6 years. I think it’s my autism to blame but I really can’t tell. I’ve always tried very hard with people and am always so friendly and do everything I can to help people, but no one ever looks at me twice and I’m sure no one ever thinks about me. I have never had anyone interested in being my friend ever. I’m always ALWAYS the one left out of everything. If there’s someone without a partner it’s me. Someone who hasn’t been invited out, me. The one at the back of the photo, you guessed it. It’s me. Girls will take selfies with everyone in class except me. I wish I knew what made me so strange, so different. Am I that unapproachable or am I just that boring that no one cares or remembers me? Every time I went to a new school or workplace I said the same thing to myself “people will notice you this time and you WILL have at least one friend” all I want is at least someone who cared. Of course wherever I go it’s the same thing. I’m left out and have to experience unbearable loneliness. I know I’m not a great talker. I don’t know how to be social or properly interact with people. I don’t understand jokes or modern slang. And people don’t understand my sense of humour. But no one ever even tries to get to know me. I feel so... abnormal.

autism,whyisthecarpetwet,2019/02/28,"My autistic son starts school in the fall. I’m afraid they won’t challenge him academically. I don’t know where else I can put this, but I would love some insight on how everyone here thinks I should approach the school district about the issue. 

We are starting the meetings. He is transitioning out of the preschool for children with disabilities into the school district. They said there are a lot of options for types of classrooms and supports. We have another meeting in 2 weeks. This meeting is called a screening, but I don’t know what that means exactly. 

Here’s the situation. His most recent ados says asd level 2. He needs a ton of sensory input. He is always bouncing and flapping and pushing his body for input. I know this isn’t going to go over well in a typical kindergarten class. 

The other part that makes it more complicated for me is that he is SMART. Like wicked smart. He writes, reads, spells, does addition and subtraction and just started with double digit addition. All self taught for the most part. If I see him showing interest, I show him the next step. 

So here is the dilemma. Are they going to be able to stimulate him physically and mentally? What do I ask for to help accomplish this? Is this considered gifted? Should I push for that? 

My fear is that they will stick him in a classroom with no academic challenge for him or in a classroom that won’t allow him to move around. Either situation and he won’t thrive. 

What should I do?",3.7757357859531737,6.2522285579710175,4.197826086956521,83.87342809364551,75.01449275362319,7.289632107023412,27.64437012263099,8.263242389622931,2.0335517279821618,1166,47,215,21,26,366,155,276,0.048,0.805,0.147,0.9816,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,2,0,4,3,13,11,0,2,17,0,27,2,1,4,2,46,47,13,0,6,6,1,0,1,0,8,0,2,0,2,16,17,0,0,6,3,0,10,7,2,1,0,2,4,29,9,31,36,11,28,0,0,2,1,34,12,0,7,7,152,45,15,0.13113803932444595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10911735396723836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375096683679664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11674065787762902,0.12259636443429968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14566479873469745,0.0,0.0,0.1339066002620329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475978193647488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095490045899039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12530801637172168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475667527851317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22358630947615446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08789906348794516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13687404232247954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21621011057011535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06406742197569783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11148887149297948,0.11835720046120365,0.0,0.08753565955263158,0.0,0.0,0.14284776925789866,0.0,0.0,0.13215629964301778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393789822375241,0.0,0.09723719451501392,0.0,0.0,0.13946679255016786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28401943455946643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13182995009057144,0.0,0.0,0.13117352714029953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12948299322194615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247423057063856,0.1042862323662884,0.0,0.3981560907663653,0.1045000388423964,0.0,0.13680557515906128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.294809301338277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27846053759288114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488138929693067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08402796047715755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519102502147767,0.0,0.11790884639807075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931567006019278,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,warlockfighter,2019/02/28,"My autistic son is being bullied and now denying it. Advice needed Hi All,

My son is five years old and in the process of being diagnosed with Autism. He attends mainstream school, and is doing well academically, but struggles socially and is very difficult to communicate with outside of his obsessions. When asked what he's done at school. I get two maybe three words out of him, only to find out from my wife later what has actually been going on. My wife came to me and said that two of the horrible little turds in his class (they have a history of being unpleasant to our son) were telling him to kill himself, trapping him under a bench and telling him he couldn't have food or water, and basically followed him around the playground tormenting him. I questioned him several hours later to see if I got the same story and I did. (This is one of the ways we try and determine if what has happened is as he described, because he often misinterprets situations or fabricates a narrative around otherwise innocuous events that turn out to be nothing). We informed the school and told him to stay away from them and tell the teachers if anything else happens. The teachers questioned my son and his story has completely changed, saying he doesn't know what we are talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I am concerned he has been told not to say anything by these two little scrotal warts, and I am asking for advice from the hive mind on how to get the information out of him and get through to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.

autism,turquioseshade,2019/02/28,"How to support my autistic boyfriend? I'm a woman with ADHD and I'm dating a man with high functioning autism. 

He's currently in college taking disability studies because he wants to help others autistic people professionally. I find that very admirable and noble. He had a great first semester but it's been tough for him this semester. One of his assignments requires calling 9 different companies and he says he can't do it. And he's been extremely discouraged and completely shut down, saying things like ""this is a field I can't do. I can't work. I'm scared I'm going to be homeless."" I tried telling him that he's catastrophizing and he responded ""well, life is a catastrophe.""

It's very hard for me to deal with what he says when he shuts down like this, and his negativity starts to affect me to, and then I start catastrophizing. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced any of this? I want to help him and support him the best that I can, but I really struggle when he shuts down and assumes worst case scenario is reality.

autism,chewy_rat,2019/02/28,"Need advice for getting a job while in school    I should probably start out by saying I have social anxiety, ocd, depression, and am on the autism spectrum. Im living in north atlanta, going to school for software development, and need another job to keep myself financially afloat. I am having trouble with anxiety and shutting down.

   Half of my jobs in the past have been retail and they have all taken a hard toll on my mental health and social life. The undervalued staff, unstable schedules, and customer interactions are stressful and I end up burned out pretty quickly. Typically leading to a depression spiral. These past experience have left strong negative feelings toward the industry and I find myself between needing to get more stable income and mental blocks keeping me from doing what I need too.

   Recently I have been lucky with doing odd and end jobs for friends and friends of friends. With that independence, my social circle has grown and my mental health has improved vastly but im running out of work to do for people and im cutting it closer and closed every month. I have been filing applications with I.T. temp agencies for a few months to no anvil and this month I need to find something asap.


   tl;dr I shutdown when searching for jobs because Im afraid of having to work a retail job and the depression and isolation that will follow.


I need advice wether it be how to overcome this job anxiety, or how to get temp agencies to take notice or what ever you might have.

autism,caffeinated_catholic,2019/03/01,My daughter barely sleeps and I can’t cope My 10 year old (autism and partial trisomy 13) has been seeing a host of specialists. None can figure out why she can’t stay asleep. None are willing to prescribe real sleep medication. She wakes anywhere from 5-12 times a night. Kicking and screaming. Full body tantrum.

autism,The_Deuteragonist,2019/03/01,"I discussed getting tested with my parents, and their reactions confused me I’m a 21M, and have never had any sort of testing done on my in regards to autism. I’m not gunna list off any behaviors or things like that, but my whole life people have always asked me if I was on the spectrum or if I had been tested, and my answers are always “I don’t know and no” respectively, but I’ve always been fairly open to the idea that I might be, but never really cared enough to have it tested. Recently, my partners mother asked if I was on the spectrum, and this really made me curious because she has worked with SpecEd for almost 30 years now, and while she isn’t a doctor, her word holds more weight than most others. I brought it up to my parents that I’d like to be tested (still on their health insurance) and while they said ok, they weren’t sure why I’d want to be tested. My dad was more like “I mean, you’re already an adult so I don’t really see what difference it would make, but if you want to than for it”, while my mother was a bit more critical. She says that she’s ok as well, but she said she is adverse to people always jumping to “put a label” on things, and that whatever habits I have, she has always assumed it to just be me, not some disorder. Beyond that, my mother also was worried about having this listed in my medical history and coming back to bite me later on. A situation she explained to me was that if I got into a car accident, or was being reviewed for a job, that they might want to look at my medical history and see that I’m autistic (assuming I am) and that this morning might create issues for me. She didn’t explain what those might be, but I took her word for it as she has been in the legal business for over 30 years as well, and I don’t think this is some fear-mongering. 

I intend on getting tested regardless, but does my mothers worries have any base? Could having a diagnosis be an issue later in life? Thank you for you help in advance.",7.861965174129352,5.501580221393038,8.295621890547263,75.36517412935326,63.95024875621891,11.221890547263682,34.273631840796014,9.586721724236666,2.9688348258706467,1547,48,313,23,18,517,186,402,0.061,0.823,0.116,0.9537,4,0,0,1,0,0,41.0,0,3,5,2,10,13,0,1,14,2,46,7,0,3,3,69,74,35,0,11,18,7,1,3,1,5,6,3,0,2,26,17,1,1,9,0,0,7,11,2,2,0,21,7,54,11,47,40,9,39,0,0,3,0,38,19,0,20,16,238,80,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950997903825125,0.0,0.09864277243564344,0.0714841974725472,0.371893245273786,0.0,0.0,0.18236236416462068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16713293777973515,0.0,0.0,0.06873447572001179,0.0,0.054490587687681565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975894268516765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09113784722080652,0.0,0.0,0.07700054307704488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07136968956471115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09339227893541514,0.10244731826580802,0.09149323272921092,0.07822474827254612,0.09147578572834997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236253381178514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005872605823161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09340392559938514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149239559085033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501612290849427,0.0,0.0,0.059915433775773415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10090908380334147,0.0,0.18659738324788028,0.08870459903335437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04912575116454647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262759172811074,0.13101256917586726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750640855841724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08458185147266667,0.059667723464012,0.0,0.0,0.09737061715296176,0.0,0.18009963978666435,0.0,0.37930959722152596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13788431876936955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19851138569197854,0.0,0.0,0.1239418887510079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08986044140730126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717942780327274,0.0,0.08826066396648699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1700584525024716,0.0710855679358199,0.0,0.0,0.14246261355642392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10047676545062408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0713860175472505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424789367897187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08229720465307275,0.0,0.0,0.11877190418924274,0.0572767388127281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993142547430095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15817150485031176,0.0,0.0,0.10885148667450076,0.16074254713556335,0.0,0.0806594956918741,0.09979941188791913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06507611684888166,0.18155734714598634,0.0,0.063499244522097,0.0,0.0,0.1151269232660995

autism,birdgoesmeow,2019/03/01,"Son says abc's Our almost four year old says the whole alphabet. When asked by us or his speech therapist he will recite them perfectly. Then when asked to say a word (such as cup or dad, or even just ""I"" as a word) he will shake his head and scream. The words he does say come and go out of nowhere.

autism,Throwaway7644358,2019/03/01,"Please help with pointers I was diagnosed about 17 years ago and rediagnosed about 12 years ago, I'm 25 now. I'm doing a masters in math. 
I think I've grown to be pretty extravert (probably always was) and socially equipped (definitely was not) through tons of focused practise. I can also do the whole social / charming / teasing thing when I'm hungry however when I'm tired it all breaks down. I become the biggest asshole in the world. How do you guys/girls deal with being tired? Do you have default patterns/rules you resort to? When I'm hungry I've learnt that if I ignore the Hunger I can still sort of function. I just need to be aware that my ability to sense ""going too far"" starts to break down so I have to be extra careful with jokes. 
When I'm tired not only does my social sensing break down but also my filter in what I say gets harder to maintain.

Also I keep running into the issue that my humour often doesn't match with that of other people at all. Normal humour is often related to teasing and making hyperboles.
However I also love absurd stuff like when giving a terrible solutions to problems and saying it in such a way that people will take you seriously at first and then realize it makes absolutely no sense. Do you also have this issue?

I also genuinely like being overanthusistic about small stuff like exploring a lecture building I've never been in before. Last week I met someone that also likes that for the very first time in my life. It was so strange I thought I was the only one. Do you also have this?

autism,YourDadsNewGF,2019/03/02,"Can you please tell me if this is normal? My 14 year old SS has high functioning autism. He is in therapy because he has already repeatedly threatened his biomom with violence and has done such things as chasing her into her room wielding a knife on one occasion and a frying pan on another. Today was the first time that we were going to have a therapy session at our house instead of biomom's and I wasn't sure who all was going to be involved so I asked him to take his computer off of the table so everyone would have a comfortable place to sit (he doesn't yet have a desk in his room, although we do plan to do that when we can afford it, so in the meantime when he comes over he sets his computer up at our dining room table.) He argued, and I tried explaining why, that his therapist was coming over and I wasn't sure if this session would include the whole family, and if so, we would need that seat.) He argued that it was too much work to take the whole set up upstairs to his room, so my husband (his father) stepped in with a compromise that if he didn't want to take it up to his room, he could stow it in our downstairs coat closet (in the same room as the table.) He said no, repeatedly, so my husband went to go take the computer away himself. At that point, my SS physically attacked my husband. He hit him and jumped on his back and started clawing his face. My husband restrained my SS by pinning his arms to his sides, and kept telling him to stop. My SS responded by telling my husband that he was going to murder all of us tonight with a knife. Eventually SS stopped struggling, and husband let him go and again went to go get the computer. SS again ran up and hit husband. Got restrained again, and continued threats to murder all of us. Eventually SS gave in and put the computer in the coat closet, and then stormed upstairs which is where he had his therapy session. After the therapy session, he apologized and now SS and husband are playing Mario together and laughing. But frankly, I'm scared of the violence that I saw and heard from SS. Is this normal for either people with autism or teenagers? Before SS I didn't have experience with either. But I'm shaken and don't feel safe even though he apologized.",6.664041095890411,6.2584709863013686,6.8297831050228295,78.60166095890412,65.16438356164383,10.131050228310505,35.14497716894977,9.621722640351123,3.1615141552511425,1764,74,345,31,24,568,198,438,0.115,0.852,0.033,-0.9876,1,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,9,1,0,3,20,14,6,2,20,0,36,3,2,0,5,63,68,40,2,12,9,9,1,0,0,3,0,2,8,0,19,32,1,6,2,1,0,14,7,8,0,2,21,4,46,6,55,39,9,73,0,0,1,0,69,34,0,5,22,237,65,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10286103437257478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09774021993105043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871400226963755,0.10604135859940317,0.08757512467403912,0.07167376884332521,0.0,0.056820769274111824,0.0,0.07931598718707351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16058663625502295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07442167236596345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09538756573575533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06156521267020575,0.0,0.0,0.08906743230971892,0.0,0.09117857888754376,0.08787135817770378,0.0,0.04713045549073693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928552037278587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04869907933640037,0.0,0.3178449242317001,0.0,0.07454962567121608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984829010827586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10755337453107022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953149130392348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06852106182329529,0.06911502943883033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18265465015283455,0.0,0.0,0.09780962419141832,0.0,0.06316241805376333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06462100853530266,0.0,0.09738601396241432,0.10231806330073924,0.08811484729688816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937031444281594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866533196649556,0.0,0.0933208147624956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06597546802701047,0.0,0.0,0.1558577122318751,0.0,0.09744473360612814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17570117452210732,0.0,0.2803333172709344,0.0,0.2444124655865517,0.0,0.4263811747102198,0.10822555298707104,0.06192547420175401,0.0,0.09157967081493554,0.0,0.05435228343817708,0.0,0.08835345383990123,0.0,0.0,0.06328438305163428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2242435366029918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497846487024505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17281569681326198,0.08410873857229996,0.2081342704203372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06785896753250402,0.0,0.0,0.1986439901924279,0.0,0.0,0.06002504856100355

autism,camaroluvr447,2019/03/02,"Help please. Im desperate and dont know what to do. Hi this is my first post on reddit.

 Im 28 years old (guy) and I am the caretaker of my 26 year old brother who is high functioning autistic (he can drive very short well rehearsed distances, he has had a job at a hotel in the past but had trouble keeping it, just to give you an idea), schizophrenic, is also diagnosed with cognitive delays and some other development issues. 10 months ago I moved him in with me because my mother could not longer handle him and still take care of my two younger siblings living at home. He is 6'2 190 lbs and has no physical or mobility issues. He is not a small guy.

My brother has behavioral issues (explosive arguments are  weekly or daily routine, these only occur with family members, he presents himself very well to non family) that range from being nasty and mean on a daily basis to extreme outbursts and meltdowns that can get somewhat physical and occure one to 3 times a week. He is extremely narcissistic and manipulative, has no consideration or compassion for others and extraordinarily self centered.

My parents are divorced and while I am gainfully employed the rest of my siblings (im the oldest of 6) are young and money is very tight. I help out a lot with various things in the family but I am not in a financial position yet to pay for a separate place for my brother to live.

I think much of his behavior issues are because he is very isolated (no hobbies, job, social life, sense of purpose or accomplishments, he just sits in the house all day every day and that would take a toll on anybody), there is a tremendous amount of resentment and negativity built up between him and the two other brothers that live with me as well as myself, and I work full time and have little time to spend with him. The two brothers that live with me also work and are in college but do help out when they can. again he spends much of his time alone in the house with nothing to do or look forward to.

He is destroying my life and everyone in our family. He is the nastiest, meanest, most ungrateful person by far I have ever met. Everyone in our family has sacrificed money, untold amounts of time and energy, and he doesn't care in the least. He verbally eviscerates each person in my house on a daily basis. My home is a nightmare because of him. There is no peace. Sometimes he raises hell at 2 or 3 in the morning. Police have been called on several occasions (a couple time he called them and a couple times he left the house and caused a scene in the neighborhood). On top of that he has hygiene issues. I am paying $2000 this week to get him crowns on his front teeth because they would have to be pulled otherwise. I cant bear the thought of my brother missing his front teeth. the embarrassment would be horrible for him.

I have spent a lot of time to get him a caseworker, counselor, psychiatrist, he has medicaid and SSDI. I dont know what to do. I cant have him in my house any longer. 

When he was younger he responded well to horses and other animals. I have thought that maybe there is a ranch style place he could live and work that is made for developmentally disabled adults. It could even be for a year to allow for some healing and me the time to try and buy a small house for him to live in. 

Having transportation for recreational activities or work would help a lot I think. I think that if he had some activities in his life and some sense of purpose and accomplishment or something to look forward to and do every day his behavior issues would lessen.

He is destroying my life and he is an awful person but he is suffering and my brother and I want to help him if I can in any way.


If anyone knows of transportation services, places for people like him to live, support groups, or anything please let me know. I feel like I'm drowning slowly. I'm extremely desperate. I don't know what to do. any advice is appreciated.

Thank you.

autism,Leviathan3333,2019/03/02,"Trying to find answers... I feel I may be on the spectrum. I’m not sure but I’ve done self diagnosis tests and they all come up as that it is a strong possibility.

I’m no doctor and I have alienated most of the people in my life....life in general feels like a struggle and really confusing when I feel I have all the tools to be successful but can seem to use them. If anything those tools work against me.

I’m finding it’s difficult to even find a way to someone who could diagnose me. Any resource that exists seems to be for children or charities for helping people already diagnosed with the condition and are is worse states than myself.

I feel lost and the only time anything made sense was when I read descriptions of symptoms and behaviours of people on the spectrum.

I wish someone could help me because I’m so tired of feeling like someone who lives just outside the circle of society.",4.616618037135279,6.150108787356322,5.4989655172413805,79.47720159151196,70.32183908045978,8.802122015915119,32.350132625994696,9.265573868473778,3.0101490716180384,715,33,132,15,13,234,109,174,0.129,0.706,0.165,0.8407,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,2,4,5,9,0,2,10,0,14,5,0,2,3,37,30,14,0,4,6,0,5,2,0,1,5,0,0,2,7,8,0,0,11,1,0,1,2,4,0,0,4,5,15,5,22,20,3,11,0,1,0,0,8,5,0,7,5,88,22,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372200379019053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08456024333959297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20465401860630705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758007943529673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10711395451088802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19856196790304664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2524192326423297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727445258152198,0.0,0.12725018239871688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08213003950013678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3143679687950573,0.17766708384055396,0.0,0.0,0.3409527936084759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16669438400030098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08782998352320384,0.12149935411076312,0.0,0.10980070420257633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13573947040437845,0.0,0.0,0.11766016483838035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457151837457556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.258619718182743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14018259101394806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12438067845169802,0.0,0.07965989046776918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22640172897848315,0.129721069679395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31607650087466743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12999451269701695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11719560266137607,0.12924417411347655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07250775222060472,0.14291861693581007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08442346991660507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073959080492561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09870088325017493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14299294592385173,0.0,0.0,0.0905261176264922,0.0,0.12672024518290312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,finnelliot121,2019/03/02,"I’m at a point in life where i’m doing okay for the first time I have infantile / childhood autism and I tried to figure out how to get through life the whole time. The last months except for a few days was the first time where I felt like i’m doing okay and that I actually getting “the hang of it”. I’m set with all my medications without them being too much or high and I haven’t had any major meltdowns. 

I had my last therapy sessions for now since i’m moving abroad and they didn’t go well but i’m still okay with it. I’m actually really happy about how it is and how I am at the moment. For the first time life doesn’t seem too much, still overwhelming but manageable with everything that I have learned and i’m glad i was able to reach this point and hope it will continue to get easier.

Just wanted to say this since I was told most of my life it will not get better and nothing will change - It did get better and it changed. It was a lot of work with different kinds of therapy sometimes 4-5 times and it tought me enough to reach this point. Some stuff will probably never change but right now I’m okay with that.

autism,bondies,2019/03/02,"Autism Diagnosis as an Adult I am an adult who lives in Australia and has always felt a little different to others. I'm going to say straight up that I understand that this is not a place to get diagnosed, and to get properly assessed I would need the help of trained professionals, and this is not what I the point of this post. 

Basically I am interested if other people have been diagnosed with Autism as an adult and if there is any real point to perusing a diagnosis? As it wouldn't change anything, and if I am autistic it doesn't have to define me, it is just part of what makes me who I am. Given the opportunity again, would you do it? Would you not? And Why?

Part of some activities I did at work included some of those annoying ""how do you learn"", ""what colour thinker are you"" and ""what drives you"" sort of pseudo-psychological tests that employers like to do after going on management courses. After begrudgingly appeasing their tests my manager came back to me and said that maybe I was ""on the spectrum"" and that I might benefit from having that looked into further. Since then other colleagues I have worked with have made similar observations; at a training conference I was given the nickname ""Sheldon"" by another attendee and when I contributed to the class they would knock on the table and say ""Penny, Penny, Penny"" (I know this is a reference to The Big Bang Theory), another colleague recently saying ""have you been assessed?"" she was not privy to the previous pseudo tests that I had performed. When I mentioned to my Mum that I thought I might be somewhere on the spectrum she wasn't very surprised.

I know that I have some mannerisms that are different to others, and I struggle with things that others seem to not struggle with, and if I put a list together in my head it would make sense.

* I sometimes get moments of dyspraxia, especially if I am under stress, or anxious. As a pre-schooler I went to speech therapy 
* I have trouble getting cues from people: it is hard for me to know when to it is time to talk in a group or on a phone call, I will often accidentally talk over someone else because I think they have finished speaking.
* I like to have structure, routine, and know about planned events in advance. I get quite frustrated &amp; emotional when events get changed.
* I am very clumsy and lack coordination.
* I often catch myself subconsciously rubbing my beard and/or moving my feet around.
* When something makes me anxious I have been known to freeze up and become unable to function, not being able to make even the simplest of decisions or explain how I am feeling.

TLDR - Colleagues and family think I might be somewhere on the autism spectrum, I can see some mannerisms, and social struggles I have that may support their opinion. I am wondering it would benefit me at all to get investigated further, what are any benefits for adults to find out they are autistic?",6.765478834524464,7.695660371962621,6.890316107751513,73.6887231995602,64.90654205607477,10.03243540406817,34.987630566245194,10.056822442137396,3.622632765255636,2309,103,399,50,34,741,252,535,0.06,0.875,0.065,0.3988,3,0,1,0,0,0,72.0,0,6,5,7,16,16,2,4,24,0,61,4,2,7,1,90,98,38,0,14,15,1,5,2,0,12,2,6,0,4,38,26,0,0,19,0,0,9,9,7,0,0,17,14,63,9,68,66,8,54,0,0,3,0,34,28,0,22,18,309,101,11,0.07890721162570963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06565712119752039,0.0854959308293716,0.0,0.1073192194981304,0.16548218287216054,0.0,0.17828537818444734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493391183780163,0.07024414764723003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06067477508867436,0.0,0.04810110381677325,0.08714681581583025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08057308542499958,0.09024882897878084,0.0,0.0,0.16694673435423796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601783176326785,0.0,0.164882483209958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591685016103471,0.08875999245859494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052117469087144465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438669655872349,0.0,0.039897857094388735,0.0,0.07576329746388467,0.0,0.07211976190122937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2885803290956343,0.0,0.08968957356859257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706853626607495,0.0,0.08098156385908324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05288984066007788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17346135963051926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771001556862172,0.07908575571724966,0.06967651351263424,0.0,0.06626218447652521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07466391153680617,0.21068470593880453,0.0,0.07927289992812263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25112424579487075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08386587830844712,0.0,0.05850869759081561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17089764147800895,0.0,0.10940865039352356,0.0,0.082441241604979,0.0,0.14918564010212412,0.0,0.07557129676951238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07932354200193018,0.0,0.08392753244460706,0.0,0.08981368181715216,0.0,0.0,0.07791135204344796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07505882782569441,0.18825054536500133,0.0,0.07985831082019286,0.06287883151456204,0.07183416191643559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06527286086141286,0.0,0.0,0.08043596523293606,0.0668578243468836,0.06074662656703742,0.0780412499500037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038794431761124,0.2474728505508842,0.0,0.0,0.08954296866009206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12684525550538495,0.0,0.0,0.09023727332568132,0.0,0.05242244519978023,0.10112111015238938,0.0,0.06264351200974426,0.04601142965393805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214519011464425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13021342684585951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314777571455768,0.07120148526055449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855715050517892,0.11489077968774272,0.0,0.0,0.336320515082411,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,redflyblueeye,2019/03/03,"Diagnosed with ASD almost a year ago...desperately need help In 2018 I was diagnosed with having Autism Spectrum Disorder while being considered more on the ""high functioning"" side of the spectrum. Growing up I understood I wasn't like everyone else in terms of my personality or my social abilities. If I had to describe my social abilities I would probably relate best to the character Silent Bob from the movie ""Jay and Silent Bob"" or at least that's how I feel. I feel imprisoned in my own body, daydreaming of having a normal social life, but feeling I live my life more like a voyeur almost. 

  
I've graduated college and have a job but because I stress over the social aspects and not fitting in at work I tend to need long ""recharge"" days or weekends. I've tried to make any work situation better over time but I realized that even though I like the job a lot it's not the same feeling I got from my previous jobs. I felt that what I really need is to spend my free time practicing being social. I realized that even though it would be nice to feel like I fit in at work and matter, it might not make me happy. After many suicidal episodes I realized that I need to find a way to be social and meet new people outside of work. I've always wanted to pick up social skills but no matter how hard I tried it just felt like something was off.   


How can I get back into socializing without it draining my mental and physical energy? I've given thought to messaging old friends or contacts but since it's been so long and everyone's either married, become successful, or moved out of the area it makes it difficult for me to reach out. Just thinking about it stresses me out because I've been so isolated for so long that it can be hard for me to communicate or keep a conversation going, which leads to me stressing out before and after for a very long time. Instead, I would like to ask the r/autism community if there are subreddits for people with ASD looking to meet new people and hangout? I would prefer to hang out with a neurotypical around my age who is open/understands the difficulties I'm having but doesn't view it as a stigma. I want to make new friends while also being able to learn verbal/nonverbal communication. I'm envisioning how Winnie the Pooh and the other characters treat Eeyore. They all know he's depressed but they don't knock him for it or treat him any differently but they still make sure he's included.   


Not sure if this is helpful but I have a Fine Arts degree. I'm very knowledgeable on the subject I studied in and could make more money doing freelance work but I can't handle the level of social skills required. Because of that I focus more on the technical and education aspect but because of the problems I've been facing lately I'm losing all interest or ability to focus or further myself in this field. Again, I gave it some thought and have come to the conclusion that I need to practice or exercise these weaknesses to at least be content with myself. I know it doesn't seem like socializing could be so draining but I have a hard time finding the energy or even maintaining it.   


  
I apologize for the bad grammar. I find writing to be difficult when talking about my problems or seeking help because I also want to try and remain anonymous on here. (I tend to be too honest and explain too much)

autism,hererightnowrightnow,2019/03/03,"Coping with the lesser-discussed aspects of autism. Having aspergers is difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Having aspergers, a medical condition, and no support system is a travesty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm three months behind rent. I'll have to come up with something this week if I don't want to be sleeping on snow. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only job where I was employed for longer than a year was the military. In university, certain professors discriminated against my assignments because I refused to give answers they wanted. In classes where the grades were based on critical thinking,essays, and developing arguments, I received satisfactory grades. In classes such as political science, however, I was docked points for suggesting a different interpretation of historical documents (based on superfluous evidence from historians and political scientists). Some professors hated that I did my own research instead of believing the arguments of elite academics (although, admittedly, a majority of the content is factual and true). American education is based on regurgitating answers; it's not based on critical thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

My psychologist mentioned that oppositional defiance is tied into my autism. I know that I've never been credulous enough to believe in a claim due to the authority of the person making that claim. I've always understood the flimsiness and impermanence of laws, policies, social norms, theories, and traditions. This symptom isn't commonly discussed when talking about autism, but I've noticed it in many people with the disorder. I remember a young child prodigy in physics and math who was featured because he was questioning Einstein's long-established physics theories. The child had autism. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

People don't like that I question them. People don't like that I act differently than them. People at work don't like that I

do things differently than them. They'd rather follow established rules and believe every policy was created by some ethereal  group of 'others' who can't be questioned or challenged. I don't buy it, and people don't like it. I'll walk into the owner of the company's office and tell him his policy is illogical. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it hasn't worked out so far. The tension between me and professors led to me skipping classes and dropping out of school. I had a good opportunity with an online school (Western Governors University), but the lying, ignorant salesmen they call ""recruitment officers"" turned me off. I left my jobs after the company implicitly asked me to lie to clients. Now I'm at home figuring out where to go from here.

autism,nota-failure,2019/03/03,"How do I talk to my daughter about having autism? My daughter is 12 and I am struggling with how to tell her, but this is why; She has been through the assessment process for auditory processing disorder, adhd, and now asd (about 3 years of assessments, drs appointments, referrals, wait lists). It wasn't until I spent a summer working with other kids on the spectrum that I noticed some similarities and so I asked for a reassessment. We're still on the wait list for the official asd diagnosis and now they're also revisiting adhd. She does know she's different than her peers and she accepts it, I've also heard her say things like, 'making friends is hard' and 'I don't have any friends at school.' I don't know if it would it be better for her to know now or wait for a diagnosis? (Also we've been waiting for 6 months now with no indication that she will be seen soon) What if I'm wrong? I also feel like I'm telling her something's wrong with her, and that's not the message I want to send.

autism,givemefuelgimmefire,2019/03/03,"Self Defeat Or Being Kind To Myself?  

I have this ongoing debate where I'm torn between these two things.

Do I continue trying to persue a career that I know I'll be interested in and have a stable income but struggle with working hours, maintenance, fear of losing the job, exhaustion etc

Or

Do I admit to myself that I have an illness and find a way of making it work for me/make adjustments for it such as selling crafts or paintings online (some things go for alot of money) and blogging where I know I can work from my own comfort, control my working environment, take a rest when I need one, remove the pressure of a boss and fear of job loss, removing myself from the rat race but possibly have uncertainty in income and possibly isolation? Although I'm free to met friends as and when I feel like it.

Some thoughts/feedback would be great to hear.

I really don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing here.

I'm in my 30's, I live alone (with pets), I have no-one depending on me and I'm happily single",4.3815763546798046,5.3305205320197055,5.64332512315271,80.4288300492611,70.2807881773399,8.755665024630543,28.785714285714285,9.04235418022936,2.3191536945812805,800,29,156,15,14,268,121,203,0.195,0.643,0.161,-0.7851,4,2,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,8,6,17,0,4,12,0,14,2,0,4,0,32,29,19,0,3,7,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,12,9,0,1,7,1,3,3,1,9,0,2,1,2,19,9,24,24,7,14,0,3,0,0,5,6,0,9,5,110,31,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14118193535682916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11381790012766732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15288962793975147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15202801827551346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067860793652137,0.06892530438525599,0.09738395008791613,0.0,0.0,0.12459006330777425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10531715736734036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07747134318234446,0.114335126173416,0.0,0.15028852007055749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15363768015219845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13424348755679327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2705445600323904,0.0,0.0,0.14195180544129474,0.2247466007384024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06659695640108115,0.0,0.12036924416768087,0.0,0.0,0.1525023793774496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09099177589786248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10107635056918952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09237103364978223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30735089812693833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08732731611989643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14220698513120714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425067475925968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10249242777860096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.362248326617263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925493997299542,0.0,0.13316061336472054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820104298773076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3969577585233653,0.0,0.0,0.09683474903685764,0.0,0.0,0.0

I need advice on ways to handle my anger when it arises, I have tried walking, gaming and a variety of other things to try to control these issues to no avail. I turned to smoking marijuana on a regular basis a couple of years ago and found that whilst it worked for a period of time it gave me other anxiety issues so I stopped.

autism,Nicksiee,2019/03/03,"Advice on how to teach the importance of a healthy lifestyle My sister is autistic (fairly high functioning) and now that she is married and moved out it has become evident that neither she nor her husband (not autistic but has learning impairments) understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle. She eats junk food because they like it and it’s easy to cook, drinks fizzy drinks instead of water, and needs motivating to exercise. I need to help her understand why it is important long term to stay healthy but she has difficulty with long term thinking. She only really understands short term impacts, which makes it difficult when she doesn’t see immediate results to keep her going.

How can I get through to her that her lifestyle needs to improve? She’s already overweight and depressed, but she doesn’t seem to understand that it only gets worse from here if she doesn’t change.",9.938101265822784,9.532577841772149,8.468196202531647,69.52672468354434,58.55696202531646,11.950632911392406,43.16772151898734,11.20814326018867,5.023212658227848,721,37,116,16,8,219,95,158,0.098,0.7140000000000001,0.188,0.9408,0,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,1,6,3,0,0,4,0,10,8,0,5,0,28,25,13,0,4,5,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,11,7,7,1,8,4,0,2,6,2,0,0,0,1,18,1,17,25,4,14,0,1,1,0,18,4,0,2,8,78,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374205525992045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15518705796075394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08572583455438468,0.15531314090060844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14876631712197447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12112312977467322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2755248043360089,0.0,0.14389807388587209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17004855274924371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14694518470890122,0.0,0.07992242313484459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426032606870348,0.14858174207266328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12499708136002598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870398666578187,0.0,0.0,0.24890361242073736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09387062256017856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494658508464637,0.0,0.31282277525908464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21390863794868534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09009022463618896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11206271539886616,0.12802291405325045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498912806599608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901090710090586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5855969546171519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268953570945768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433124661287321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,bubblesdomino,2019/03/03,"I got rejected from the only grad school in the country that offers the program I want to take after a Skype interview. Like the title says. I feel like crap because I exceed their minimum requirement for Admissions so i know I was rejected because of the interview and the thing is I didn’t think I did that poorly. Their website says that you can request feedback which I did and they never mention that the interview is a considering factor for admission, Rather all documents I submitted is what they consider for admission so I’m at a loss here and devastated. An acquaintance commented on the fairness of a mandatory interview round (especially with more than one person) for applicants in the spectrum and suggested that I disclose my condition but I don’t want them to see this as an excuse.

I want to know if I have autism, but I've seen a lot of things saying that an autism diagnosis can be harmful to us transfolk.

I was wondering if any of you know of any way I can determine if I objectively do have autism without having an official diagnosis in my medical info? I'm hoping somebody will mention some type of online diagnosis with a psychiatrist so that I can easily communicative in relative anonymity.

autism,Wubbalubbadubdub624,2019/03/04,"A question about your parents and if they pushed you beyond your means Fuck this is hard to ask....My dads autistic at least that’s what my parents and uncle tell me.  Well he died last week and I’ve been sitting here at my uncles house trying to figure out how he worked because bonding and relating to him was something I was never able to do.  He got worse with old age like as if he was stuck in an infinite loop of some sort.  Talking with my mom she pointed out he changed most after me and my brother were born as if the pressures of children threw him off his routine and it was too hard.  

Sitting here with my uncle kinda got the same thing his parents were popular in the military community and they had a desired fit in They described it and this being the 1950’s someone with autism was just odd imagine as in there wasn’t a label.... my aunt even said his parents when they were younger routinely pushed him out of his comfort zone join the military, get a job, buy a house,  get married, have kids. She theorized him just being him and left to his means and desires was his comfort zone. What ever time there was when things were a certain way he was comfortable with I imagine. Those changes that are a natural part of life yet are uncomfortable at times were hard on him and made his life difficult. For folks who are like this would you say that is accurate? Is it difficult to change a routine and do you feel pressure or difficulty’s when it changes?

My apologies if I’m wording anything wrong or being insensitive but my dads gone I miss him and I could never figure out who the hell he was I’m sure there are things I could’ve done better as a son as well and I wish I had tried to figure that out. But if I can.

autism,spiritedskin,2019/03/04,"Get your kids vaccinated you twat So basically, people STILL refuse to get their kids vaccinated because they're scared of their kid becoming autistic.

Number one, this claim was brought up by a quack 'doctor'. 

Number two, studies are constantly showing that there is ZERO correlation between autism and vaccines.

Number three, which one would you choose, a dead child or an autistic one?

Sure, it's hard for us. But it's harder to die a painful and meaningless death.

Anti vaxxers are so deathly afraid and/or hate autistic people, they'd rather risk their child's life than give them something that they believe would give them autism.

autism,Frenchfritters,2019/03/04,"Tips to help cope from anyone else with sensory processing problems? I’m not really sure if I have autism, but I figured this would be a good community to ask about this. I’ve struggled with severe misophonia (hatred of certain sounds) for the majority of life. It’s always been something that’s really hard for me to communicate about (because it doesn’t make sense to other people), and something that seems to come and go unexpectedly. I’ve been having a particularly hard time recently, to the point where it’s effecting my relationships. It’s always been a huge fear of mine to lose people because the sounds of them just trying to live their lives makes me so uncomfortable that I push them away. I am looking into therapy, but along with that, I’m wondering if anyone has any tips for me that have been useful to them or people they know to help with coping with this?

autism,tiresias-felis,2019/03/04,"ABA therapy? I hope this kinda post is okay, since I’m not on the spectrum but I was wondering if anyone could give me some feedback or resources for my question. 

I’ve been looking at part time listings and noticed some openings for ABA therapists/technicians nearby where I live. It seems kind of strange to me that they don’t require a degree or certifications but I’m interested in working with people, so I’m considering applying. 

However, after doing some surface level google searches, I’m getting some mixed feedback on whether ABA is actually helpful to folks or not. If anyone has any additional information they think i should be aware of or experiences they can share, i would really appreciate it!

autism,Normacont,2019/03/04,"How do you get supportive people? One of the things I just thought about is how unforgiving and unaccepting I am of my own personality and being. I'm always way too harsh and down on myself simply for the ""crime"" of being autistic, and the ""crime"" of being so obviously autistic that those around me reject my existence by bullying the hell out of me.

But I realise I'm trying to fit in with psychos whilst not being one myself. I'm harsh on myself because the people around me, including my own family, are also beyond cruel and harsh about me being myself, autistic. I need more accepting and compromising people who are willing to change to suit me as well instead of me just being at fault all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

What i mean is that i understand what people do or what i perceive people to do that causes me to yell at them or to cry and i can avoid the trigger but with this it scares me because i dont know what caused it, i dont know what the trigger was or how to avoid it and it scares me that i did something so childish with little control over it. Now it wasn't that bad i wasn't in public i was at home and it happened when my dad tried to hang up my clothes which he has done before and i have no issues with, this time it was different but i dont know why. im curious if something like this has happened to someone else and what i can do to help circumvent it and manage it.",2.0895386064030106,3.1199685000000024,3.523333333333333,93.15434086629006,75.86440677966101,6.430885122410547,23.704331450094166,6.691623216298621,0.5077286252354045,850,25,199,7,18,280,105,236,0.145,0.797,0.058,-0.9449,2,2,4,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,1,2,8,12,5,4,8,0,28,0,0,7,0,46,39,23,0,3,11,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,31,16,0,3,8,0,0,3,9,11,0,1,12,4,26,1,23,27,1,22,0,0,0,0,8,11,0,7,7,145,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09575217367220927,0.10738294090773888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786707596458286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07378781381961375,0.05387139717421911,0.0,0.07519896514260807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723504285383801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09911790139085573,0.0,0.0,0.0970736568160369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1846620770681312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09043632293049647,0.6214354094564631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07382435191144855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517007975661119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050224446600070964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15629601034022453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05923459934586079,0.09337098998967312,0.0886453847567245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19091613955411946,0.18447702935839333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428376133173377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043174613258230236,0.0885730226336629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07513161542744423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878261699455732,0.09626416987482517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939265771723024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838002579554996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08463696298423708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07027780440861718,0.17695369988532111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748782070223343,0.27213559665927617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10306208401714874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05999950683267654,0.0,0.0,0.0919994721841416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052124720500805286,0.07014642166224552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07974294116984673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10738294090773888,0.05690935326538936

I explain why I don't want to over work myself with my YouTube channel and still explain how important this channel is to me.",6.024857142857139,7.6211717714285765,6.052857142857146,76.60214285714288,67.0,8.457142857142857,41.14285714285714,8.841846274778883,4.079371428571429,304,19,49,5,5,96,43,70,0.019,0.916,0.066,0.4728,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,2,0,13,6,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,10,1,15,5,0,10,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,4,37,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610904206651938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.516145777253545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4267881807432961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3152145248230246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4822305629141034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3890638317425244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,pikachuuuuu,2019/03/04,"Hi, I hope this is okay here. I'm not on the autism spectrum as far as I know but I do have OCD and have always experienced what I think are very similar to the ""special interests"" people with autism often have. I was wondering if someone could maybe give me some input on this? First off I'm so sorry if any of the terms I use are incorrect, I do have a number of friends that have autism/ASD but I admittedly am not super familiar with all the terminology so if I misspeak I'm very very sorry, feel free to correct me.

My whole life I've had various things that I'm very, simply put, hyper obsessed with.  Certain things or people...often people, actors or singers, I have a few of those that are kind of my ""favorite people"" that I'm really super into.

These interests of mine...interests is putting it lightly really.  I have encyclopedic knowledge of certain things or people and I often can't get them out of my head no matter how much I try.  

On the one hand I don't mind that because they do kind of bring me comfort in a way.  Also it's kind of nice having some things be ""my thing"", like a certain show/person/etc. will come up and people will tag me in it on social media or say ""talk to Pika about that, that's her thing"" and that's kind of nice.

It can honestly be very stressful too though.  Often I cannot get them off my mind no matter how much I want to.  Sometimes I get so overwhelmed by them that I can't shut up about them...I try so hard to hold it in but sometimes I just burst and talk about them incessantly, and it drives people crazy.  My friends make fun of me for it, they say ""Your obsession with ______ is weird and unhealthy and we're tired of hearing about it"" and that of course doesn't feel good.  I *know* it's weird and I *know* it's probably not healthy but I really can't help it.  People close to me also get insecure, like my significant other will feel bad because I'll go on about how much I adore my favorite actress or something, and that causes jealousy.  

It's really difficult because I don't like talking with fellow fans of the things I like either.  Something in me gets competitive, I always want to be the biggest/most knowledgeable/oldest fan and I think things like ""You don't understand, you don't love this thing like I do.""  I'd never say that out loud because I hate gatekeeping but I have the thoughts and I don't like it.  

I also get so worried that people judge me, like family members, that they look at me and go ""why does she talk about ______ so much, what is her deal?""  So I get outright scared to even talk about these things sometimes.  I just can't always help myself.

So, although these things do bring me comfort and joy on their own, it's very lonely and stressful that I have these things I love so much but no one to talk to about them, and that I can't get them off my mind sometimes.

A lot of interests will come and go, sometimes I discover something new and fall hard and fast for it and obsess over it for a few weeks and then stop caring.  Sometimes I'll be well aware of something/someone but don't really feel particularly strongly about it either way, then one day it's like a switch flips and I'm full on obsessed with it out of nowhere.  Other things, like my one favorite actress, I've been super fixated and in love with for over a decade.  It'll kind of wax and wane, sometimes I go through periods where it's a long stronger than usual, but it's always there.

I've always thought and assumed this was because I have pretty severe OCD, but I haven't really heard of many other people with OCD dealing with this particular thing.  It's not the typical type of OCD obsession at all.  I've been told by some people that these are really similar to the special interests people on the autism spectrum often have...in fact I have one friend with autism who insists I may have some sort of ASD because of this but I'm not sure, I don't have any of the other major symptoms that I know of, plus I feel at my age (a bit shy of 30) and after being to so many doctors for these types of things it would have come up by now if there was any suspicion I had ASD.  I honestly don't know though.

So I guess my question is what everyone's experience with special interests is, if this sounds familiar at all, if this could be indicative of any sort of ASD by itself or maybe if it is just a strange, uncommon OCD symptom.  Not asking for a diagnosis or anything, just wondering about experiences and maybe some insight.

If I'm way off base and wrong about how special interests work for you guys I'm so sorry, I'm only going by what I've been told and coming in with the hope that someone will actually understand me for once.  It really does bring me a lot of stress and seems so hard for most people to understand, which is one of the worst parts.  I hope this post is okay here because I thought maybe if anyone could relate it might be someone here.

Thank you all ❤

autism,AnimeDreama,2019/03/04,"Living with my autistic sister I am feeling very overwhelmed emotionally right now so I apologize for any errors in spelling or if this ends up becoming a rambling post. It's also going to be very long so again I apologize.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to share some backstory about me to help you better understand why my sister is so important to me. I had a very rocky childhood. I was a very volatile child. I got into fights with other children very frequently. I was a problem child in school, was regularly punished by teachers and administration. I was eventually diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at a young age, which wasn't surprising. My dad died in front of me when I was eight, and after his death my nmom began her abuse of me. My sister was born not long after my dad passed away. I also had severe ADHD and my frequent mood swings did nothing to help my home and school situations. 

My mother hated me, and often singled me out to be the subject of her worst abuse. I have a scar on my chest from where she threw a dinner plate at me when I said I was not hungry one night. It required 17 stitches. My nmom was clever about her abuse. She always made sure that the beatings were never in visible areas, and the two times that CPS got involved she was always a model parent. None of us were ever brave enough to out her. I shielded my sister from the worst of her abuse. She was very rarely a target for her violence but she didn't get away unscathed.

From the day my sister was born I was smitten with her. I took it upon myself to take care of her with the help of my older brother, because our mother did not seem to care. My sister, Claire, quickly became attached to me, which infuriated my mom to no end. 

 My little sister is autistic. She is high functioning but to anyone observant enough it is very obvious that she is neuro-atypical. She has a very specific tic where she will start tapping a surface incessantly. It can last a minute up to several hours. It used to be very annoying but I have become accustomed to it. Our mother never physically abused Claire much, instead opting for emotional or verbal abuse. She would mock her autism and make snide remarks. She would berate her for her tics and neuro-atypical behavior. More than once I shut her down. She often made her (claire) cry. 

I hated her so much. I still do, not just for what she did to me, but most of all, because of what she did to Claire. Claire only ever wanted our mother to love her as a mother should, and being so young, she never understood why she did not. There have been multiple occasions when Claire would come to me and our big brother and ask such painful and difficult questions, and more often than not, tears would be involved.

""Why does mommy hate me?""

""What did I do wrong?""

""Why did mommy hurt me?""

But the one that tore me apart, the one that has kept me up for so many sleepless nights, crying and so angry at my nmom, ""am I bad girl?""

I have had so many rage filled nights. Nights I would cry, and cry and cry for myself and my siblings. But most of all, for my precious little sister Claire, who out of all of us never deserved any of this. A sweet, innocent, little girl who only wanted a mother's love, and never got it.

I made a decision.

I could never take the place of a true parent, but I showered her with so much love. I was still young myself, at only 13, and didn't know much about autism, but I educated myself and how to handle it in young children. I learned about the different types, the spectrum, typical behaviors and how to help guide children suffering autism to productivity. I learned how to deal with the emotional aspect, and the communication difficulties. 

While my sister is high functioning, she has always had severe difficulty communicating with others, including myself, though it was less pronounced with me. She rarely understood humor and would get frustrated trying to figure it out, and had difficulty holding conversations with me, and still does today, although she has gotten somewhat better with time and effort. I began making a concerted effort to help her communication skills and socialization, which was made all the more difficult due to the abuse she suffered at the hands of our mother. My brother, who was several years older than I am, began to seek therapists who could help us further. Progress was very slow, as Claire was (is) very resistant to change. There were many fights and tears, but progress eventually was made. I discovered that Claire has an intense need to collect and sort stuff. I found that she has her desk drawers systematically sorted by sections, and those sections sorted by subsections varying by function. For example, her center draw is exclusively for writing utensils. She has small dividers for her pens, pencils and markers, and has those items sorted by type and color. 

Claire gets very fidgety and emotional when she does not have something to mess with. her emotional imbalance kicks into high gear and she begins to cry, which will eventually lead into a full-blown meltdown. After some time trying to find something that she could do to feed her needs I decided to try getting her into a game that I enjoyed a lot growing up -  Pokémon. She was about six at the time.

I came up to her one day to see her just sitting on the couch doing nothing, staring into space and tapping. I said her name and she turned to look at me, then resumed her tapping. I sat on the couch next to her and began rubbing the back of her head - she always liked it when I did that. We just sat like that for a bit, her tapping and swinging her legs and me sitting next to her and rubbing her head. I was hesitant to bring up the games because she had tried playing games before and ended up in a meltdown because they were so hard for her.

I finally broke the ice.

""I did more thinking about some games you might be able to play.""

She did not reply to that.

""I might have found one.""

""Okay.""

I brought out my old Nintendo DS and Pokémon Diamond. 

""Do you want to try it?""

Claire looked at the game and looked at me, then took it, staring at it. 

""Is it hard?""

""No, it's not hard.""

This was the first time I had let her use my DS. I showed her how to turn it on and access the game. I walked her through the opening few hours of the game. She still remained kind of aloof but made no comment about not wanting to play it. After some time I had her pause it.

""Do you want to keep playing?""

She did not answer.

""Claire, I need you to be honest with me. I don't want to force something on you that you do not want to do.""

She looked at the DS in her hands.

""I... guess.""

I sighed quietly to myself and took the system fom her, and placed it on the table. I adjusted myself and and pulled her over to me, wrapping my arms around her. This always made her feel safe and let her open up more.

""I won't be angry at you. You know you can trust me.""

She mumbled something about knowing. I squeezed her tighter and she buried herself in my arms.

""Please be honest with me. I just want to help you.""

Again, I got silence from her. I wasn't going to pressure her. I let her go and got up.

""I'll let you think about it, okay.""

She mumbled something in reply and I went upstairs. Several hours later she wanted me to help her some more with the game. I am pleased to say she got more into it than she was before and soon became a full on Pokémon fan. It soon became apparent that I was going to have feed this obsession. I bought a secondhand GBA and all the original Pokémon games, and handed off my games to her. She began collecting plushes, figurines, posters, etc. I got her a keychain for her schoolbag and sticker books, the pocket guides, and numerous other odds and ends. Hear favorite thing, though, is the Eeveelution shirt I bought her. She wears it everywhere. To bed, to school, out on the town, EVERYWHERE. Eevee is her favorite Pokémon.

Pokémon has helped my sister so much. She always shows me her teams, what new Pokémon she caught, fan art, whatever. She loves to look up new facts and info regarding the series and sharing that info with me. It can get tiring, I won't lie, but I always smile and engage her. I love the series, too - I grew up on it, after all. But most of all, I love what it has done for Claire.

Growing up with an autistic sister has been the biggest struggle of my life. I love her to death, and I will fight tooth and nail to protect her. It has forced me to grow up prematurely. When I was 18, I got kicked out of my home, and it put a full stop to years of progress. I had to find a new place to live, and during that time I suffered a lot of heartache. I can't imagine how it impacted my sister. My siblings told me horific stories. She regressed hard. Years of progress went down the drain, and along with it her emotional imbalance collapsed in on itself. I spent days and nights crying and wondering what I would do. I used the money I had saved for several years to sue for custody. It was a long, drawn out legal battle, but the courts decided in my favor, and I was reunited with my sister. She moved in with me and my brother, and my girlfriend when I turned 19. We had to undo a year's worth of damage, and it was difficult, painful and sometimes nearly unbearable, but we made it through.

Having an autistic sister has taught me what unconditional love is, and that there are many forms of love, some not immediately apparent. Her form of love is to share what she herself loves. Another one of her love languages is to grip tightly to me and not let go. I learned this one early. When she needs assurance or to be loved on, she would grab me and hold on. She could stay like this for a long time. I don't dislike it. I enjoy the moments we get to spend together, just her and I, hugging and cuddling and just sharing our unique bond. And our bond is very unique. I don't have a relationship with anyone else like I do with her, and I would never change anything about her, no matter what. 

Because autism and all, she is my precious little cinnamon roll, and she is very sweet indeed.",3.896679000590976,5.709083565463921,4.5143660122135385,84.70543601024363,72.62371134020619,7.210716396349071,26.42885284654278,7.910900489728411,1.5597289382099944,7887,273,1515,110,157,2513,628,1940,0.112,0.748,0.141,0.9956,7,0,5,0,10,0,293.0,14,12,1,14,69,88,12,4,78,2,158,35,12,20,22,303,280,136,3,31,38,30,15,4,1,17,5,6,6,8,85,130,3,9,29,21,6,28,36,33,1,11,106,32,315,53,246,138,49,239,0,7,9,15,247,102,0,29,108,1130,400,17,0.027219042923050836,0.22575080481085055,0.0,0.0,0.03271200013182912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0435341175831888,0.15853896928831315,0.02949182163512956,0.033074116424219056,0.03701976513685551,0.028541539776890938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03806437537213582,0.027889126072342528,0.0223989531129098,0.02423071897372827,0.025446130832345985,0.0,0.05114637364461693,0.02092976387657559,0.022726763900565,0.08296237963934648,0.060122588833830336,0.04632280150055319,0.0,0.0,0.048146063066754674,0.02971614520166132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031131333868197858,0.055503256628333934,0.0,0.05758827659258705,0.023446795339437262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08692876376150233,0.0,0.20929188380226554,0.05266209273038778,0.0280616380695014,0.0,0.027626755610544212,0.028249069221457236,0.02843810657661605,0.031195381337104987,0.0,0.07145870366356556,0.02785453116013466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022738017690906817,0.18370655823247914,0.0964319719594355,0.05624909489664063,0.030356427888257057,0.0,0.04924236528703132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02752553188525241,0.0,0.0,0.02981713106589505,0.04975542423425774,0.02315250400549252,0.0,0.059688551292485965,0.0,0.0,0.08532495901636143,0.0,0.0773460467813005,0.0,0.17415644105964526,0.0,0.029984844481773545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09753166437666792,0.08061950913195268,0.055869181466247135,0.0,0.030677839594061913,0.0,0.16419915646668615,0.08627523983207885,0.05460583871385302,0.0,0.08041582326161842,0.0,0.029138548406761826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024193535989485097,0.0,0.028344444625182732,0.04487662245311978,0.022187152859551508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13916657767699495,0.019225614979282445,0.05319139794095276,0.10912252683217898,0.04806982715407457,0.09635198581428236,0.114285703821145,0.0,0.0,0.04628131386198346,0.3193612362257283,0.20604253234172454,0.03633784502093721,0.11038334930502301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05775020630334249,0.0,0.03187861410103665,0.0,0.02892953501240198,0.10004564205830548,0.10091287718100818,0.14695102732118598,0.07886496380302377,0.05789552188394796,0.12771613957374015,0.0,0.0522348115726289,0.0,0.028561806811888118,0.02898739237958765,0.12911029543318808,0.06210392604008775,0.0579259615106854,0.0,0.06044705201898098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02376661839297985,0.08531431972984814,0.05975667080865159,0.0,0.0,0.02606831908187417,0.0,0.0,0.026044948065318055,0.0,0.027362656087767258,0.030491557444428788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02922306565690637,0.0,0.023244913933961588,0.05178308583586538,0.021645675424797263,0.0,0.08264137378042659,0.021690053148304408,0.024779194401387008,0.0,0.18449862546303789,0.0,0.0,0.030595344678701945,0.0,0.027746386485148104,0.0,0.10477274522142653,0.026920329440022657,0.0,0.01926577867658046,0.02901187814707244,0.086948651354478,0.022756338671732903,0.0,0.02845525355099288,0.031159292047928944,0.0,0.0,0.025653625830833998,0.0,0.04093066565289327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03160340674121203,0.018083122652875337,0.03488172729661685,0.05348514294653622,0.0,0.12697314254540654,0.0312842857570789,0.02580047005190053,0.0260089619594338,0.09072407461794676,0.09239971719924543,0.08881950766603447,0.0265890498541958,0.028335983614001706,0.09822347173220962,0.07052554135888905,0.0,0.3144198542841591,0.14449047063390133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0504646509711801,0.09824381034701526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029517890963413763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740206442603791,0.0297597505194135,0.033074116424219056,0.08764085615533977
autism,cheeseandoreos,2019/03/04,"How do I stop feeling like a fraud? In the past twelve months I’ve been diagnosed with autism, “found out” that I’m gay and found out that Aphantasia is a thing which should all be good things to happen. The problem is that it’s taken so long for all of these things to come out (I’m in my 30’s) that I feel like I’m somehow faking it all and I’ll be found out. 
Concerning the autism I’ve been trying to come to terms with myself that I need to stop denying myself the things I need to live more comfortably day to day i.e. wear sunglasses and earplugs/headphones when necessary. The problem being I worry that people will think that I’m just acting autistic because I now want to do those things when I’ve been secretly struggling for so long. Then I start overthinking that maybe I’m just faking it all even though I know full well that I’m not.

autism,endoftheline445,2019/03/05,"21 and suspect to be an HFA As of recent, I'm suspecting that I'm a HFA.  After high school, I couldn't a job because I was the idiot at every single job.  It was hard processing directions, suffered from work anxiety, and I made countless mistakes.  The longest I've held a job was for 3 months and got terminated, afterwards.  About a year ago, I assumed that I sucked at being a working man because of my ADHD.  Today, I've realized that the main reason why I'm so incompetent could be due to something deeper than just ADHD.  Here are some of my quirks (feel free to skip):

&amp;#x200B;

1) I have trouble filling out forms and I can't explain why.  The worst time I've had signing forms was at my local county office for a passport renewal.  However, virtual forms or eDocs are an entirely different story as I tend to breeze through them.

2) I'm terrible at following directions and figuring out what people want me to do.  I seem to struggle on simple tasks and don't understand what people want me to do most of the time.  I don't know how to improve on this.  I remember in my 6th or 7th job, I overheard my supervisor call me a shithead while I was walking into the workplace.  This is a huge issue because it's preventing me from securing a job and accomplishing my goals.  My biggest one is to purchase a car (Yeah, I can drive) and to reconnect with friends.

3) I'm socially awkward.  I get social cues and can empathize (which other HFAs can do as I've just read) but I can barely hold a conversation.  I'm trying my best to improve on that.

4) I stutter a lot and sometimes the wrong word or pronunciation of a word slips out of my mouth.

5) When it comes to eye contact I tend to stare away from the person I'm having a conversation with because I feel like staring into someone's eyes for too long is incredibly awkward.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really contemplating on bringing up the possibility with my therapist.  Should I?  The problem at hand is that I don't have the money or time to find a psychiatrist to perform testing.  Plus, I don't know how my parents will react when I tell them that I legitimately think I might have autism.  Another question: Anyone who had a late diagnosis want to post how much they paid for testing.  I truly believe learning whether or not I'm a HFA will have a huge impact in my life.  I'm currently at a make it or break it point in life as well, but that's a different story.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - 21 yo who is starting to believe he is a HFA. questions: should I tell my therapist?, how much did testing cost for those who had a late diagnosis?

autism,Claudia_Rose,2019/03/05,"Dealing with being away from parents Hey guys,

I’m new to this sub-reddit but really need some support and I’m hoping some people here might understand what I’m going through. 

I’m 21 and have been diagnosed with high functioning autism since I was 7. It mostly gives me lots of anxiety and panic attacks but it is usually controlled by medication. 

2 days ago I moved out of home to a house 1.4 hours away from home. I’m from the country and I’ve moved to the outer suburbs of a big city for uni. For the last 2 years I lived in resident halls at uni and loved it. Had no problems at all with anxiety. 

However. Since I moved out of home (where I stayed for 3 months for summer holidays) I can’t stop crying and panicking. I just miss my parents so much. Thinking about them makes me uncontrollably cry and breakdown. I just want to go home. I moved out with strangers and they’re all nice enough but I just want my parents. Its so debilitating I lost my appetite and have hardly eaten. And I have been crying during my lectures. I’ve booked in with a new GP  to see in 2 days and I’m seeing a uni councillor tomorrow. Has anyone experienced anything like this.

autism,puppetangel,2019/03/05,"Is it problematic for ASD individuals to ""live in a fantasy world""? I have tried to find research on the issue.  Obviously the inability to distinguish between real / fantasy is common, and one of the look-fors when diagnosing ASD.

However, at the age of 14 is it problematic for an individual on the spectrum to truly believe they live in a fantasy world - Lord of the Rings for example.

When the constantly talk about being friends with Frodo, or marrying one of the elves - and their text messages to friend are filled with the same content - has that gone beyond indulging in fantasy, into a problematic obsession?

I have looked for scientific studies but come up empty handed.

autism,IT_ISNT101,2019/03/05,"For those UK based peeps... Questions on PIP Hi Everyone,

Just looking for opinions on applying for PIP. I have a diagnosis of moderate ASD and I am sure a lot of you know what this comes with:

1) Social Anxiety to the max

2) Tones of voice

3) Prioritization of tasks

4) Forgetting to turn up to places/wrong place/wrong day.

&amp;#x200B;

I am however able to wash myself and cook dinner (just about, although Just Eat makes it sooooo easy, if unhealthy) and my writing skills are far superior to my F2F skills.

I feel that I should qualify because I have major stress around task prioritization, understanding sub-texts and ""playing the blame game"" in work and every single issue my boss has with me is related to communication and interaction. I don't like change.

I am a creature of extreme routine  and any variance (unexpected) send me off on one. I don't scream and shout but get distressed about it and frequently have problems making myself understood. I frequently book things that I need to attend and turn up a day early, or a day short.

Ruminating for days about something coming up, to the point of either cancelling it or just not turning up (sometimes done accidentally) is part of the course.

I am also hyper private. To such a degree a mental health nurse I know said that I present like a person with a mental illness because of my obsession with privacy and trackers (ie phones and smartwatches) 

However,  I can't see how these issues relate to getting PIP. I mean,  I can tick a few boxes but not all of them. It seems very stanced against aspies. What are your thoughts. Should I go for it?

Oh and the binary trust/no trust in people is strong in me ;)",5.920324605726536,7.100903032154343,6.387000459347727,75.64834941050377,66.90996784565917,9.267860970754864,31.851324452610626,9.48565724429506,2.9372295513703865,1317,53,237,26,21,427,190,311,0.083,0.851,0.066,-0.6299,2,0,1,0,0,0,51.0,0,2,1,4,11,12,0,3,15,0,20,6,0,4,2,55,42,21,0,5,12,0,1,2,0,2,3,4,0,1,14,20,3,0,9,4,0,5,5,5,0,1,4,7,30,7,44,36,7,28,0,0,2,0,13,15,0,7,10,158,44,4,0.11555686956948598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09241078684517087,0.0,0.12520581989938792,0.1404142448565967,0.078582633921155,0.0,0.0884006889275958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287011339589552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14088479025894568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224384571041293,0.1990840220592222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29809848436407405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11825479805775953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11824352637369827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09736164653920908,0.11041954095449667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0584290253497702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12074738983230293,0.0,0.06567363198544313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12283154866952925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2412226984265825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12701406688434194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11291049893741748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09703866669707807,0.0,0.0,0.09824231815521572,0.0,0.0,0.15427021550285958,0.0,0.0,0.12587530761831267,0.0,0.0,0.2329082905205108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856839545699962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830432545557423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12513682880901988,0.0,0.08011258339268551,0.10089980127183293,0.12073233367416387,0.0,0.10923859302426844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11057231788187566,0.0,0.0,0.12945014034980684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10992104521744683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208386384854192,0.10519863404356143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11779567610636005,0.0,0.08896132379244097,0.11428869878572555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323700036659384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891098200986307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767708494275418,0.0,0.0,0.09173924661058436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3770780733035232,0.0,0.12029877655372295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09534651948922844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412677732225995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25268659290587986,0.1404142448565967,0.0
autism,zcxtream,2019/03/06,"Will i still get a full time job? I am desperate for one! I am a 23 year old male living to autism, I've been in recent hunt of a full time job because I have been working at a grocery store for 4 and a half years and I am pretty much getting sick of it now. I want to get a full time job where I can grow in one day be team leader, not working at retail, fast food or restaurants. Every time I apply for jobs a lot of times, they're not interested in me or looking at my applicationbor resume, but when certain places are interested in me, I do go in for an interview, but unfortunately after the interview, they would email me a few days later saying that they found a better candidate and don't wanna hire me. Does this mean I'm losing hope? What should I do now.....I am trying to strive for a full time job and not work at a grocery store for the rest of my life, and I am not interested in going to college or pursue a Bachelor's Degree, but I have an Associates Degree! I am from Massachusetts btw!

autism,captainironheart,2019/03/06,"The show Jeopardy has helped me cope with negative feelings around my autism. Today's news that Alex Trebek is dying is very sad for me. Hey r/autism,

30 minutes ago, Alex Trebek, host of the 50-year-running trivia gameshow Jeopardy, announced that he has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. This led me to think back on how much he has helped me (25, m, not diagnosed until age 20) feel better when my autism made me feel stupid. Which, as I bet you can relate to, is often.

I've been watching Jeopardy, either for myself or as a ritual with my dad, for as long as I remember TV. Feelings of being mentally r-word (word I will never say, but rhymes with kickstarted) are some of my most common and pervasive depressive thoughts. And Jeopardy has always been a reliable remedy.

No, I won't know 3/4 of the answers (unless there's mythology, wordplay, or one of my special interests involved in which case I mostly sweep the category) but it's engaging. And helpful to combat that self-loathing for the atypical brain I was born with and will do what I can to make the best of my whole life through.

And it's so funny when in the last several years they've throw in categories like video games, rap lyrics, or even just memes deliberately to create viral clips out of and stay relevant to younger audiences. And there's Trebek, calm and measured, smiling through it all. Even when it's viral clip time, he's always enthusiastic, amused, and never in the least bit jaded as he literally has to play the role of ""spicy memelord grampa, hello fellow kids!""

The will be a Jeopardy without Alex Trebek, and I'm sure they'll choose someone great, but it won't be the same.

I wanted to share these thoughts here because they specifically relate to my autism. Does anyone else have a similar experience with Jeopardy, or maybe another show? I'd love to hear your thoughts!",6.388315047021942,7.182933531609192,6.414148380355277,77.25023510971788,65.69540229885058,9.430721003134797,32.19749216300941,9.457814108942452,2.905403448275864,1471,57,265,27,22,467,209,348,0.104,0.725,0.172,0.9858,0,0,0,0,0,0,56.0,0,2,2,2,14,16,1,0,15,0,25,5,1,4,4,58,40,29,1,1,12,1,4,1,1,6,3,2,1,1,13,17,0,0,12,8,1,2,8,3,0,1,7,7,25,13,44,24,11,27,1,2,1,1,23,7,0,9,17,167,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11524985681130498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21636467160557504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13633135865794302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090904084913573,0.13321504301963388,0.0,0.11574031621173513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09997299262718012,0.0,0.07925552736216268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13644201558091906,0.11498710726945717,0.14194197233533093,0.0,0.0,0.14513898793334756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198114985929168,0.13196180574483074,0.13493434544487154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11377641424327335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10861028764466142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717464743851667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12717896019681774,0.0,0.0,0.2629566021338016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14334125518176585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14653559637084465,0.0,0.261437589639274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07145247428646638,0.10597902978392212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09183296457194824,0.06351843319326457,0.0,0.0,0.11505858862323493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173430067669724,0.12302270040023375,0.08678557325798528,0.0,0.1306168671983872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13102386253544346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09557549043417993,0.0,0.20055012916495665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08810107318630007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14728088840454087,0.0,0.0,0.1033926117090839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356332987692739,0.14687918309313006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101607178721613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13857797427633806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12253696511678093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833079313845213,0.0,0.3096505601448778,0.07581239997736372,0.0,0.12323838039870195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10727543648077648,0.07668581897990356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14515635369810514,0.0,0.1253291722446775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16744992858832156
autism,crumbycanadianpoutin,2019/03/06,"ASD parents have any experience with government in Canada? So my son received his diagnosis on January 11th, 2019 and they immediately sent the paperwork to the CRA to get back pay for my son on our taxes, etc. I'm asking because after his diagnosis I immediately started making 2 trips per week into the city for therapy sessions for him, I'm a university student and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Completely broke trying to do the best by my son and I'm thinking I might have to drop out just to work to afford to drive the 2 hours twice per week for his therapy... Just feeling overwhelmed and looking for strength.",6.975850931677022,7.604896721739133,7.952795031055902,67.30608695652174,64.3913043478261,10.745341614906833,38.16770186335404,10.608840637214634,4.350465838509317,493,25,83,12,7,167,73,115,0.057,0.833,0.11,0.6378,2,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,1,3,4,5,0,2,6,0,4,0,0,1,0,14,17,5,0,0,2,4,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,3,0,2,4,0,3,0,1,1,3,11,2,20,15,2,16,0,3,1,0,13,5,0,1,6,52,11,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14438615753220335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1984922941224388,0.0,0.0,0.1632624179555641,0.0,0.12942944582787394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22281871122476887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2226154489733666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23679501817396756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2076915375759376,0.0,0.0,0.21471264165234094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11092941773510494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2090942803591596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782969024746245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14172650194234834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2252399590868911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2357583183714174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15028251771418946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4856171419288152,0.0,0.0,0.13604728592485274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14415261765320325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406236061558499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15457285556648198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,you_best_not_miss,2019/03/06,"Waiting for autism diagnosis. What do I do now? My daughter is 18 months old and our pediatrician has referred us to a developmental pediatrician who is going to assess our daughter. The wait time is 2 months and I'm a nervous wreck already. I still have no clue what autism spectrum is and how she will grow up. Right now she doesn't respond to her name or follow instructions/directions but otherwise a gentle and playful child who loves colors, rhymes and music.  I read a statistic somewhere that 60 percent of autistic children need life long support from a caretaker. I don't even know if that is a correct statistic or not.

autism,jointstool,2019/03/06,"Where do I go from here? Hi friends, 

&amp;#x200B;

First post on r/autism, and one of my first ever on reddit so bare with me please. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a question primarily for those working with children on the spectrum in a professional manner, but I encourage anyone to chime in if they think they can help. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me. I graduated high school in 2012. In 2017 I graduated from University with an arts degree. I returned home to my parents house a year later, and fully intended to move out after 3 months and pursue my art. When some moving logistics fell through I found my summer job ending and needed a new source of income. After some horrid interviews in retail and a lot of afternoon wasted I came across a job listing  to provide respite care for children on the autism spectrum and their families. I had work experience in the past (namely summer camp, and one-on-one babysitting) with children with autism as well as a few other developmental disabilitis. I did not have any formal training in this work but found that it came very naturally to me. I enjoyed the kids I had worked with in the past and built strong and unique relationships with each one of them. To make a long story short I got hired to begin respite care and more or less thrown into it without much advising from higher ups. I was placed with two families with non-verble kiddos between the ages of 5-10) I have developed a very strong passion for the work over the last 5 months. I mostly play with the kids in leisurely settings, (parks, walks, swim lessons, etc.) I'm not tasked with teaching the kids or working on any type of therapy, but I do my best to integrate some of what I imagine they're practicing into our play time (i.e counting, colors, new words, etc). I love going into the families houses instead of an office like some of my fellow 25 year olds. I love the smiles and laughs of the children, and the parents are always so caring and thankful for my time. The feeling I have after leaving work is something that feels new to me. I work with the kids and their families after school M-F. The hours are slim but will pick up in the summer and they pay me decently (15-$16 an hour). I'm beginning to think I've discovered a new direction in life but don't know where to move from here. Does anyone have any advice they could lend me? Have you found yourself in my shoes? If so, what is your story? I'd love to hear any ideas for ways to progress in this area after receiving my degree in something unrelated. I would be willing to pursue more school if necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all suggestions welcome! And thank you in advance!

autism,CaptainQuadmay,2019/03/06,"Ambulance work with autism Sharing some experiences, because I think they might be helpful.   


I recently started doing ambulance work, and it's interesting to see how good of a fit it is for me! Turns out, there are a surprising amount of other ASD individuals in emergency medicine, and many of the traits that I have as a result of the disorder have been useful. One medic complimented me on my, ""poker-face,"" for example, because being over-expressive with patients is generally a big no-no. I've also got a naturally good memory for things that I care about, (which is apparently pretty common here) so I'm pretty far along with memorizing the field-pharmacology book, and I know where everything is on the ambulance at all times. 

  
There are issues, though. The bright lights and sirens can be disorienting, although the ambulance actually mutes it very well, and you'll rarely see the lights anyways. The main thing that gets me is when the tones drop at the station for an emergency; They're meant to wake people up, so they're quite loud and jarring. Plus, if your dept. is a mixed fire and EMS, you'll probably get some fire calls, which can be really fun but also horrible if that's a trigger for you.   


As for the stuff you may see, I'll be honest: I haven't gotten a whole ton of real emergencies yet. But, on the ones that I have been on, I was surprised by how easy it was to ignore the bad stuff. It hurts to watch people hurt, obviously, and it hurts even more because I feel like I don't really know how to express it to my non-spectrum partners. But, actually being able to help make them feel better makes up for it, because it feels really cool to make things better, even if they don't have a great final outcome.   


Overall, If you want to help people and you're looking for a career with a fairly low entry barrier, I'd say check it out! Most places have ride-alongs for adults, and long-term cadet programs for minors. Like I said, you'll probably meet some autistic brethren there, and a lot of the traits of the common traits of the disorder  are not only not detrimental, but seriously helpful!",9.983380158033365,7.403492298507468,9.600512145156577,68.34965320456543,60.09452736318408,13.140415569212761,38.074919520046834,11.557038098267885,4.185007140766754,1672,58,313,37,17,544,213,402,0.112,0.721,0.16699999999999998,0.952,1,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,0,7,3,5,20,25,0,0,29,1,35,2,1,9,2,60,60,32,0,5,10,0,5,2,1,5,1,3,0,2,23,19,0,2,8,1,1,0,5,7,1,2,8,17,26,18,48,41,11,26,0,4,6,0,22,17,0,11,10,211,49,6,0.09227874312567512,0.0,0.18010148384386274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14759055507642158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07704889602426336,0.2250090612363357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16322609868428226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422691411331123,0.0,0.09408432867246426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21151886855480487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189847906590925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08293418415365122,0.09026631767944368,0.0,0.0,0.1399767155710167,0.06592395252714703,0.0,0.10108685254484763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964236692369963,0.0,0.0,0.15479806319700568,0.07380374070121548,0.10173764006863796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2474099854588708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29635890921118885,0.0,0.0,0.09631503305307053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10142796784850328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09016546542369364,0.0,0.0,0.08166378382352289,0.07749090323023282,0.0,0.0,0.0784520874863669,0.0,0.0,0.1847903327777156,0.09355616180798644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09296112548296266,0.0,0.0978931637674859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125060929069201,0.07018214238649705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19192338451802365,0.0,0.09641164603703817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18776131313160868,0.1989841851942926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09814980212916642,0.0,0.10503341206490856,0.1773483773357094,0.0,0.09111412624608406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08777821633206448,0.07338376033108235,0.0,0.0,0.2206026327060456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531536934043716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112741667660698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.183917689712184,0.05912849254259477,0.09066339659620612,0.0,0.0538084772025758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10037277401258783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07969920584955249,0.0,0.07613962729046629,0.054428393555316174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08296967230151339,0.0,0.0,0.10302592123591447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13436004806003554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,BenchPebble,2019/03/06,"Is it okay to explain my behavior by saying I have autism? I was diagnosed with ASD when I was 11 and I've always had issues with getting really worked up and emotional about things which probably aren't as significant as I think they are. 

Today, long story short, I had a really stressful class where I thought I had fucked myself over on an assignment at the beginning of class and found out at the end that my professor was only joking when she said I ""kinda threw [myself] under the bus."" Afterwards, I pretty upset (but kept my composure) and I went to the campus bookstore to get something to eat while processing everything. 

When the cashier asked me ""how is your day going?"" I told her (I know it's just a pleasantry, but I like to answer sometimes) and I said ""not too good, I just spent the past hour thinking I completely fucked myself over"" and I elaborated a bit, but I suddenly got really emotional again and had to stop. She looked at me really weird and I kind of just walked off. 

Here's my question: is it okay to explain my behavior by saying I have autism? On the one hand, I feel like it would be beneficial sometimes because people won't just think ""oh, he's weird"" and then not talk to me. On the other hand, I don't want people to think I'm using my diagnosis as a crutch, since I don't ""look autistic."" Does anyone have any advice?

autism,stetja,2019/03/07,"Self Acceptance I'm 25 and I was diagnosed with high functioning autism in May of 2015. I was already diagnosed with epilepsy the August before so this was a little hard to take on. For some reason, however, epilepsy was a lot easier to accept than autism. Unlike epilepsy, I was very ashamed when I found out I have autism. Even though autism, mental illness in general, runs in my family, it was unacceptable for me to have autism. So I forced myself to forget. Fast forward to the present. I applied for disability employment services because of my epilepsy. My mom used the letter that the doctor who diagnosed me wrote for something back in 2016 that helped me get approved for services. Of course memory comes back. I was okay, though, because my girlfriend of one year has autism and anxiety, so loving someone romantically with autism makes you think differently about it. She made me realize that there is nothing wrong with being autistic. I have been able to embrace my disorder and just seize the day.

No he did not start speaking speech level 100 english. My aunt(His mammy) took him to the doctors and they discovered that he was simply tongue tied! I suspected as much back when I was basically a doctor because I read a few text books when I was in highschool. But I knew I was not a doctor so I didnt say anything. But Im just glad that he will be able to say a few words once he heals up. He is incredibly smart for not being able to verbally communicate.

autism,lilpix101,2019/03/07,"I think I might have autism I am a 23 year old female and I have wondered for almost my whole life if I have autism. My mum always makes fun of me saying she thinks I do, but for some reason never got me checked as a kid. The reason I think it is because lots of people my whole life have said I might due to my behaviours, and because I have researched it a bit and a lot of things match with me. I won’t describe much in this text but basically one of the main things is I always feel myself getting super agitated when things don’t go as planned, even tiny details. And a lot of the time my irritation quickly grows to huge anger and then to meltdowns, within minutes. To the point if me screaming on the floor and pulling out my hair and banging my head against the ground. I am scared because my huge reactions to small things are really upsetting my partner. Like a tiny argument will completely blow me up and I can’t get a grasp of my emotions I just have a meltdown. It hurts me that it hurts her. I have seen a doctor and she has booked me in for a psychiatric assessment but its not for another two months. I was wondering if anyone here might be able to help me out, just from what I have described. Maybe if anyone has, or knows anyone who has, these types of behaviours in common? Thanks in advance

autism,BillyJeanisme,2019/03/07,"Please help me with my brother. So my brother Kyle who is 26 is a low functioning autistic. He doesn't speak. He can sit on the toilet to poo but wears diapers to pee. He is  Obese. He is tall and strong. Once every couple of weeks he'll have these tantrums that are really scary. He bites his fingers and hits himself and hits the wall and bangs his head against the wall. If you try to stop him hell swat at you. It hurts. He lives with me his 24 year old sister and our mom and dad wjo are in their 50s. I hate saying this but he is a constant source of stress in my life. We can't take him to the doctors or dentist cause he will throw a tantrum most likely.  I need advice on how to help him lose weight. And what to do when he has these tantrums? Like we currently will ait with him and watch t.v. and he'll se to calm somewhat. I was wondering if the following would help 

Weighted blanket ?

Turning his room in to a padded room and locking him in there when these tantrums strike ?

Forcing boxing gloves on him do that he can't hurt himself as bad when he trys to hit the wall?

Please please help me. 

Later I'll upload a video of one of his tantrums.

autism,UNUCU,2019/03/08,"Unwanted autistic child, soon to be adult Looking for advice. I’m a caregiver to an autistic teen, soon to be 18. He’s pretty independent in terms of self care, but would not be able to live alone or in a group home with higher functioning people on the spectrum. He does not have a proper sense of safety— with people or objects. The parents are done caring for him. They are wealthy, but not interested in funding $50,000-$100,000 annually for a residential facility. Anyone aware of his options? He isn’t eligible for any government funded services due to his parents income.

Any tips on other body language that can help communicate that you're paying attention to a customer when it's really hard to look someone in the eye constantly? I've been told that I come across nervous/distracted sometimes and while I can probably explain to my boss at this place and not have to worry about getting in trouble, I'd still like to make the customers as happy as I can.

autism,teckmonkey,2019/03/09,"My 3 year old daughter may have ASD and I am feeling a ton of anger and guilt. My daughter's preschool teacher had been noticing that she was falling behind verbally and socially.  I took her to her a speech therapist last week and found out that she was communicating almost exclusively with echolalia.  The speech therapist told me that she has a lot of autism red flags, but they can't be confirmed yet until she sees a behavioral therapist (appointment was made already).

I am feeling terrible about the times I was short with her because I thought she was messing with me.  I feel especially bad because I have ADHD and I know what it's like to be mischaracterized based on my neuroatypically functional brain.  

All of my feelings came to a head this afternoon.  My daughter was at a playground with kids her own age.  She kept repeating ""okay!"" when she would try to interact with the other kids.  They asked her why she kept repeating herself, and laughed at her when she would reply to her questions with an ""okay!"".  I packed her up a few minutes later and aimlessly drove around.  

I was so angry, but not at the other children.  I was angry at how unfair it was that my daughter would have to work harder than every other neurotypical person to have a normal life.  Then I thought about how much this would affect my life and my wife's life and got angry about that. Then incredibly guilty for being selfish.

I imagine feeling like this is normal, especially when it feels like your kid is being attacked.  Is it?  Or am I making a mountain out of a molehill?  

If you've felt this way as a caregiver, what tips have you used to work through feeling like crap about your kid's situation?

autism,Renzolom,2019/03/09,"Autism &amp; The Ability to Feel  (My contribution to this subreddit, from my official blog, [Autistic Spirits](https://www.autisticspirits.com/blog))  


A lot of neurotypicals(""normal people"") think having autism means you don't have feelings. This is one of the most common stereotypes about autistic people and it's far from the truth. Someone on the spectrum does feel, but he/she expresses it in a different way than most people do. In this article, I'm going to clear things up about the relationship between autism and the ability to feel. Someone has to do it and because I'm autistic myself, I think I'm the perfect candidate for this job.  


**Empathy &amp; Sympathy**  
There's a lot of information about this subject available on the internet, but most of it is difficult to understand. You don't have to worry about that though, because I'm going to explain how autistic people feel as simple as possible.  


So let's begin. A lot of people think autistic people are unsympathetic and unempathetic, which isn't true. Someone with autism has the ability to feel empathy and sympathy, it's just that he/she lacks the social communication skills to express them. Don't get me wrong, not everyone on the spectrum is very bad at social interactions, but most of them are at some degree.  


The term ""social communication"" is a bit wide, so let's get deeper into that. Social communication means, in this case, reading other people's faces and their body language. An autistic person has problems with discovering if there's something wrong with, for example, their friend. Luckily, reading others is a skill which can be taught.  


You can see me as the living proof of that. I used to have a hard time reading others, but after some years of life experience, I've gotten a lot better at it. I'm not saying I'm now some kind of social expert, but I've made a lot of progress.  


**Autism &amp; Love**  
Some people think autistic people don't have the ability to love, which is not true at all. I admit that asexuality is more common among people with autism than neurotypicals. On the other side, those on the spectrum who aren't asexual, or something like that, usually love more intensely than normal people.  


You're probably wondering ""why is that?"" and luckily for you, I got the answer. Autistic people think in black and white, which means they really love someone, or they don't. There are a few exceptions, like always, but this is usually how an autistic brain works.  


This ""it's one, or the other"" way of thinking is also the reason why obsessive behavior is more common among those on the spectrum than among neurotypicals. On the bright side, it's also the reason why most autistic people are really good at things they love doing.  


**Autism &amp; Anger**  
Autistic people do feel anger and I know all about it. I'm pretty good at controlling my anger, but sometimes I have a meltdown. Don't get me wrong, I don't start screaming randomly while attacking everything I can reach, but I do become angry, annoyed and stressed.  


Some people on the spectrum have more extreme meltdowns than me and some don't even have meltdowns, so let's take me as the average. We react this way not because we want attention or something like that, our meltdown is just our body telling ourselves and the people around us it's being overwhelmed.  


This overstimulation can have a few causes like being in a situation which requires a lot of social interaction. By doing those kinds of things, autistic people are getting so stressed they eventually have a meltdown, to get it all out.  


**Conclusion**  
It's a lot of information I gave you in this article and I thought it would be useful to summarize everything you've just read. So let's begin with that.  


Autistic people do feel, they just express it in a different way than neurotypicals do. People on the spectrum also have the ability to be sympathetic and empathetic, factors like having problems with reading others are the reason why it sometimes looks like someone with autism lacks those two abilities. Therefore, it's important to always try to understand why an autistic person behaves as he/she does.  


Just like every feeling, autistic people also have the ability to fall in love and to get angry. When someone on the spectrum falls in love, he/she usually loves very intensely. When someone on the spectrum gets angry, it usually results in a meltdown. How extreme the meltdown is, depends on how angry the autistic person is and how much he/she is able to control it.  


So in short, autistic people do feel. It's just that their brain works in a different way, a unique one. I personally think this is a good thing, but I also acknowledge the cons of having ""a different operating system"". It's the job of everyone on the spectrum to use their autism to thrive, which is more than possible.

autism,Marriedtothearmy,2019/03/09,"Am I being too hard on myself with this new job? Ok so I just started a new job two days ago. I unknowingly went through a temp agency; I found the job on indeed. It’s a M-F job with weekends off. I was unemployed for 10 months before I found this job. It’s working with elementary students who have autism and behavior issues. It’s a little out of what I was looking for because the at risk youth population is really where my passion is and I’ve never worked with children who have autism or other disabilities. I was just so happy to finally have a job that I accepted it and thought I’d try this population of students. Well it’s only been two days and so far I am not impressed with the training. I feel like I’ve just been thrown in and expected to know what each child requires right off the bat. The first day I spent 3/4 of the day observing and then the next day, I took more of the lead with the child and had someone shadow me. I just felt so incompetent because I didn’t do or give the right prompt and just felt stupid for not knowing how to respond appropriately based upon the child’s behavior. I was only given a binder to read what each child has issues with and that was it on the first day. I just feel like I’m not picking up on things as quickly as I should. But I keep telling myself that it’s only been two days and to give myself more time. I just hate looking incompetent when I’m a fairly intelligent person. Aside from this, since I’m a temp, I don’t get a school email account, therefore I don’t get access to the emails and calendars, so I feel even more out of the loop. I don’t get a ID badge and have to submit my time sheets to this temp agency. So I feel even more out of place. I’m just frustrated with the whole process and what I’ve seen so far.

autism,Mauhg,2019/03/10,"In need of advice and I don’t know what to do. If you’re reading this, thank you. It means a lot to me. I’ve been lost for a couple years now and it’s not getting any better.

My son’s birthday is 9/18/14. He’s 4 now. He’s never said any word other than grunts, screams, or excited EEEEEEEE. He’s extremely affectionate and ridiculously smart. He’s taught himself how to play complicated games on my iPad that are on par with GTA. (Please don’t judge me)

We have a small farm. He doesn’t understand the concept of petting animals. He doesn’t understand the concept of potty training. There is no way of teaching him any simple task, unless he teaches himself. 

I’ve never heard “mama” or “dada.” I’ve never witnessed him doing anything for himself, other than grabbing his snacks or shoving his sippy cup in my face when it’s empty. When he’s upset, he can’t communicate it and he kicks and grabs me. I’m 5ft tall &amp; petite. He was a 9lb emergency c-section. He’s a tall, strong boy. I have a lot of bruises and hair ripped out. I think you get the idea.

We live in Southern Louisiana, very near the Gulf. I don’t know what to do anymore.

autism,alkakfnxcpoem,2019/03/10,"I figure you guys will give me better advice than google on helping my son. We're in process of getting my five year old son evaluated but I'm like 98.5% sure he's autistic, would have been diagnosed Asperger's prior to the DSM-V. He's always been very high energy and all over the place but very smart and hit all his milestones so we didn't realize until he started getting really obsessed with Pokemon and time. Now it's pretty clear that his little quirks were autistic behaviors the whole time. He stims like 24/7 unless he's playing video games. He repeats things constantly. He doesn't really get social situations. 

But anyway I digress. I came here to ask for help. What works best for helping you with day to day life and understanding social situations? Is there something I can tell him to help him understand he sees the world differently and needs to explain that to other people sometimes? Like if he's having trouble with something he has to tell me rather than shut down? Also - any tips for discipline? My husband gets him to listen better but he's so firm it causes our son to freak out sometimes if he can't do exactly the right thing. Like my husband's presence can overwhelm his system and prevent him from being able to think things through. 

TL;DR - momma figuring out son likely has high-functioning autism looking for tips for helping my son from the people who have lived it. Thanks.

autism,StonedHedgehog,2019/03/10,"Mild autism, or am I just overthinking to put a nametag on my weirdness? Hi there.
Since a couple years I am starting to think more and more that I might have some form of mild autism, but I never got diagnosed.
I told 2 therapists my thoughts and one told me that I don't need to look for an explanation, that all people are different in a way, the other told me that I can't have autism because I have overflowing empathy to the point that I cried about some homeless guy's life, that I met while waiting for the bus.

I learned to be really good at socializing and even know how to go about meeting new people, which I enjoy.
It feels like a acquired mental skill that was hard to learn, not something I knew how to do.

So these are pretty atypical for autism, right?

But as a kid I was always a bit weird, a silent book worm, daydreamer. I hung out with the girls in recess because I didn't get along with the guys needing to prove how strong they are.
I obsessed over random things, like reading the manual of a game 50 times, in general I read a lot of books in double digits just to go back to the fantasy world of that story.

School was easy for me, which fucked me later since I never learned how to stay motivated when actually challenged.

Romantic relationships are a nightmare, I am like the guy in beautiful mind and can't build sexual tension at all, I surprised women a few times by just straight up doing a confession monologue, because all other forms of showing interest in more than just friendship feel wrong, and creepy. Doesn't help that I have been called a creep multiple times when I did suck it up and try to make a move.

I hide behind excuses, like I don't want to be a dick to another guy by getting with this girl, and generally care much more about others than myself.

I have a talent for music and improvisation which was sadly never nurtured, I am slowly trying to get to a level where I might be able to live as an artist.

autism,caroline2211,2019/03/10,"My Brother Will Never Understand, And It's Super Sad Me and my older brother are on the Autism Spectrum, with me being high functioning and him being low functioning. High functioning basically means that I am much better at communicating and I can have a fully independent adulthood, unlike my low functioning counterparts. My brother can have a sort of independent adulthood, but he is probably going to need support for the rest of his life. But this is only part of the story.
Up until my brother reached his high school years, as far as I could remember, he didn't seem to realize or mind that he was little different from the rest of his peers. When he was in ninth grade I remembered saying he wanted friends, and I mean ""normal"" friends and not friends diagnosed with autism. And since my brother repeated eighth grade to prepare for high school, I guess at some point he realized that he wasn't going to graduate with the same class he started school with. And for a while now, he has been doubting that he even has Autism! Most of the time he keeps saying ""I don't have autism"" even if me or my parents didn't bring up the subject. I know my brother is just running away from his problem instead fully accepting he has autism and not letting it become an obstacle, but it's not easy for him to do that.
You see, he also has an intellectual disability, which means he will never the ability to understand complex concepts, like that he can't get rid of his autism and he has to deal with. He actually did tell me that he believes he can get rid of autism. And what's sad is that I know running away from your problems does more harm than good, and I worry his obsession might lead to self-harm or suicide later in his life.
I don't need any help, that's what our psychologist is for (and I did talk to her about this), I just felt I needed to share this story. And I am also wondering if there is anyone else in a similar situation.",8.941811764705884,7.0044940800000015,8.777741176470588,71.41969411764707,61.53333333333333,12.130196078431375,38.058823529411775,10.843485225782073,3.950515294117648,1540,60,291,31,17,501,176,375,0.122,0.779,0.099,-0.8514,2,0,0,0,0,1,38.0,1,2,0,3,11,19,0,2,14,0,39,3,0,3,2,70,63,29,1,10,13,7,1,1,3,3,3,2,0,0,18,19,0,1,16,0,0,6,11,9,0,0,9,4,40,10,45,47,8,37,0,4,1,0,49,19,0,13,13,202,58,8,0.0,0.0,0.08971792836783361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14704508331086044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06252078543105125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428497415935898,0.09420103345240033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17275698213589946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10153796119838134,0.0,0.1035822992802215,0.0,0.081311420189148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07340476859898673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09478372680654663,0.0,0.0933148253803125,0.0,0.09605532356940297,0.0,0.0,0.08045529664878086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680214717328618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214479612224004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827460517211387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2130925058090629,0.0,0.09606730233348168,0.0,0.10450062180301542,0.0771129768005051,0.0,0.0,0.1012797364379844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06162389914602062,0.3885488909406991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08171844779809942,0.0,0.0,0.10105310583466402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940125223372088,0.1298766261164694,0.044916113934676975,0.0921457235148237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30044130767752825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09753136584045076,0.09283086368663504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06758478447732663,0.2045119082135726,0.14181603667362766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09007942109971774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06992276008999031,0.0,0.0,0.10208593045491457,0.09955956466591204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691083887710742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912438527752658,0.1759439157471583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20829497301518074,0.0,0.0,0.14622509070395248,0.0,0.27913756766163145,0.07326243988096917,0.08369662479468745,0.09591106698618616,0.0,0.0,0.07605181154822599,0.10334182147156963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06507397388112772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10056491648462837,0.10432980703059418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07389603688402896,0.08035759794478864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05360960942918307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19142076617283094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05422723466737851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0997025086722371,0.0,0.09336719226313316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059204861429296984
autism,justAghostInside,2019/03/10,"Consistency of social skills with autism? To my understanding, autism is a persistent way of thinking/behaving present from birth that doesn’t “go away” and is present 24/7. 

Any of you feel as though some days you socialize better than others? Any days where you can pick up on social cues/facial expressions easily, but others it’s hard to care enough to pay attention to any of it? 

Or is it just consistently absent unless you’ve had plenty of practice and learn to apply them effectively?

autism,woodntstock,2019/03/11,"Group project I want to ask this whether it's going too far or not.

  


I'm working in a group project with 11 other people in order to make a commercial. It's a 3d animation college major. One of the people in our group has autism. I've been sitting next to him long enough to know that he doesnt pay attention to lectures, or does much of his work in-person-- watching cartoons or submitting to cartoon-related forums. He's slower than someone else would be, claiming that his autism had a learning disabilit(actual words from his mouth), but gets the work done, but more mediocrely.

I worked with him before on another group project, where expectations for his work were lower than the expectations set for me, or anyone else in the class-- which is messed up since I'm also on spectrum, but i dont have as many symptoms (originally aspergers diagnosis). When I told him, in a calm manner, to pull his weight, he ""told on me"" to our professor and said that I ""stressed him out""\*

  


\*i worked 20 hour shifts at a part time job during this time

  


I ended up disbanding the group since I found it stress-inducing to have to depend on someone to do his role, and not just do it myself while letting his name be on the project.

\---

  


For this group project, he's our only animator. Due to my experience with him on the previous group project, I suggested ""babysitting"" him, since he'll knowingly change from cartoons, to the Google homepage for when a professor passes by, and as a semi inventive for him to get his role done , since it needs to be passed on to the next ""department"" in order to progress in our project.

Some people in the group also agreed, but they're very harsh towards people who are on the autistic spectrum. My question is: is this harsh towards him, and if so, what can be done to not be as harsh, but still have him get the work done? He's very childlike and reacts negatively to the concept of ""get in trouble,"" but doesnt care for respecting the rules (at least in terms of putting his feet up on the table, despite people telling him otherwise)

  


Here are some other things to note:

  


\- for the past few weeks, he's only been either in meetings, loudly interrupting-- or watching cartoons at his desk

\- I send emails to the group of what we went over in the meeting

\- he spent a meeting drawing caricatures of everyone instead of paying attention , then when I asked what he learned from the meeting, repeated basic information we had from last week

  


  


Tldr: is it harsh to babysit him, sitting over his shoulder so he does his job for the group project? If so, what can be done instead so he gets his job done and done on time?",8.55258982035928,7.181462485029942,7.931289920159682,75.37980913173656,61.874251497006,10.984730538922157,38.240269461077844,9.827888789773867,3.5639826347305394,2079,87,395,33,24,653,227,501,0.067,0.91,0.023,-0.9776,5,0,0,0,0,0,85.0,6,0,0,9,16,6,0,1,29,0,37,5,3,4,0,53,60,34,0,7,19,0,1,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,22,12,1,0,9,0,3,8,7,3,0,1,18,5,46,3,83,33,11,70,0,0,2,0,70,35,0,11,22,269,68,28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11702772478587906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767249147887874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051162025240140525,0.07497110661025869,0.0,0.0,0.1368077710647434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062262110343210934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07460148731634061,0.0,0.0774039461244629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12806276961841634,0.5241467638096116,0.08575446032043374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224795742893198,0.0,0.06480672459631028,0.07560396262127107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06991687924623059,0.0,0.07157410430060958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802269087018579,0.0,0.0,0.19114100188302893,0.0,0.04158408337415412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07205751378105868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2178292077819821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08042441673059274,0.059643152607105926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07482107760955367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06475297022444447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048841409479542665,0.07418269245223075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05378822181225127,0.05425447935414522,0.0,0.0,0.15563382417072094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049581749933112464,0.1112978596745242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923576274150572,0.06984885315905212,0.25363363091131697,0.06388904681643777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735558583433065,0.08196692137105346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0696012352401897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2421072577453796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1239930676994069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05843349656606195,0.0,0.16763151670678314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07605143811510702,0.0,0.0,0.06395363003641807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04861076366245665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12799769588134602,0.0,0.0,0.1398337584924612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12074549544493972,0.04315744363337405,0.0,0.11738479958690973,0.08910110398853817,0.0,0.06782913738845697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37287939946129744,0.0,0.0,0.05197772637020282,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Chloebethx,2019/03/11,"My boyfriend may be autistic Hi, not sure on the rules of this community yet so if any are broken feel free to let me know
So my boyfriend who is 26 is in the process of seeking a diagnosis, it’s looking likely that he’s autistic just not sure to what extent
He’s not great at keeping time, cannot read a normal clock and struggles with emotions and over reads peoples body language
I’ve never dealt with autism before  so I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do to help him, every approach I’ve tried so far has seemed to make him feel stupid

autism,beejonez,2019/03/11,"Autistic adults, what do you wish your parents did differently? Or things you were glad they did? My son is most likely on the spectrum, though we haven't gotten his official diagnosis. He's scheduled to start that next month. I'm more than happy to go into more detail about him but my primary question is this. What are some of the things you wish your parents knew about you when you were young? What do you wish they had done differently in regards to how they treated and interacted with you? My son will be four this summer, and I still feel like I barely know him as his verbal communication is still very limited. He loves playing games with me such as basketball, trucks, trains, blocks, etc. But I can't get more than single word answers from him most of the time. I want to keep pushing him so that he has an easier time communicating with people, but obviously I don't want to take it too far and torment him. I want him to have a happy childhood and just want to be the best dad I can be to him.

Thanks for the input.",4.259917491749178,5.667065618811886,4.850118811881189,84.27524422442245,71.02970297029701,7.762904290429042,25.34785478547855,8.238735603445708,1.3960821122112206,813,24,165,12,15,260,123,202,0.023,0.7559999999999999,0.221,0.9922,4,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,9,3,2,12,10,0,0,7,0,22,1,0,1,1,35,41,14,0,7,5,5,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,10,9,0,3,5,2,0,2,3,0,0,1,8,1,33,10,24,29,9,18,0,0,0,1,35,4,0,5,14,123,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14601643730375816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29073857558894434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14238617981435026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1551753204880663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07035220427813929,0.09940000426697793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07269370817570643,0.0,0.0790751641922675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29622934849679616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236719852127328,0.0,0.0,0.07646644391338983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13595130911118414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255772110788154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11105838869545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14797452777111486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089919111738658,0.0,0.0,0.09646056558966454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15586607278156886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09848238375065857,0.0,0.22223110192018933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046142382736435,0.0,0.0,0.1280993050417624,0.0,0.0,0.18487381739472866,0.0,0.1367020887409708,0.0,0.16226462942534026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114803178320382,0.3282680934165957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4800044823519838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Yes because I can cover it or mask as alot of people say and that's okay. It's the way I cope with situations.

But I like a challenge, if you have questions or want some advice don't hesitate. I work in a SEN school full of children with multiple learning difficulties and complex behaviours.

autism,aimsterdamn,2019/03/11,"Birthday present Hi all! First of all, sorry if this post seems ignorant or ill-informed, and sorry if this is not the right place to post. 
I have very limited knowledge / experience dealing with people who have autism, but my boyfriend's sister has mild autism. 
She's turning 29 tomorrow, but has the mindset of about a 12 year old. She doesn't do much with her day except for watch youtube videos and play around on Facebook and Instagram. 
Anyways my question is what should I get her for a birthday present? Should I get her something that a 12/13 year old would like? Or should I get her something that a 29 year old would like? In the past I've gotten her blankets, pj's, bath bombs, etc. Stuff that pretty much anyone would like. 
Anyways, thanks in advance everyone! Again, I'm sorry if this seems ignorant or rude or anything, but I am not sure where else to go.

autism,Anonieme_Angsthaas,2019/03/11,"I have a 'reset' button, does anyone else? So.. One of the biggest problems with my Asperger's is that every time someone asks me a question its like a reset button is pressed, similar to the reset button on computers and old gameconsoles. This is quite irritating because I spend a lot of time on the phone for work, someone will walk up to my desk and asks me a question while I'm on the phone.

&lt;reset&gt;

I'll tell them I'm on the phone or give the answer if I have one and I'll go back to the call. But after the reset I have to start over again with the conversation. I have to dig to remember what I was doing. It can be frustrating at times because due to the nature of my work this happens every day, every day.

I'm pretty sure other people have the same problem, and I'm interested in seeing how people cope with the 'reset button'.",4.610860962566843,5.146969123529414,5.985508021390379,79.6756951871658,69.52941176470588,8.299465240641712,27.807486631016044,8.296473431620573,1.8734705882352944,661,21,128,9,11,224,94,170,0.07,0.866,0.064,-0.2247,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,1,3,4,6,1,0,17,0,13,0,0,1,1,20,24,10,0,3,3,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,4,0,1,2,0,3,0,2,1,2,12,3,23,21,2,23,0,0,1,0,12,9,0,5,13,88,19,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1004131597475484,0.14714205837575065,0.0,0.0,0.2685058010536327,0.0,0.0,0.11042470567666267,0.0,0.17508265086857294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14663852038203845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18522891210058048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12567121105009066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11996498985825844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.362984573516048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13776065429254847,0.08161501010183309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12699095088461973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015899100435721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12208930047363102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15069109854250648,0.0,0.19462326415845155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.199117639917562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14609966484468676,0.0,0.2748244788079537,0.0,0.0,0.32174479141567786,0.15274342681649608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16267842270680616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144359654096853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2433550207609985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1016455776825131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.135347636916225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255186056286934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512147051162436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.209094809390557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was diagnosed by a professional, and its a great news because it explains everything about my whole life. I always felt different from everyone else. I didn't understand why I'm like this. It always felt like I didn't belong anywhere, and I spent my whole life seeking an explanation to it. Finally at 21yo I found out the truth. I know having autism is not something to celebrate, but my discovery made me love myself a little bit more. Just getting it out of my chest. Thank you.

autism,gninaws,2019/03/11,"Is it possible that even some high-fuctioning autistic people will never be able to live alone? I'm 26 and I have spent a grand total of 8 months living on my own. I went straight from my mums to my boyfriend's, then we broke up after 11 years and I lived alone for 8 months (I still lived with him for a few months after we broke up as it was on good terms) now I'm living with my current boyfriend. 

I loved living alone, I loved the peace and the undisturbed order, everything how I wanted it and my routine was undisturbed. The trouble was, I didn't look after myself. I forgot to eat a lot of the time and when I did remember my diet became very limited to basically broccoli and chicken (I know how to cook a lot of things but those are my favourite foods). I was terrible at managing my own money and I had a lot of meltdowns as I was working a horrible job and studying at the same time and because I was alone there was no one there to pull me out of them so I began self harming a lot as a way of managing overloads... 

I lived long way away from my parents and an hour away from my boyfriend so there was no immediate help nearby. I was really sad when I ended up having to move in with my boyfriend and felt like a failure... my mum (also autistic) said some people with autism just can't live on their own. Is that true?

autism,Toxsic99,2019/03/12,"Hello everyone - We are looking for some assistance from you all Hello,

I would be VERY interested in anyone sharing information, documents, videos for education concerning an aide.   What I would like to do is show the person, responsible for caring for our boy (17M), what it is like for people with autism in general and in various circumstances.   

I also would love ANY information I can use to provide to those we employ that provide assistance to our son with an online education.  Something that maybe some of you have used in the past (or present) to help educate persons responsible for care can use to help understand \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  &lt;&lt; this could be anything related to Autism. non verbal communication etc.

I recognize that there is not a one size fits all package but I thought that between the bunch of us, we could bring that information together to access.  

I would also love it if you all could send/ post anything that I can use as a parent of a non verbal young adult.

I am hoping to provide future aides with education and information that can help them and of course, my son.

Thanks.

autism,dunnothelyrics,2019/03/12,"Choosing a Retail Job When You’re a Potato So the other day I was applying for a Second job and I got 2 callbacks- one from a grocery store and one from a competitive clothing retail. The problem is what do I choose ??

Grocery PROS : consistent, repetitive work as a cashier, unionised, flexible schedule, so easy 

Grocery CONS: Potentially Boring, nasty customers, occasionally working outside in the freezing cold, unglamorous, hours based on seniority

Retail PROS: I like competition, I’m good at sales, it’s close to current work, great icebreaker job, sounds more fun 

Retail CONS: not flexible hrs, I’m clumsy and forgetful, I have awkward potato syndrome, potentially bitchy coworkers, hrs based on commission 

I don’t know if you can tell but I sort of want the clothing retail job lmao. I think It’d be more fulfilling, but like my current food retail position it’ll probably consist of me making all the mistakes and being an awkward little shit. They’ve slowly grown used to me at my food retail job and sometime I impress them with my skillz so that’s cool. 

I need help deciding.

I wonder - how many autistic people actually had potty training issues or delayed potty training? How many adults on the spectrum wear diapers as an adult? It can't be that many. Potty training is full stop, the hardest thing about parenting, whether your child is NT or not. I hate how every discussion where a person who thinks positively about their own autism (I'm fine, I'm happy being myself, I don't need a cure, I'm just different, what we need to cure is ableism, etc.) is almost always, without fail, shot down by someone going ""I have an autistic son in diapers at age 7 and he throws fits all the time and isn't it horrible and I do want to cure him"". And it becomes clear we're not talking about the same thing. I didn't know autistic people were ""supposed"" to have bathroom issues, any more than any other kid. But the world of ""autism parents"" is full of toilet horror stories which, even if they're not made up for the sake of martyr parenting on social media, I think it should be addressed that they're not the story of every child on the spectrum. Plus disrespect your child's privacy/ desire to not be humiliated much? I don't get why autism is a label used to describe very low-functioning people along with people who are very high-functioning. It makes the label confusing and unclear. But I don't even think low-functioning people need a ""cure"" for autism. They need people who understand them and can help them better. And imo you should be able to toilet train any child, autistic or not.

autism,PierraNova,2019/03/12,"I don't believe in neurodiversity. In my eyes, neurodiversity's just causing more problems than it's solving. Either your brain developped normally, or it fucked up somewhere and voilà, you're not how you should've been and you'll require more help. Labeling people with expressions like these make all of those disorders seem much more beautiful, pretty and safe. If you've got tourettes or ADHD or Asperger's, you've got tourettes, ADHD or Asperger's ; you're not Neurodiverse, your brain did a goof and now you're not how you should've been. It's not normal and it shouldn't be treated as a positive thing. It's not something to be ashamed of, but it's not something to be proud of either. It's just there. I find it pretty harmful to have people be proud of their disabilities.

autism,SpookySphinx,2019/03/12,"I Have Limits [vent] I really hate when neurotypical people tell me to just 'get through' something. As if I don't want to be able to do the things 'normal' abled people can do. As if I want to have the issues that I do. I love the good things my autism gives me, the different outlook, the fascinating way my brain works, but this world is A Lot, too much input, overwhelming, and exhausting. And that's not even touching on the drain and expectations that social situations come with.

I was discussing my writing with a friend. Said that I'd never be able to go on a book tour or anything even if I 'made it big' (which I don't want to do anyway because my writing isn't mainstream and never will be). I know he was trying to be supportive, but having him say that I would have to do all of that eventually if I want to be a successful author and that, essentially, I would have to get over it was just... Frustrating. 

We aren't even going to touch the lack of understanding about the publishing industry here (which... I'm pretty damn competent about).

The idea that a successful 'disabled' person is someone who can just ignore their limitations is fucking awful.

I have spent most of my life not even knowing I was autistic, which led to me getting mad at myself for not being able to perform like my peers. Which led to me pushing myself a lot. Which led to constant burnout. Which would then cycle into depression (""why am I such a fuck up"" and ""Why can't I just be like my friends/family/peers??""), a spiral into some really dark stuff, and then attempted suicide. The world is telling me I should be able to do stuff that it says is simple. Obviously I'm somehow wrong. Obviously it's me that's a problem because I just can't do some things. 

Not to say that I'm completely inept. I just have limits that I need to accommodate and now that I know what they are, I can better take care of myself.

I say that I can't do any kind of book tour because of the immense stress it would cause me. Knowing myself better since my diagnosis lets me see that. I'd be away from home for long stretches of time, in unfamiliar spaces, continuously getting up in front of large groups of people, engaging with large groups of people, having to mask and socialize for long stretches of time, all with no chance to recoup.

I cannot do that. I will burnout.

But when I say ""I can't do x"" NTs just brush it off. ""Don't say you can't do something! Push yourself! Smile and work hard and Do The Things!"" because if I don't fit their performance standards I am somehow lesser. Like I haven't spent my life pushing myself. So much so that my therapist tells me I am too hard on myself. That I need to be gentler. And I'm trying. By saying out loud (as difficult as it is) that I can't do something, I'm trying to be gentle on me. To be nice to myself. To try and be okay with the fact that I *don't* and *won't* perform like my peers. I have my own ways that I have to do things and that doesn't always look like how NTs do things.

But they just... can't stomach that. If someone's journey doesn't look like the inspo porn they see in movies, it's wrong or bad or you get told your lazy, selfish, a pain in the ass.

I wish I could say it was just this one person who does this, but it's *everyone* I know. 

I'm really sick of it. 

I'm sick of hating myself because of this crap.",2.947876506845581,4.430327499263626,4.259396989036167,86.92062114765724,74.44918998527245,7.2093056237386115,24.356106474663182,7.857877913537022,1.1611848906343751,2608,80,550,37,54,860,260,679,0.159,0.722,0.12,-0.9847,1,0,3,0,0,1,102.0,1,3,5,16,31,40,8,2,25,2,84,14,4,6,7,103,130,40,1,23,27,0,4,6,1,8,6,10,1,2,55,25,0,4,7,2,2,11,26,20,0,1,10,19,81,20,74,97,11,50,0,2,4,5,38,24,5,16,19,395,136,9,0.304650225457306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05069867852024067,0.0,0.0,0.0414345200424683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050140235533974085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05724578305786252,0.0,0.05087404260168638,0.1857119497776128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10777534691160597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06801808109782259,0.0,0.0,0.062122241745380974,0.06259194026230072,0.0,0.05248583873139539,0.06388399303577809,0.0658437329487915,0.0,0.048647683082639136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247895855560586,0.0,0.0,0.0636589288215422,0.0,0.0,0.05332029305986583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609748805518757,0.0,0.0,0.05822126918461015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0470744016941511,0.1126576897467791,0.1591671688270879,0.05844965125759604,0.06925589751783508,0.05110523101630839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10916270504285536,0.12031161028324085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06111780315895107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06878260447768136,0.0,0.06359513695279567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06344926579480317,0.16742779661963908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06230509924287395,0.08607338552721264,0.17860405401738758,0.0,0.0,0.10784234509848142,0.10233178450568756,0.0,0.0,0.10360109091545716,0.054991744562829716,0.05765348189239804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08958118768613185,0.09035771278704093,0.09398601398533392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059698507516133724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04128777543593519,0.0,0.06483386386490758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16896488583310404,0.10640353038493268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06198776060462941,0.0,0.05830182437019814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11710004126568654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05795842572191073,0.38763213927735135,0.0,0.0,0.09710671459672686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05040196293336948,0.06848792355161773,0.0,0.12422101573846922,0.1032516589610506,0.140720776452242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979516079113518,0.0,0.13950064848830634,0.06664757998356803,0.06914269311608869,0.0,0.0,0.04581181107110692,0.0,0.15976663503115413,0.0,0.0,0.07074447853400159,0.2428752873675153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105759855854818,0.0,0.0,0.05822126918461015,0.0,0.16547000425560174,0.0,0.0,0.06343032575366224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14375247695191004,0.09672686746689728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10995977726555684,0.0,0.0700665448657629,0.0,0.0,0.08871559699983685,0.0,0.0,0.17313182345830966,0.13323487869758366,0.0,0.0
autism,Denom56,2019/03/12,"The idea of grasping other's emotions and perspectives Hello there fellow autistic redditors! I come to you as a curious and supportive roomate to someone with autism. I have a serious question I'd like to get your advise on. I should preface it with I also have mental illness, and struggle with OCD and depression. I know that each disorder has their special quirks, such as us with OCD are supposed to refrain from reassuring ourselves or seeking reassurance. I'm sure within the autism community there are rules of the same calibar.

&amp;#x200B;

When my roomate tells me about his interpersonal communications, he often lacks perpsective. He only see's life through the lenses of how he would approach something. I try to advise him people may think differently than him, and may respond to problems differntly. I then try to give him examples of this, but he lacks the ability to grasp it.  I don't know how else to convey it to him. I understand this issue is a common one in those with autism. Is there any specific approach to manage this issue? I ask, because my efforts are not working.

autism,p3ntuphanger,2019/03/12,"Frustration with Medical Claims - how can this be legal? About 10 months ago - we suspected our son was on the spectrum when some milestones were missed. We went to a leading medical university to have him evaluated. They recommended he get the full autism spectrum analysis with their Pediatric Dev group based on their initial assessment. Only catch was, they couldn't get him in until October (6 months later) for the full testing they do. They recommended that we continue the OT and PT (at their hospital) in the meantime. 

As suspected, his results put him clearly on the autism spectrum. We felt a huge relief because now we could get him ABA therapy, OT, PT, Speech, etc. without the typical visit caps that health insurance imposes. Fast forward to last month we received notice that all of our claims prior to the October date he received the diagnosis would have to paid out of pocket. Their reason is because he was not diagnosed with autism until October - because they had such a backlog of patients. So we now owe thousands of dollars to the same university hospital that delayed the diagnosis 6 months for services the same hospital provided. 

There has to be something against this sort of thing. It would be different if they told us up front we are going to pay through the nose while we wait for them to test him - but to have to pay the same hospital system? How is this legal?

autism,winningwriters,2019/03/12,"Supporting and promoting fiction, essays and poetry from neurodiverse writers Hey there writers and poets of /r/autism,

I'm from a writers' resource website called [Winning Writers](https://winningwriters.com/). Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes underrepresented in publishing, including (but of course not limited to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body positive, neurodiverse, and [dis]abled. We are interested primarily in the representation of the voices/themes in the poetry, rather than the identity of the writer.  At this time of year we're offering two contests: 

[The Tom Howard/John H. Reid Fiction and Essay Contest]( https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/tom-howard-john-h-reid-fiction-essay-contest), with two first prizes of $2000 each, ten honorable mentions receiving $100 each, and the top twelve entries published online. The contest is international. The deadline is April 30.

[The Wergle Flomp Humor Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/wergle-flomp-humor-poetry-contest-free), with a first prize of $1000, a second prize of $250, and ten honorable mentions of $100 each. The top twelve entries will be published online. The contest is international and the deadline is April 1.

Since I started doing outreach on Reddit last year we've received hundreds more entries featuring diverse characters and voices. We're working hard to increase the diversity of our entry pool and give good writers the exposure they deserve. I know /r/autism isn't technically a ""writers' subreddit,"" but in the past some of our strongest entries have come from subs like this one, which ostensibly have nothing to do with writing.

autism,HopefullyGinger,2019/03/13,"Dating someone on the spectrum! Hi! Please let me know if this isn’t allowed. I’ve been lurking for a bit and thought I’d put this out there.

So first of all, I’m 27 and have my own list of mental disorders including ADHD-PI, Social and General Anxiety, and MDD. This all makes socializing pretty difficult but I’ve been in therapy for a while and I can do Standup comedy and run RPG’s at conventions. And that is how I met my boyfriend!

He was at a table where I was running a game and he was so quiet I had to lean in to just barely hear him. I instantly liked him. I’ve only ever had one other boyfriend and it was a very short relationship. Still I asked him to dinner right after the game and we ate together after the convention was over.
He told me he has high functioning autism. I told him I didn’t mind, and I don’t. 

That was 4 months ago. And since I’m his first girlfriend, neither of us have much clue as to what we’re doing. 

I’ve noticed he doesn’t pick up on the signals I’m putting out. I’ve noticed he’s very hesitant to say things. And he NEVER will definitively say yes or no to a decision. (Do you want to do this? I guess, I don’t mind, etc.) Still, I really like him. Even though I’m pushing 30, I feel like I’m a 13 year old around him. Awkward and giddy, like kids holding hands on the playground.

I wonder if anyone has any advice for dating someone who has high functioning autism. Or if you just have dating advice in general, that’s cool too. (I’m pretty clueless myself.)",1.1486676045016075,3.2751854212218667,3.149508641479102,89.79233370176851,82.2475884244373,6.459847266881027,22.258942926045016,7.6454224807358475,0.9921936495176849,1170,39,250,20,32,394,169,311,0.057,0.8270000000000001,0.116,0.9672,1,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,2,2,0,2,15,7,0,1,12,2,29,3,1,4,4,46,48,26,0,4,8,0,2,4,1,1,0,4,0,1,12,18,2,1,5,3,0,5,8,2,0,3,16,7,30,5,29,30,7,39,2,0,0,0,34,18,0,7,20,157,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13251876212532754,0.2155020629503898,0.0977444937881736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07498492037075168,0.0,0.08435347975999646,0.0,0.0,0.07710081751438276,0.0,0.0,0.0981604570452663,0.10308418149890328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12038232946291128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12637482581807338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297616257296275,0.0728299047961809,0.0997422546108878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055753995438598734,0.07877432471891778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18758505493671865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147085036780672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427822546163356,0.0,0.0,0.2330049714383627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06059951935973312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275484549187915,0.0,0.21548233622046686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360366564365346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11112257725982637,0.0,0.22267522307975546,0.0,0.08801357342357335,0.0,0.08105847755056805,0.0,0.08504423084219691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2510780115378422,0.11570601820496272,0.0,0.07471935357706264,0.08386255165065568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12103937411928616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22436110219861294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2216963376497285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063946729055409,0.0,0.0,0.11838482730355332,0.0,0.09416688700857268,0.0,0.17537650410252456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09121348994062453,0.0,0.0,0.22480537879951076,0.18685669382454295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17611774883112033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260992166443746,0.0,0.07325608399554365,0.0,0.10833615961737976,0.08753918975112805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21072850508307805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13263687977040345,0.0,0.0,0.1819626249408117,0.06503796849999156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11957918669778568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07100793422905939
autism,michelle204,2019/03/13,"New to this! Advise please! My daughter is in the process of doing autism testing.  I am in Ontario Canada so I don’t think we will have the diagnosis Until May.  What would be the most appropriate action?s should I start private autism therapy now? She is 23 months old.  Or should I continue with speech therapy until hopefully something clicks and wait for the formal diagnosis.

Non verbal (has about 20 words. 5 which she uses correctly (I rarely hear them)
Minimal eye contact
Does not respond to name
Did not walk until 19 months
Shows no. Affection
Does not point gestures with hand kind of
In her  own world
Understands questions.    Bring mummy your boots, etc
Does not play with me acknowledge my presence or my husbands. Doesn’t engage with us
Interacts with her baby brother...brings him toys occasionally. And smiles at kids her own age

This is very new.  I am beside myself:  I thought she was a silent quirky kid.  My teenage niece and nephew  (my sisters son and my brothers daughter) had similar problems which were managed with psychologists, speech therapy, OT PT. Never tested for autism formally.  They are managing well.

I am a mom to a 14 yr old who was diagnosed as communicatively handicapped through school and was placed in special education from 1st grade on. Now as my teen is older we are noticing signs that could put her in the spectrum possibly and have started the process of having her assessed to see if she lands on the spectrum somewhere. I was just wondering if others had gone through the same thing as a young child and later diagnosed with ASD?

autism,PodcastJunkie,2019/03/13,"Has anyone here played the PC game “To The Moon”? What were your thought about it? I played [To The Moon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/) almost a year ago and I still think about the whole story regularly. I started playing it in the early evening and couldn’t stop until I finally finished at 2am. I was weeping by the end just because of how true it was.  
  
**SPOILER BELOW**  
  
in the story, you follow the final hours of an elderly man. During these final moments, you travel through his life memories to give him a happy ending. By that, I mean you see where things went wrong and what you can change about his memories to make him feel like he fulfilled his life’s wishes. Along the way, you find out that he married a woman called River who, as you later find out, has Aspergers Syndrome. You see how she struggled all her life to make a meaningful connection with her husband (the protagonist). Anyway, River dies before the elderly man and she dies having never been able to make the connection she wanted to with her husband and it’s a huge regret of his. The husband, who is now dying, wanted to be a rocket engineer all his life so that’s what the player changes his memory to.   
Cut to the final section of the game when the player changes his memory so that he gets a job at NASA in his youth. There, he meets River who still has Aspergers but, in this alternate reality, it’s like she was able to find enough support to get to do something great with her life. River and the man still get together and the game ends with a rocket blasting off and the two of them watching from a bridge.  
  
**This is where it really got to me.** Because what happened to River in the altered memories was wonderful and fantastic and exciting. But that’s not what really happened. She died feeling lonely, disconnected, misunderstood and having never had the support to live a full life. Her husband was a good man but he didn’t understand how to reach her and he shouldn’t be blamed for that.  
As a 30 year old married man, I really felt like that was me there. Disconnected from those I care about, misunderstood and unfulfilled. My life so far has been nothing but wasted potential because the world just isn’t built for people like me.

autism,Zeshangar,2019/03/13,"New to this Sub and wanted to introduce myself and ask some questions... Hello everyone. I am very excited to have found this subreddit and be able to talk with you. I am a father of three, and only about a week ago, my youngest daughter, Sonmi, was diagnosed with Autism and is non-verbal. We are still getting our bearings, but we have always been and will continue to be her guides through life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sonmi is currently in pre-school and has great support around her. She is a twin, and having her brother by her side has made the transition easier. She loves art, her sequin bear, and colored lights and dance music. I have just learned about stimming and definitely understand that this is part of her coping with stress and expressing herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot on my mind and I am afraid I will ramble, so let me just ask a couple of questions. 

What resources would you recommend to learn more about Autism, specifically in younger children? (The place that diagnosed her gave us a lot of material, but I would love to hear from you all as well)

We recently discovered that Sonmi loves the Trampoline Park. We met another family while playing and their son was also non-verbal autistic and loved it there as well. They play music, but not too loud and have party lights and each person has their own area to jump. My question is, is there any other activities you and your family have enjoyed that you would recommend we try? I know everyone is different, but it never hurts to give things a shot :).

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for reading my post, and thanks in advance for any replies.",5.886724778046813,7.42617139322034,5.6885714285714295,79.29870056497177,67.27118644067797,9.14447134786118,30.65778853914447,9.48565724429506,2.8394568200161423,1271,49,225,26,21,395,172,295,0.011,0.7709999999999999,0.218,0.9971,2,0,0,0,0,0,53.0,7,7,3,1,14,17,0,2,10,0,32,7,0,1,3,56,51,28,0,4,7,4,0,0,0,5,3,2,0,2,12,29,0,0,8,5,0,3,2,3,2,1,7,5,41,14,31,36,9,21,0,1,1,4,49,8,0,6,9,172,53,3,0.08861254522247264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854967476468837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086342039958056,0.07373273622809147,0.2880349671798563,0.3230218247151293,0.12051913880986825,0.09291797993591146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.078883952198561,0.16568153593737606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09804809585111904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17987973624277287,0.0,0.09258124953863868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16934616873454525,0.0,0.0,0.16707204264236233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971590820739346,0.0,0.0,0.046296397530813056,0.08500522784000576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09769564393754164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987277862934782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09486156238890943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0486991374360098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906123311735992,0.06258966127492932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15067043426708365,0.31990512691212913,0.08384733285121243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08947341007757878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06834345766570334,0.08558254835558363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06739383367590683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09595875124644407,0.0,0.0,0.07737305654305955,0.09258124953863868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486632355321289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977989917485192,0.0,0.0886365250356784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749419811008217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968062656314875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07076609308015767,0.0,0.10150537116180387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055646621229217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07122340726626794,0.0,0.16316505233987358,0.0,0.0,0.05887023758959676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060162101525824664,0.0,0.0,0.09224878466584724,0.1065899813277138,0.0,0.0,0.07311463006501903,0.05226597504409503,0.0,0.07107963875113643,0.0,0.15934664018773284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18884342912375351,0.0,0.3230218247151293,0.0
autism,mkst13,2019/03/13,"Wanted: thoughts and opinions on speech therapy Hi All! I am finishing up a graduate program in speech-language pathology this semester. I will be working with adolescents and young adults (from about 10-21)  on all parts of the spectrum. I have a lot of text book knowledge about ASD and speech and language interventions, but textbooks tend to remove the human element from learning Therefore, I would like to know your thoughts and anecdotes from therapy sessions. What are some of the best and worst experiences you have had with medical/educational service providers (not just speech therapists)? What makes somebody a good therapist in your opinion? 

One example- I learned in school to target eye contact. I learned in practice that this makes people uncomfortable and that eye contact is unnecessary for someone to be an effective communicator. Now, I do not target eye contact unless the person explicitly states that he or she wants to improve eye contact.",7.652991452991451,10.3530740617284,6.824320987654321,68.33098290598294,64.55555555555556,9.922886989553657,41.473884140550815,10.214889679676881,5.09961861348528,786,47,112,20,13,241,107,162,0.052000000000000005,0.823,0.125,0.926,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,3,0,3,4,4,0,0,8,0,11,5,4,4,3,36,19,10,0,3,6,0,0,1,0,2,1,3,0,3,7,9,0,0,8,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,3,7,11,3,24,12,7,12,0,0,4,0,13,7,0,5,4,82,18,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20583034957074614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19185651665949013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16450774748606187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10779002125892707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09582108013203587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1667459647933286,0.0,0.0,0.2618417033101467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13290535627377525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21239382012515984,0.0,0.13597449918469914,0.17125649136195262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19849790268785816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661835540324739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4485922458277084,0.4554529772887949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31141669848072195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2313696240934144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427877610480531,0.0,0.0,0.13932784241887194,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,3rdEyeFromTheSun,2019/03/13,"Little Niece's Birthday Food Overview: Niece is turning 4. Level 3 autistic, but was caught around 1yr old, so she is a bit unusual and therapy has made a huge impact. Basically she is just very quirky little girl who is adorable.

Food things: She doesn't like sweets. Cupcakes even pancakes are no. She loves bananas and yogurt. It's a plus if the banana food resembles a banana. Yellow is also her favorite color. All makes sense to me. So this where we begin.


My thought was putting yogurt in ramekin cups with banana or a little banana boat. She doesn't mind candles and these should hold a 4 shaped candle ok.

I feel like we could get a bit more creative without overdoing it though.

She also likes doors lol. (Must verify they open and close).

Does anyone have ideas based on this info for a birthday food?

Thanks!",2.4413328776486694,5.290008519480518,2.7424812030075216,89.83672932330828,83.93506493506493,4.800546821599453,21.74162679425837,6.339386263674448,0.5183818181818185,648,21,117,6,19,198,111,154,0.067,0.73,0.202,0.9785,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,2,0,1,0,9,8,0,0,9,2,15,5,0,2,2,28,25,13,0,4,5,0,1,3,0,2,0,0,1,1,7,11,4,1,4,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,5,4,13,8,8,17,4,16,0,0,2,1,13,12,0,2,5,70,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20714581769866675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905597333698444,0.0,0.0,0.1152955974276552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2827931534336413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10340699921447476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11333924152545667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554327920664326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06548655544775701,0.09252537227123392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6264390600641012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06766611792760409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620640237091567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18982311287162812,0.3894234505868103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689212982972412,0.12254999989684015,0.08645210972619084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13077298970540438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13590395660815285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301981086185318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192397925340227,0.1481114183430099,0.0,0.08604385333680556,0.0,0.12724759666047178,0.10282025455560874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14087487059558193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068632430184215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484760938987735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,BlitzOmega,2019/03/14,"being ""Wrong"" all the time [rant] anyone here ever just....feel like they're always getting dog-piled for all the little things you do or say? I've been diagnosed with an Autism/Asperger mix since I was about 3. but. not just family, even peers...they always seem to rail on me for the same few things that I keep doing without realizing it.

&amp;#x200B;

it's always the smallest things: the things I say, the way I say them, how loudly I say it. the things I do, the things I don't do. how I do them when they are done. always ***wrong***.

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong, wrong, WRONG.

Everything and Anything I do, say, or think. and I know a lot of it can often become exaggerated in my head from living with a toxic parent that I am thankfully free from, but the same things keep happening even in this safer home of mine. maybe not to the abusive extents, but...it still hurts me. and I've tried to explain this, but it's always the same things.

&amp;#x200B;

""Have you tried getting over yourself?""

""it's only hard because you tell yourself it's hard""

""You don't even try to fix your problems""

&amp;#x200B;

how the hell am I supposed fix my 'problem' to when every method I've tried is wrong? when I tried to partake in a hobby to get away from the computer that you so frequently curse out as 'a waste of time' is worse because it's also a 'waste of money'? when I tried to explain that I have a hard time reading small print from your novels, it's because I have 'too short an attention span' or it's because I'm 'lazy' rather than the fact that I can't keep my place in the book without a piece of paper to divide the lines and a heavy squint to focus on the text I'm reading, which inevitably leads to a headache.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I be ""right"" for once? what do they expect out of me? I've asked, but they never give a straight answer, and expecting one is also ""wrong"" because I 'should already know.' I don't know. and I'm begining to doubt there even IS an answer. that I just have to live with being ""Wrong"" and disappointing everyone I come into contact with by existing another day.",2.3938801383019594,4.453706746958641,3.3279145857344083,90.46719266231274,77.63746958637468,5.980817006018697,22.73793059290562,6.950104931194217,0.6465630170316299,1607,49,331,17,38,512,187,411,0.157,0.7979999999999999,0.045,-0.9934,1,0,1,0,0,0,93.0,0,7,5,1,25,17,1,1,30,0,31,2,1,5,5,64,53,26,0,6,14,1,3,1,0,1,1,6,1,0,28,15,0,3,11,4,2,2,9,14,0,1,3,9,41,4,47,46,9,34,1,2,0,0,24,18,1,7,14,227,69,6,0.0,0.06341521275655011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05906322555791496,0.08560358098008987,0.22267434386438373,0.2899571280810898,0.3251774654964961,0.0,0.05612283301524945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03742405980089802,0.0,0.04404431979139616,0.0,0.05003615651963643,0.0,0.05028599385020768,0.0,0.0,0.16313358758649166,0.05911121193779409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046104750825090524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034517477095309966,0.0,0.0,0.0543240415199693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054771929378667504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14140398508109406,0.048414014553580235,0.04509487408563068,0.05114288298247812,0.04810242190320855,0.0,0.05045609233649532,0.0,0.027062499811287742,0.038236365502949336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388963006798736,0.05134349897380901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0473296224521502,0.0,0.14383649295814238,0.0,0.054929355014468925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05368726410262807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05729676462177176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427193267427362,0.0,0.0,0.0882434237225021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026148308463939517,0.05364343864659901,0.09452240150772644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04550277367490698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05377037754859197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04127972287928122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056999538034185435,0.0362681181173053,0.04070614617600611,0.0,0.0,0.059430217031810575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05591944650307673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10242728896807372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10707363412464307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045707780076596816,0.0,0.2128155377853473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048724721949564516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04427422707352949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04274300439827281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046780878273161255,0.0492761734204254,0.0,0.0,0.2844628792909921,0.03429494995109801,0.0,0.0,0.0936279086403792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2180289054998312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042483536801949585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10318723843243474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0545438300297115,0.0,0.4681461538606488,0.3251774654964961,0.0

autism,fuckingtakethename,2019/03/14,"I was successful at comforting I successfully comforted my friend last night. I spent the night and couldn't fall asleep. I heard her trying not to cry so I crawled over and hugged her and pet her head until her heart was beating slower and her breathing went back to normal. Her and I lay there for an hour or more, with me just holding her and petting her head. I've never comforted anyone like that. I'm really proud of myself.

autism,Hefaistros,2019/03/14,"What do I do in a job interview? First post on reddit, so be gentile ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory:**

(Backstory gives a little context but is not entirely important for my problem)

I recently quit my schooling to become a primary teacher. In december I got diagnosed with autism, which in itsself was not a problem to become a teacher for me. all my placements and traineeships in schools were awesome and my mentors told me they thought I would be a really good teacher. The problem was that in the testing we found out that the 4 parts which your IQ consist of did not line up. The rational part of my IQ is on the high side at 123, but my processing speed is very low at 89.  Which runs down to me understanding everything that I hear, but I can not oversee large quantities of information. This is why I had troubles in school. I could not write my master thesis. which is why I quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem:**

Now that I quit school I want to start working. I have a degree as a teachers aid/educational assistant but I am scared that the quitting of my schooling will become a problem during a job interview. I feel that my Autism is in such a mild form that it would not impede on any job duties I would have. But I'm scared that telling them would lover my chances in getting jobs. How much or what should I tell them? Only the IQ part, or a bigger backstory?

autism,conarkay,2019/03/14,"Clothing texture issues &amp; buying weather-appropriate clothes. i have very bad texture issues; it can be next to impossible to find fabrics that i can tolerate wearing without sensory overload (i prefer mostly cotton, some polyester and spandex is okay, fleece or fluffy is great. soft.). i am also fairly picky about the cut and fit of my clothes-mostly over-sized, with the exception of underwear and leggings, which have to be fitted, preferably no seams. it's a fairly androgynous style. i just want to be comfortable, man.

i am running into a lot of issues with finding spring and summer appropriate clothes, since in the colder months i just wear heavy and soft hoodies, sweaters, sweatpants, and leggings.  that's it, that is my whole wardrobe! i really want to find something for the warmer months that will make me look like a more or less put together human, not just nike shorts and baggy t-shirts... i *do* want to fit in sometimes.

as some of you can relate, clothing stores are hell of sensory overload, and I do not usually have much luck there since i get so overwhelmed and anxious. i bought this romwe dress earlier ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K7JGLTD/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K7JGLTD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)), and loved the cut, however the texture is bad to me and i'll still have to wear something like a tank top under it... so, online shopping can be difficult as well, since i cant feel the fabric, and the description can be inaccurate.

**to summarize, i need help; do you have similar issues? do you have any advice? any brands you can recommend? how do you cope with severe texture issues? thank you guys!** ",7.907615658362987,11.175378081850539,6.052674733096088,71.68760996441281,65.33451957295374,7.62767259786477,30.10120996441281,8.488131031819089,2.545075330960854,1415,53,208,22,25,411,158,281,0.086,0.745,0.16899999999999998,0.9603,1,0,2,0,0,0,102.0,0,6,0,1,11,16,3,1,12,1,31,6,5,2,0,42,42,20,0,6,9,0,3,2,0,1,0,0,0,3,10,16,0,0,6,1,4,2,5,7,1,0,1,4,24,9,27,35,8,18,1,1,1,1,11,9,1,7,9,139,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10530365732026928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08617713271644394,0.0,0.35027984048286165,0.0,0.14656354098525867,0.0,0.0,0.12174024585160073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17995332926013735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05448764201624954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2954772051647861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056301132118789725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11880784791293827,0.0,0.10670119881063644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223051346755432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5623770018146059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10529401798420253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09049283470112414,0.0,0.0,0.09161529274951256,0.09725929973153176,0.0,0.07193188852432691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720290014571587,0.0,0.07921737756035081,0.07990406506352761,0.0,0.0,0.1146059768765689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10833044867138934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06903501669553204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12174024585160073,0.0,0.26742521040008393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16592071269637396,0.10657925010149223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08605877278863425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09921265647983056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186844811217708,0.08891483283050984,0.19068223813633406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689086754454043,0.0,0.0,0.12031228533538715,0.0,0.10387860226435516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,wollcen,2019/03/14,"how to bring up possibly being autistic 
two years ago a past therapist of mine casually mentioned that he found it interesting that i shared some “traits” found in folks on the spectrum. he meant it as a compliment but it got me interested in autism as a whole as i didn’t know much at all. i did research for pure educational purposes and discovered i have a lot more than a few traits. i didn’t bring it up with him though, i didn’t want him to assume i was looking for something that wasn’t really there and i figured he already thought that considering i brought up a panic disorder once and he sort of shut me down- i was diagnosed with one a year later by my current therapist. 

i stopped with the research, like i said no one takes me seriously when it comes to my genuine concerns. i’m just seen as the kid who’s looking for stuff to blame my stuff on when that clearly isn’t it. 

but in my last session with my current therapist he out of the blue asked me if i have any sensory issues. when i asked what he meant he listed the basics, the ones you read about everywhere.

i got somewhat excited, he noticed something in me after talking about something not at all related to my theory and felt the need to ask me. i felt if i didn’t give him a quick enough answer he would just assume i was faking and shut me down so i anxiously blurted out that i had a noise sensitivity. 

i do not have a noise sensitivity- im a jumpy person but have no issue with sound.

i do have a touch sensitivity thing that i always struggled with. i prefer if people didn’t touch me at all but i have spots i feel most uncomfortable with. certain spots even ache like my ribs, sides and arm when touched. 

i couldn’t take my words back so i started talking about how i’ve always been a jumpy person. i feel like he looked right through me and dismissed it as what it was, a jumpy kid who had no issue with noise. 

i want to bring it up again, tell him the truth without it seeming like i’m looking for something in return. if i’m autistic i want to know, personally i think it would explain a lot and then maybe i would deal with my issues differently but if not that’s just as good, i can stop kicking at myself and just continue with my treatment. 

anh recommendations on how i can bring this topic up in serious conversation? i see him tomorrow but i try to see him weekly.

autism,SquiggleWings,2019/03/14,"Hello all! I was wondering if you could help in sharing your experiences when travelling through an airport... Hello, I am not on the Autistic Spectrum however for several years I have been mildly working in a field for those that are. 
I am working in an airport, and we have Autism Awareness week coming up soon. Im part of the team helping to raise this awareness of how we can make the process easier-what we are doing right and far more importantly: where we can improve. 
I was hoping if you had any experiences, if you could detail what they were (private message is okay if you are more comfortable with that) so that we can really put some thought into where we can make things better-far beyond that one week.  I am based in the U.K. but welcome experiences from around the world.  

I’m sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub, please do let me know ",5.018760162601623,6.521701323170731,5.425365853658537,80.50723577235773,69.3048780487805,8.393495934959349,30.13008130081301,8.841846274778883,2.4289691056910567,683,27,127,12,12,218,104,164,0.009000000000000001,0.858,0.133,0.948,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,6,5,1,3,8,5,0,0,8,1,24,0,0,3,1,31,32,11,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,12,0,0,3,2,0,3,2,0,0,1,6,0,19,5,18,23,5,22,0,0,0,0,20,14,0,8,5,101,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11350689970590533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14858839747823258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14762142146362925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14378119564939268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2665336863526437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4898202762991166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22375719343987055,0.0,0.0,0.16578276141477047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802952161437619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09173129120070764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17068035646796118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2228321068527772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11310490336760905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807510485254513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18322089335687644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16779416340215014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10692905839445284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14254321197450429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18856473831291706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868459912528789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108899087685488,0.0,0.0,0.13251066990921578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677758738248337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810105643149225,0.2430300232919055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10748681773629216

autism,biwarlock,2019/03/15,"dealing with medical stuff is so confusing the pharmacy i get my prescriptions from feels like it changes every five seconds. i keep getting told conflicting things about my insurance and what order to do things in, and there’s so many things I feel like I’m expected to know but i don’t! I’ve been picking up my meds for months now and it’s different every time, and nobody ever tells me what I should be doing because they assume I know what I’m doing. I wish someone would write a guide with all the steps that I could look at instead so I didn’t have to sit in the waiting room sweating for hours and having no idea what’s happening. I know there are guides out there but this is a specific community pharmacy and it’s probably different. I’m so frustrated but I really don’t want to have a meltdown because I’m alone and I don’t want people to think I’m weird.

autism,whoisearth,2019/03/15,"Video Game Controllers - Autism and Fine Motor Skill Problems My youngest son has autism but has recently taken a liking to video games (6 years old) however due to his low muscle tone/fine motor development he can't actually use a controller effectively.  It can be improved on with training but all controllers are not equal and I'm curious for those who may have dealt with this already do you have a controller that has been the best?

I'm not opposed to buying an old system.  I've found he had most luck with an old Sega Genesis controller when playing at a game store and he really likes Sonic.  Ideally a USB controller so that we can play all different games on an emulator.",6.697890624999999,7.477166757812501,6.6906250000000025,75.591875,65.015625,9.8375,33.96875,9.827888789773867,3.3155906249999987,547,23,97,11,8,174,90,128,0.03,0.7040000000000001,0.266,0.9892,2,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,1,1,0,10,2,10,0,0,9,0,14,0,0,8,2,28,19,7,0,2,4,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,7,2,8,2,0,3,2,0,0,4,0,4,8,10,13,5,12,0,1,0,0,12,4,0,3,9,57,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.12087497747716967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13668879199597822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12998932649035005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8335549533188419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12941320964758904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358122591805569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12102897066362933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3899283958553173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185226701066344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07935148805566772,0.0,0.1223023566801413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698012594237988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07976539830996576
autism,JohnT62,2019/03/15,"What does it mean if a girl from out of town acts like this I am in 11th grade and met a girl from another town an hour away. I met her through a distance learning class. Well I didn't notice anything until the first day she met me in person. I was sitting and then they came in as well as the teacher. They visited our school and when the teacher was talking to me she had to say something and butted in then said something and smiled, raised her eyebrows. Then she got to talk to me. When she saw me on the screen she would compliment me a lot. Like she said ""I didn't know you wore glasses"" ""I like your glasses"". Then when I showed a heart sign with my hand she did it back. Then she complimented my shirts too. She doesn't do this to anyone else not even other girls. I added her on fb and she instantly accepted within half an hour. Then we went on a field trip together. When a girl from my class said something to me she butted in from across the room started saying something and smiling. Then on the ride she kept looking back and she would look back 3 times only to look right at me. When I caught her she stopped doing it. Then when I wasn't paying attention she walked by me said ""HI Steve"" and I had to look down bc shes 5'1 and I am 6'1 lol. She walked by said hi and smirked but couldnt look me in the eyes. Then she continued butting in to what I say to other girls and smiling in class after it.

autism,robsuth,2019/03/15,"Helping 4-yr-old with anger Hey folks, I'm just posting because I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do. My 4 year old lately has been learning about emotions at school, and his favourite is anger. Now he seems to be constantly angry, or on the verge of anger. He gets very mad transitioning activities, or when anyone corrects him on something (such as when his teachers say, no guns at school, play another game, when he's pretending to shoot people). 

I've been looking for tips with how to help him out of this - I can't imagine it's very nice to feel angry all the time, and I just want him to be happy and safe (when he's angry he will run into things or hit himself/others). Does anyone have any advice or has anyone gone through something similar?",6.471,5.7486216666666685,6.511833333333333,81.77175000000003,65.66666666666666,9.1,32.083333333333336,8.07648339933343,2.147333333333333,590,20,120,6,8,188,100,150,0.18600000000000005,0.698,0.116,-0.9287,0,0,2,2,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,1,10,9,4,0,4,0,11,0,0,1,2,22,20,13,0,1,6,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,4,7,0,1,4,3,0,2,2,5,0,0,3,3,8,4,23,13,2,21,0,1,1,0,15,8,0,5,10,68,12,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16490579749189305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475944057622801,0.17695472274724322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35399304188785835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287170911093196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842371601666126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823646068763232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14767896422208007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898270808850976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08532778717091033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08816771732351178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1796432326582147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2262263387564839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19036341132331075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14171201127711006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541607527180539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699372742437435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16162099913595493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13420104603372085,0.0,0.341578893992889,0.0,0.1536285536615544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598322617077061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11211357132297352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840261514929084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784817125995731,0.09953629135525016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10867292741406907

autism,jupiterjazz87,2019/03/15,"Questions about ABA Therapy Hi everyone! I know this topic has been discussed almost to death, but I’m currently undergoing rounds of interviews to become an entry level ABA therapist. I’ve done my research and seen the pushback from adults in the community &amp; I’ve read through all the posts I can find on this sub about your opinions- a lot of negative views but also some mixed views that basically say ‘it depends on the therapist’.

My question is then- what can I do for these children to make it a positive, beneficial experience? Things that my company won’t tell me about. I already know where my personal values lie eg. regarding physical touch and eye contact- I myself hate it in most situations and would never want to force that upon anyone. 

I would love to go into this being as informed as possible, because I often find the psych world to be a bit of echo chamber at times.
Thanks in advance !!!",5.442840236686388,7.356216360946746,6.4468639053254435,71.9962130177515,68.8224852071006,10.170414201183434,33.11834319526628,10.389873798559362,3.9517952662721902,731,34,122,21,13,243,121,169,0.075,0.8,0.126,0.9076,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,1,6,3,1,0,9,0,12,2,1,2,2,26,22,9,1,3,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,1,0,3,12,4,0,0,7,1,0,2,3,1,0,0,3,7,14,2,25,14,5,18,0,0,5,1,14,11,0,9,4,87,26,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15643399777424732,0.0,0.17239511627020604,0.12493086143541095,0.0,0.16926672167573756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923421604112464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523162182184712,0.1725351800317176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17055421470248944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598695811883836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14927703617392998,0.0,0.15281531830348044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28556857727928386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878469383969237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542371100108419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17171130483783945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13281455396658806,0.14099666251423745,0.0,0.1042795520661985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048821509752293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364072260597853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17611709227324707,0.1496177131808606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3500093030033828,0.0,0.15626450663697025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12423418814008486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17560033274222495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13654511539021832,0.14382844089399172,0.17865373568806406,0.3627721012999653,0.1037871084052156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910944390169774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214391923508014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2219515808844318,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,weedislif,2019/03/16,"my autistic friends nephew is the most amazing boy in the world. he is 11 years old, he has autism ADHD and split personality disorder. 
he has 2 personas.

when I first started babysitting him he was a challenge, I had 4 other kids to look after and they all had there own needs. 

but after working out strategies I found it's actually pretty easy, he can go on for hours about cars, and loves fortnite and the fortnite dances. 
Once he trusts you and his anxiety goes around you he gives the best hugs.

Honestly the reason I made this is because I was talking to my auntie and she had something negative connotations around autism, it's like somebody I told her everything bad about autism and nothing good. 

She seems scared for me like he was going to somehow find a way to hurt me, and when I said that he's a wonderful boy she seemed pretty shocked. 

After explaining to her that autistic kids are just like us and explaining how wonderful he was, she finally came around.

This boy has changed my perspective on autism and I hope that he can change other  people's perspective of autism.

autism,Zeethe,2019/03/16,"I don't have autism. My experience. Hi. I don't have autism.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two children, my three year old is severely autistic(destructive, licking biting smearing, ect), my four year old is mild(super clever, impossible to deal with). 

&amp;#x200B;

Wife is also autistic, just only found out. Honestly before the kids I had no idea what what autism even was. Often heard the term window licker without knowing the meaning as a child, now completely know the meaning and ramifications behind the term(youngest prefers radiators over windows). 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the worst part of it all is that you can't go to your usual friends to talk about it, they don;t understand, can't really expect them to because a year ago I wouldn't have a clue either, unless you've lived it, you don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I really struggle with is knowing if my eldest is being naughty or it's the autism and she needs support.

autism,Tableaucloth,2019/03/16,"People reacting oddly to you that have known you for a while. I have Asperger’s. 

Last year, I went back to my old school for a coaching course. The teachers and those that had previously knew me, treated me as though I was an idiot. 

Very few teachers clicked that I had matured from when I was younger, and this severely irritated me. I made a statement towards the new chicken pen outside, and as though I was a toddler, I was asked with a childish smile  “ well would you like to feed them? “ to which I acknowledged politely, and brushed off. Said teacher who used to know me as a child proceeded to tell others, whilst I was with her, that I wanted to feed the chickens outside. 

I was beyond embarrassed. 

I expected to be treated like a co-worker, but very few actually treated me as an adult. I know that anxiety and paranoia towards others can come with my condition, but I was wondering if anyone else experienced the same thing, and how they dealt/deal with this.

autism,Young-Master-Zero,2019/03/16,"Can anti-social personality disorder be comorbid with autism? I often hear misconceptions and stereotypes about the autistic spectrum. One popular misconception is that we are cold, calculating androids who don't feel anything and are basically sociopaths.

Sociopathy isn't even a diagnosis anymore (The correct term is Anti-social Personality Disorder)and on top of that, people on the spectrum have difficulties expressing their feelings outwardly to others.

But I'm wondering if it's possible for an autistic person to actually have ASPD. Is it possible or are the two inherently different to the point they can't be comorbid?

autism,fishparrot,2019/03/16,"Good resources for explaining shutdowns? Hello, I have been having a lot of what I think are shutdowns lately and they are causing problems. I want to explain what is happening to my mom but I can't, because when this happens, I can only communicate with single words or sometimes only affirmative/negative (yes/no or sounds) responses. When it happens, people press me more because I am usually articulate, which in turn makes it worse. Others say I sound irritated or mean, which I do not do on purpose because I have very little control over my affect. I understand what a shutdown is and how it effects me, but I need help explaining it to my mom and others who have never heard of such things.

autism,Fatihhhvisualsnow,2019/03/16,"Do you see dots, hear ringing and have light sensitivity? Do you see millions of dots moving in your vision(tv static/noise) 24/7? Then you may suffer from visual snow syndrome.

Other symptoms of visual snow syndrome are:

AfterimagesSeeing circles and starbursts around streetlightLight flashes in eyeBlue field entoptic phenomenon (worms in blue sky)Light sensitivitySound sensitivityTinnitus (earringing)Numbness and tingling

Visual snow appears most of the time after a trauma, panic attack or medication use/withdrawal.

According to research hyperexcitibility of the visual part of the brains are responsible for these problems. It has nothing to do with the eyes.

autism,charlie_hann,2019/03/16,"Calming an autistic family member down after a mass shooting (New Zealand)? I  have a high-functioning autistic brother that lives with my parents. He  has this problem where, after an active shooter incident gets widely  reported, he gets very **tense and agitated.**

He obsesses over the shooter's identity and looks up every minutiae of their life on [Heavy.com](https://heavy.com/) and Daily Mail. I feel like he takes it very personally when the news inevitably report that the shooter was **quiet, a loner, weird, and sometimes even has a confirmed autism diagnosis**.  He starts wailing and ranting about how he's just like the shooter,  that he has the dark thoughts too and that autism means it's his fate  that he'll go on a mass rampage as well.

If I'm not there in the house, he'll blow up my phone with calls talking about his **fantasies of who he's going to kill**  and where he's going to strike, to get back at all the bullies in his  life, and that he'll do it if I don't come back and be there for him. He  never has any sympathy for the victims, especially if it's a school  shooting - school was not a good time for him, he was tormented and made  fun of pitilessly by his peers. If the shooter got less than 25 kills  he'll mutter ""too bad he didn't get enough for a tactical nuke"" and, if  its something like this week's Christchurch, New Zealand shooting, he  celebrates their ""top score.""

We  haven't reported this to anyone outside our family. I think he just  feels as shocked and worried about the media reporting, and just wants  to be comforted. But, being unable to express himself adequately through  his Asperger's, the only way he can get us to meet his needs is through  attention-seeking behavior.

This time his reaction is very bad though. **The shooting this time happened right where we live, New Zealand**,  and it's all people are talking about. My parents called me back home  for the weekend because of how he is his reacting. He was fantasizing  again - saying that the best time to do a follow-up strike is at a  vigil, then people will really know they can never be safe. We have  locked him in his room, for his own safety, and as a precaution. **I can hear him right now yowling and banging against his dresser.**

**We  have him already going through CBT therapy, and doctors have him on  antidepressants and other medication. So I don't know what else can we  do?** The regular psychologist sessions we have set up for him  are very expensive, and I have to split part of my paycheck to help my  parents pay for them. But so far, counseling seems like total quackery:  it doesn't seem to have helped him at all.

Usually  after a week my brother calms down. He tearfully apologizes for his  outbursts, and tells us that he's just so jealous of the victims, or the  shooter who gets to suicide by cop. Every day living with autism and  knowing that he will never be normal and that no-one will ever love him  is pure pain, and he just wants to die so much. One of the e-mails he  sent to me in the past:

&gt;You  can gain victory only if you choose death for yourself because the  bullies actually make up our entire world. Because the second you choose  death, the world disappears into nothingness, the harassers, too, disappear into nothingness. Then, peace will come to you. Using my own  life energy, I sacrifice myself in order to deal a mortal wound to all  the hurtful people in the world. Remember me as a hero.

I just hope that things settle down to normal again.",4.291248781846028,6.406134580398162,4.779720451065013,81.94099651956009,72.26186830015314,7.750622302659058,29.177474592788528,8.52124585384065,2.3277463399693725,2743,113,495,49,55,871,300,653,0.112,0.797,0.091,-0.9154,3,0,1,10,0,1,116.0,10,3,4,4,35,29,6,1,41,0,44,8,0,6,10,91,86,46,7,13,17,5,2,4,0,8,7,3,3,1,28,36,0,1,13,2,2,9,12,14,1,2,9,6,59,15,78,64,12,78,1,1,1,1,90,36,0,10,34,336,87,9,0.0,0.0,0.07135815829085998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08069379336742967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049726606314032674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05112977356075511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1686827765689937,0.1221104279940723,0.13372654016415578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07673878522602119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14933489517245982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12597914188376486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04715872081118792,0.07538729776649768,0.0,0.0,0.07589082959982173,0.0,0.0,0.07484517957142657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06108544718732242,0.0,0.0,0.07555630315604693,0.0,0.04829749749391997,0.06614455017604108,0.12321969946690466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13786898533459765,0.0,0.07394705409838606,0.052239567816882236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2292246117760203,0.0,0.16623147787229556,0.061332669009583424,0.05848368263285001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06466302404306233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08241569585433292,0.0,0.09802651554175452,0.07725917708947314,0.07334900786466682,0.07262830833971412,0.0,0.08437490283195086,0.07828040614676386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16180102376484592,0.0,0.12056057779837755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15494824189494902,0.1428981353568618,0.0,0.19370863334526026,0.0,0.06140547008039651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0659969713561277,0.06919138905815846,0.04881062067726456,0.0,0.0,0.0796531186887149,0.0,0.0736644092600661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0537543146227595,0.054220278243748615,0.16919245758187826,0.21186990206478185,0.0,0.0,0.14329135116069558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04955049443267625,0.11122769937751373,0.07780874548380053,0.0,0.2435855614545132,0.0791858138506281,0.06980482161794421,0.1520842467242271,0.06384877223691338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996948112045788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04684489845188269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08283486882726925,0.12489443730661795,0.0,0.058150881091281435,0.0,0.1480101253672858,0.0,0.13313809422847322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05629417728400926,0.07232118404637597,0.0,0.05175731331854565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799854316697538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497990302122178,0.11754807969748693,0.06391331474471908,0.0,0.08362329481153351,0.0,0.04858012025541866,0.04685469814354547,0.07184363912412654,0.05805202971852023,0.17055601105164914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17591755436836296,0.06315537690515256,0.08053539684772132,0.241338759034786,0.08626047581494868,0.05804216935041255,0.1173108021854537,0.0,0.06574696535609831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07426064116605828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,r1ker,2019/03/16,"Toe walking I’ve been a “toe walker” since I was about eighteen months old. Even now, after months of corrective casts as a child and at-home physical therapy, I still find it the most comfortable way to ambulate and get around. 

When I was nine I was seen at Shriner’s Hospital for Kids in Shreveport, Louisiana. After my first consultation I was put into the casts and after six months of changing the sets every four weeks I was slowly brought down to a heel-and-toe pattern of walking. Now, thirteen years later, I’ve resorted back to it and am reminded all the while of its benefits - the release of tension, the comfort. 

DAE with HFA/Asperger’s toe walk? I’d like to know. I’ve had a hunch that the two are connected but neither my doctor nor my independent research in my later years have brought forth anything useful.

autism,grandma-shark,2019/03/16,"Toddler just diagnosed We took a “quiz” at my son’s 18m appointment. A few weeks later, someone called me and said it was actually part of a research study and we were invited to come in for an assessment. My husband and I had no concerns about our son (just thought he was a little behind his peers). Our pediatrician had no concerns either, in fact when I spoke with her, she was surprised they wanted us to do the study and said it was totally up to us. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we completed the study Thursday (they asked us a lot of questions and played with our son for a few hours and did an eye following test on a computer). Then the doctor told us that he had autism. We are so floored. We feel like something in us has died. I mean nothing has meaning right now. Everything I dreamed for him seems like it will never happen. 

I don’t want to offend anyone. This is so raw for me right now. I did not sleep last night.  Ok and maybe we are oblivious people, but it’s not like we saw an issue and then got a diagnosis and suspected it. We saw nothing unusual and we only went through with the evaluation because we felt we should and we’d laugh about it later. I feel like some random person just out of the blue knocked our world upside down. 

I am going to get a second opinion that’s not involved in a study. Just because a small part of me hopes that doctor is seeing what she wants so that it fits into her hypotheses. 

My main question for the group is how do I even being to profess this? How many opinions should I get on this? They have a 20 hour a week therapy school as the next part of the research study. The doctor is one of the leaders on autism in our area and she said “if I would have blinked, I would have missed it” meaning that the signs are all there, but are so subtle it would be easy for someone else to miss it. I stay home with him and can’t imagine him being away from me that much right now. He also usually takes a very short nap (always has) but he took a 3.5 hour nap after the assessment. I don’t know how he would handle 20 hours a week. Or is they crazy? Should he be in daycare to be socialized more or do the therapy school? I’m worried I’m going to make things worse by doing too much or not doing enough. Should I tell my friends about this? Will they want to exclude my son from play dates or parties?

Again I’m sorry if my wording is offensive to anyone. I love him no matter what, I just feel helpless powerless and scared for our future. If you made it this far, thank you for reading.

autism,workingoutmyfaults,2019/03/16,"ECE looking for advice for (probably) autistic child. I say probably because his parents are somewhere between denial and acceptance and doctors seem reluctant to diagnose until parents raise more concerns (this is a cultural matter that seems common in many Asian countries).
Anyway, 5 year old boy has severe difficulties in daily life. He is a sweet boy but he cannot control his impulses, doesn’t socialize with other children at all and most recently he has become very demanding (or strongly refusing) in certain matters.
I want to focus on one thing at a time and right now that is walking to the park with the class. We don’t have a school playground so we walk 10-20 minutes to various parks. Sometimes he walks perfectly fine while holding hands with a teacher, but other times (becoming more frequent and strong) he just flat out refuses to walk. He will fall to the floor, have a tantrum, kick off his shoes and scratch and bite. The big problem is the other kids always have to wait for him to calm down so we can walk together, so they miss out on their playtime or are late to come back for lunch. We usually end up having to carry him while he kicks and screams but I feel there must be a better way. 
Does anyone have good advice for dealing with this type of behavior?",6.736457461645749,7.559187945606697,6.521907949790799,76.68275034867506,64.94142259414228,9.553249651324967,35.59860529986053,9.558583805096642,3.4698901534170163,1025,47,176,19,15,322,159,239,0.078,0.797,0.125,0.8987,2,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,4,0,2,5,8,14,1,0,12,0,20,6,2,1,4,43,28,19,0,3,6,2,3,0,0,2,3,2,0,5,8,19,1,5,4,0,0,7,3,4,0,1,0,7,14,10,34,25,5,38,0,1,1,0,31,15,0,5,15,117,22,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2766833851861509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11779854063492122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09898984213162727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10885947827800654,0.0,0.08630046108020221,0.31270843243955004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252081805006116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219510130641735,0.0,0.0,0.1587840865472571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459536427590111,0.0,0.14369174062416096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14490407436061006,0.12388987034782177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253900213438654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07158262888256406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11874316665133985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15969842741006907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09999589238371008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188841132271786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14353092904899264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14855511063357815,0.0,0.09593227741574724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31439602400838995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30527529576951457,0.13546447417600707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397844346845711,0.0,0.0,0.1209009914488456,0.0,0.11258306341218162,0.0,0.1432775653365675,0.0,0.2577621219801006,0.0,0.15993510668471156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14431396238796673,0.0,0.0,0.14001749065085028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940535836542504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16510255603363055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15592062441839125,0.11681102806327134,0.08350233424146145,0.1123725919526576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09116718117958124
autism,Sentient-Jello,2019/03/16,"Is it worth seeking a diagnosis as an adult? Hello everyone, 
I’ll attempt to keep this short, but the title is basically the TLDR. 

I’m a 21 year old woman who has been in and out of psychiatric care from therapists to groups to psychiatrists and a couple of hospitalizations. I’ve been diagnosed with depression by multiple doctors as well as GAD and social anxiety, but I always felt like my doctors were missing something, and even my current doctor keeps saying, “I know there’s more to why you’re doing X, Y and Z” but I’ve never had any answers for him. I’m now studying to be a middle school teacher and part of my studies involves learning about children’s disabilities, and after learning about autism, I strongly feel that I am on the spectrum. I was non-verbal my first few years of life and didn’t emotionally respond to things normally, so much so that my parents and relatives jokingly referred to me as “the very serious baby”. I’ve spent my whole life desperately struggling to deal with things that are supposed to be easy. Just existing often feels like too much. In social situations I always felt like a field biologist observing apes—like I wasn’t one of them, and I had to carefully study what they did to be accepted. Every class, every sports team, summer camp, etc, I would show up one day and suddenly everyone had a friend or a group formed. It was like everyone had a meeting in the middle of the night to decide who would be friends with who and I was never invited.  Reading all these symptoms(at least for high-functioning autism)—they all sound like me. From the social problems, to the hypersensitivity, the emotional disregulation: all these symptoms that were never fully addressed by my other diagnoses fit so perfectly, but, being a female, and still being able to generally function, maybe I flew under the radar. 

So, now I’m an adult in college, and I just wanted to hear from other people who were diagnosed as adults and how it happened for you and if you think it’s worth pursuing a diagnoses. I’m not sure if anything can be done at this point, but I feel like it might finally give me some peace that I’m not a broken freak, and give me some direction on how I can handle the problems I still deal with every day (like feeling that being at school is too much to go, not being able to make phone calls and ask for help, not being able to plan or prepare, etc.). Also I’m just scared to actively bring it up.... Anyway, thank you to anyone that can help.

autism,dndynamite,2019/03/16,"Visual thinking? Can you describe how this works for you, personally? Like, it is constant? No words at all? What about during a conversation?  


Thanks in advance. I'm just trying to understand. I know it's not like this for everyone on the spectrum, but from my understanding, it's pretty common. Isn't it?

autism,Master_of_sum,2019/03/17,"Advice for parent - helping your kid make friends. Hi all,

My son, a great kid, is a 1st grader with autism. He is verbal, and in mainstream classes, but he struggles with some social interactions particularly amongst peers. Recently, he told me that he has only one friend at his school (someone he met recently) and that before this he was completely friendless and alone, which breaks my heart. From those who have autism themselves, or parents, do you have any tips on helping your child make friends?

(Note: We tried ABA in the past for close to a year, but ended it as of last October after we felt he was receiving little benefit).

Thanks in advance for suggestions.",6.872500000000002,8.196052583333334,6.091666666666669,78.10500000000003,64.83333333333334,9.0,33.33333333333333,9.188382445141503,2.982333333333333,530,22,91,9,8,161,91,120,0.071,0.777,0.152,0.8764,2,1,0,0,0,0,23.0,2,3,0,1,0,7,0,1,4,0,8,1,1,2,1,16,14,7,0,0,3,3,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,7,8,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,5,1,9,6,15,9,2,17,0,0,0,0,32,7,0,2,7,52,16,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16163273404672426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17131063166705113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11248168602999052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14074824070743358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17342494228550084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465005349587614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588156059610164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3833765709836176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823605919590344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19600679141833333,0.22173618030856987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13482788735268902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657801684662303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081944926129785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208332059117927,0.12579864268446053,0.0,0.0,0.3673273615595419,0.0,0.15789865045331591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3266367489329661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16739960440578516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16861048802182096,0.14014788482440327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17291816325652806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15228353247125812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1580524286024953,0.0,0.11229975058829617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10651597846740783

autism,DisneyandDogs,2019/03/17,"Breakups and Autism I was recently broken up with out of the blue. When I thought of my future, she (my now ex-girlfriend) was always part of it. I honestly thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her. We were in a long distance relationship (albeit the first two months of our relationship) and saw each other about every month, and always talked, texted, wrote letters, facetimed, etc. She just can't do the whole long distance thing anymore. She still wants me in her life but she wants some space for now. She was/is everything; she was my major reason for my living and she was one of the most (if not the most) major parts of my life. I'm also not really close with many other people.

Do you think that me being autistic makes the breakup experience different for me compared to allistic and neurotypical folks? Anyone have any similar experiences or advice?

autism,Cward12213,2019/03/17,"What do you wish your parents had done differently? Hello All -

I’ve been browsing this sub on and off for the past few months.  My daughter was diagnosed with ASD in October of 2018, she will be 3 this July. I am (generally) neurotypical although I do relate to her on a few things, such as not finding social engagement very rewarding in and of itself. I see a lot of references on here to feeling alone in the world and having major relationship issues with parents. I know there are no universal right answers for raising any child, whether ASD or NT, but I’m wondering if any of you would be willing to share more with me on what you feel went wrong in your relationships with your parents and what they maybe could have done differently? My greatest fear for her is that she feels alone and misunderstood. I spent most of my life feeling that way and can’t bear the thought of her experiencing the same. I would be grateful for any feedback!",7.359888268156425,7.313915854748608,7.27815083798883,74.76370670391064,63.63687150837989,10.511955307262571,35.77709497206703,10.125756701596842,3.4822375418994405,754,32,141,15,10,241,117,179,0.098,0.795,0.106,0.3733,5,2,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,6,1,1,3,5,0,1,6,0,21,2,0,0,1,34,33,12,0,5,5,4,4,0,0,4,2,0,0,1,9,10,0,0,10,0,1,1,3,2,0,0,8,6,22,3,27,17,9,15,0,0,1,0,22,11,0,5,2,109,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741146074898523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2699733774477512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10565730614124534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343154301948256,0.0,0.2765200932466091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2708456532782832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14891166053929306,0.2676466037943308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209501633988417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381214978460889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272687553873812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347086509560422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125049692585238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329465037965276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10562711169536244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44082113244088394,0.0,0.1263270299426277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841527025939252,0.0,0.11301184470934132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10545244112744187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13489705015098402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791630955969865,0.0,0.0,0.10505779295046057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091887635132456,0.0,0.10503994846653653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1226742184348055,0.0,0.0,0.15217666930952214,0.0,0.14350972944798762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880114418075416,0.14468559934631312,0.0,0.0

Is anyone able to educate me, please, as to how the colour purple relates to autism ?

Reason I ask is I read a lot of websites for autism services and help which contain the colour purple on their name.

autism,nikolas-heck,2019/03/17,"my mom made fun of my flapping so I substituted it for hitting myself in the face [vent?] I'm not diagnosed with autism, but I show a lot of the signs &amp; I highly suspect that I have it, so I hope it's okay for me to post here. 

As the title says, my mom makes fun of me for stimming because she thinks ""only autistic people can do it,"" and she won't consider that I could be autistic because I was assigned female at birth (I'm transmasculine). She was always making snide comments about how it was weird and I looked like a freak, so I stopped. 

Recently though I was watching one of my favourite musicals and I noticed that instead of flapping, I was just... hitting myself in the face. Which is a lot more harmful than flapping, but my mom didn't comment on it (although idk if she saw). 

I told my friend about this (my friend doesn't know that I've been wondering if I have autism) and they said ""That sounds like an autism thing,"" so maybe I have it and I just have learned to hide it well enough that I won't get a diagnosis? :/

Idk basically my point is that I'm tired of my mom making fun of me for things that help me calm down/express my emotions and I wish I could stop punching myself in the face when I get excited :/",3.896301176470587,4.624772375999999,4.635694117647058,88.0197294117647,71.24000000000002,7.48235294117647,28.70588235294117,7.5105763829236425,1.4660635294117643,954,35,207,10,17,307,130,250,0.08800000000000001,0.7090000000000001,0.203,0.9877,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,1,0,14,15,0,0,10,1,21,5,3,5,0,33,41,19,0,6,7,4,0,2,2,2,2,3,0,0,20,7,0,2,5,1,0,0,5,3,1,1,11,6,42,12,23,23,4,13,0,0,3,0,17,7,0,6,7,145,62,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019384434925699,0.1327399367309407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1493623711769306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19562912634830226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12434544861944367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13780767890236284,0.0,0.12658596322274882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1893024188048592,0.0,0.12801322574019164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08211611985299765,0.12943893416104985,0.0,0.12168044205966046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0673284964537397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11970475891021272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287785734062316,0.0,0.0,0.2083078742937577,0.0,0.11592227603509972,0.2453298735846337,0.0,0.1230781350511034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5739306674500155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13947887036106082,0.0,0.0,0.08301619856875939,0.09317465833177192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493326635648885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11581190026366545,0.0,0.11733107125156905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096421245485076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11653541823605035,0.0974251649129589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048483130601583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16278089475363586,0.07849969953879565,0.12036581833778184,0.0,0.0,0.14080765045455218,0.0,0.117063910383219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110151537210411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14088088157301107,0.0,0.13285727234451775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,S-Milk_A-Man,2019/03/17,"I am testing my child April 5 2019 and not sure what to expect. Hi everyone I'd like to start out by apologizing for any grammar errors you may come across. Also sorry if I offend anyone I do not mean to.

So for the last year I have been concerned about my child hitting his milestones. He is coming up on 18 months and has not ever pointed, waved, or clapped before among other things. We have taken online M-Chat exams and he has a risk for Autism according to them. I am extremely nervous since I do not know to much about Autism and what to expect. 

So my question to all of you who live with it or have a child is what should I expect with this diagnosis? What are things I can do to help him excell? What are things you wish your parents would have known to help you out a bit more? 

I appreciate any and all input from you guys.",4.3615080213903745,4.8356828941176495,5.083155080213904,86.14510695187168,70.05882352941177,7.593582887700535,24.86631016042781,7.348242739294969,0.958176470588236,652,16,138,6,11,211,107,170,0.083,0.8370000000000001,0.08,0.5389,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,1,6,1,1,6,6,1,2,4,0,20,0,0,0,4,34,28,11,0,7,7,1,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,4,12,12,0,0,4,0,0,2,4,3,0,0,2,0,22,3,25,22,5,15,0,0,0,0,23,7,0,5,7,103,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14688303315816525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24980753909683104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12842825857780352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1562919835410266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005230740073156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3164356241482836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661425193566933,0.0,0.1755071853516662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1818649011506056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24622394758932697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094174086507704,0.14971780709359106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08973322880107228,0.0,0.16218640477292587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000734720901368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14660583804951974,0.0,0.13502060614137415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20394685453429093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1736301186161085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20575551736386327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15193599821030626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056066079944273,0.13000451899651258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17310939477926354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3660720444120557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112145999035838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13047585296372033,0.0,0.0,0.1182792301332489
autism,Squatcobbler86,2019/03/17,"Need help working with an autistic adult So my job is to be an aide for a guy with autism. 

His main problems are that he gets very stubborn. When he gets upset, nothing can calm him down except for leaving the situation. Ive tried breathing, counting to ten, but all wants to do is sit and be still.

 Also he gets triggered by other people with disbilites. He says ""I hate this autisic life."" I tell him about my.adhd, how I wanna help but I sound like a broken record sometimes

He wants his own job. I've told him that he has to learn calming skills. He says yes but then does it again.

He's a smart passionate guy. How do I get through to him when hes mad like that? 

Any help is appreciated.",1.0785000000000018,3.455218921428571,2.0667857142857144,95.82946428571432,84.78571428571428,4.357142857142857,21.607142857142854,5.602791699666715,-0.06257142857142872,539,18,117,3,16,169,93,140,0.123,0.6679999999999999,0.21,0.9479,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,2,9,11,3,1,6,1,12,3,1,3,1,19,21,11,0,5,4,0,0,2,0,0,1,3,0,3,6,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,1,3,14,6,16,18,3,7,0,0,0,1,25,1,0,0,7,69,20,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19988695866926925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13300780030241754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11310479692522132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455496748206125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3475859315160106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32937024698027834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16420873507023845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33444678680520795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3300982318131355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761111908680973,0.0,0.0,0.11747828598887428,0.16251324772156886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233258011065515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15959063309852278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11530686900716415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15914787957004062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2645321723874019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18695311728472355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16449690500291753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13282512082416525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14537293052671552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15892798615995973,0.0,0.11292185362207012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13723323062925066,0.1962022812920071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12108453980499607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Crystal-Child,2019/03/18,"How do I stop hating the world? Now relax, the title isn’t serious. I don’t hate the world. Not even the people in it. But I’ve grown more and more resentful of it with age, and if I keep heading this direction I’m afraid that I might, sooner or later. 

Because of my autism, and other factors that my autism may or may not have contributed to, I’ve had trouble fitting in as long as I can remember. 

As early as in kindergarten, the personnel saw me as the black sheep. I was eventually put in special ed up until 9’th grade. 

Now that I’m 20 and living by myself, life is very lonely. I have a so much trouble making new friends, and I can barely get a job or an education. Everything seems so confusing and hopeless. I’ve often thought about killing myself, but I made a whole hearted promise to at least endure life, because we all die eventually. 

I have very little going for me, other than my very specific set of artistic skills that I probably won’t be able to make money off of anyway. My biggest fear is to end up a lonely recluse with a beer belly with no friends and family with a dead-end job, dying and nobody remembering me. Like my dad.

autism,rattstaad,2019/03/18,"tips for passing as neurotypical better? I consider myself pretty good at looking NT (I don't flap my hands in public or have big meltdowns or anything very often anymore) but apparently other people can tell there's something ""off"" about me. I'm not sure what it is, maybe it's something about my mannerisms. Is there anything you guys know that can help me seem ""less autistic""? Are there certain things that are a giveaway that a person is autistic?

autism,NoCommunication7,2019/03/18,"first (and probably only) post here, how to hide autism? Hello! so i am a teen with a small-amount of autism, I am very posh, done my homework on many a subject, well manured, etc, you can see for yourself by looking at my post history.

&amp;#x200B;

But, a few days ago i met one of my brothers friends, i hadn't met him before, not did i really want to, it was serendipity, nothing else, i simply introduced myself ""Hello, don't think we've met, my names NoCommunication7"" and if i want to, i will go into my occupations and hobby's, but i didn't this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up not really talking to him, my brother was mostly talking to him and i didn't want to come off as being rude or interpretive, so i announced my goodbyes and walk off to do some other stuff, that was it, nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday i heard my brother talking to my mom like ""So that friend of mine asked me about NoCommunication7, said he was a bit weird, i simply told him why"" 

&amp;#x200B;

This, this is not cool, how did he detect it? like how? there was Nothing to detect it from, it was not by my dress as i was dressed in my best with nothing wrong, and i can't trust my brother either because he spills the beans on every little thing, i'm working on hiding it, and he's making it public!

It will ultimately come down to our decision. Like any other parent of an autistic child, we worry about his social skills. We worry about him being left out or being left behind. Do any parents have advice for us? Especially parents who have gone through this. Should we keep him in special ed or will the challenge of general ed help him?

I think because I've been working out, my neck has gotten bigger. So I started to find I often can't stand wearing crew neck t-shirts anymore and I need to wear shirts that are looser around my neck. That's a pain, but I bought some new shirts to adapt to it. But now I'm starting to feel like things are touching my neck even if they're not. I get really touchy when my partner accidentally touches me in a way that makes my shirt ride up and touch my neck.

autism,askalotaquestions,2019/03/18,"I played with a sociopath I don't know if this is the correct sub for this.

 I have been playing ball with a sociopath at work for way too long. He's the sickest path i've ever met. On the first day: I saw him, he saw me, and almost immediately it started. I was prepared to put in my two weeks right then until i talked to another coworker, ill call her anne. Anne is about the closest thing i have to a friend, she's a good person, but i could tell that she was charmed by this path and i din't want her to get hurt. So i didn't quit, i thought i needed to look out for her;that i could protect her. I tried to tell her early, but she said manipulation and lies don't always mean a sociopath (she has done some research on the subject). I knew I was right, but i didn't have enough evidence for normal folk. I've been getting hit by this sociopath for months now, and i've been losing every round. I'm absolutely drained, a complete mess, i have barely slept the last few days because im too wound up. but yesterday i finally convinced her.

autism,Phoenix_Magic_X,2019/03/18,"Today I have an appointment to begin the process of being diagnosed I've suspected I'm autistic for two years now but stuff keeps happening and I never got around to trying to get a diagnosis. But today I'm finally going to see a GP to talk to her about starting the process. 

I feel like I should be scared, feeling like I'm going to get this label that will ruin my whole life. But instead I feel like having this one word attached to my identity makes everything clear. It will open doors to the appropriate services. If anything, this could make everything come together and I could actually be a functional human being. And if not at least I'll understand why.

autism,StimSensory,2019/03/18,"StimSensory: UK stim toy store run by an autistic person. [StimSensory Ltd](https://www.stimsensory.co.uk/) is an online store that sells stim toys for neurodiverse adults at affordable prices. 

The company was started by myself, an autistic young adult, after I got frustrated by the lack of affordable stim toys available in the UK. Most stim toys were aimed at children, were very expensive, and/or were intended for sensory rooms rather than stimming on the go. Many companies were also only focused upon one method of stimming, rather than catering for every sense.

I set up StimSensory so that people could access stim toys for every sense, at affordable prices. If you’d like to read more, you can read about the company [here.](https://www.stimsensory.co.uk/about-us)

Whilst the business is still new and small, I hope to increase our stim toy options to offer stim toys for everyone who stims, such as those with ADHD or trichotillomania. 

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to comment.

i am a 17 year old female who grew up with speech apraxia, and home schooled. my mother recently told me about how my childhood doctor always told her she thought i was autistic, because speech apraxia is usually linked with autism ( from what i've heard ). it has almost given me relief with who i am hearing that, even though i haven't been tested yet. iv'e always been so bad at picking up social cues and what people mean when they talk about topics. i usually just stay quiet and people always call me boring and weird for it. i always thought something was wrong with me and it was my doing. could i even be tested at an older age? how do they test for that? my whole life i was home schooled and that was primarily because of my apraxia. i didn't talk till i was eight. my doctor said i would never speak in my life. i have severe anxiety, but i don't know if that's because i was home schooled my whole life. i've read about symptoms about autism but i don't know if its because i was home schooled. it could be a mix. my fear is over my teen years iv'e gotten better at masking my symptoms, i don't know if a doctor would say i don't have autism, even if i do. is it wrong for me to have so much anger for my mom trying to keep this from me? from everyone in my family?  could it be that i've had such a hard life without any help because my mother was ashamed of having a child like me, that she would rather bury me and watch me struggle? any advice would help me, thanks.",2.8576205787781315,4.375981347266883,3.5278379421221864,91.92672797427656,74.7556270096463,5.876321543408362,22.729389067524124,6.152001189255117,0.3043570675241156,1193,32,254,7,25,376,143,311,0.134,0.825,0.041,-0.9774,0,0,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,2,1,18,14,1,3,6,0,42,9,0,3,2,41,57,20,0,12,9,3,1,1,0,4,9,8,4,1,19,11,0,1,7,1,0,1,9,9,0,1,21,10,48,5,30,26,3,23,0,0,1,0,26,8,0,5,14,176,67,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784552917400215,0.0,0.0,0.0803955917906598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26722006067241416,0.0,0.0,0.1091954986091044,0.0,0.06141915091903347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703609022691882,0.2447103156118439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710071139458102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819817575882581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19230733232610744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465306997880797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15908594145099422,0.0,0.0,0.07671743888613011,0.0,0.0,0.07568721109414578,0.09034492497937917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719211661825436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09048901251371518,0.0,0.10762904443847356,0.0,0.3221366620390177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07136256039774368,0.0,0.0,0.13237050928187444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268356491153833,0.03922405503118073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745581747582397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09403088185085126,0.0,0.0,0.05902000581494014,0.0,0.061922098101365064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424744793683349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132145935964542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030848578762632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792734886954892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07637109333975732,0.06384725327142747,0.0,0.3250179458580095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09070118500956216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184224010190505,0.06802671040302391,0.061808669573153924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085575002654521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08393315268377421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07566932025023806,0.16689736780872072,0.0,0.12906291143266327,0.0,0.07391726086734304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07888133312887798,0.12747743713601287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15343487777226025,0.0,0.05450943923394574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17684904453227004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1792745985486228,0.0,0.07739357068490849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228133640359013,0.17556193479005613,0.0,0.10340408104732783

autism,wildething1998,2019/03/19,"I was diagnosed autistic as a child, and through intensive therapy managed to overcome most of it, but I still feel weird Most people that meet me today have no idea that I’m autistic. When I was 3 I was put on the spectrum and my parents immediately started doing everything they could to help me out. I had all kinds of therapists visiting me throughout the week, all for different things, and I had a therapist at school that specifically focused on school related issues. With the help of these therapists I managed to excel at school, but I still had no idea how to interact with other people. 

I continued having no idea how to socialize until grade 11. This was the year where I got my first girlfriend and that made me feel like I was a normal person for the first time. 

Now I’m in 3rd year university and the added pressure of school is really getting to me. My mask that I’ve built for myself over the years is starting to crumble and I feel insecure. Like at any moment I could have an outburst and lose all my friends.

autism,samuelmarcas,2019/03/19,"I’m Autistic and I work at Starbucks and sometimes it’s really hard I don’t have the option to disappear when it gets to be too much, so I’m completely drained by the time I have to go home at the end of a shift. 

I don’t know how to explain what I need to my manager and I’m scared I’ll get fired if I ask for accommodations because I won’t be “meeting the needs of the business”. She already doesn’t like me because my stress causes me to get frequently sick. I’m on my next to last warning. I get written up for things no one else really does. 

I have to go hide in the bathroom when I feel a meltdown coming on. I think they’re catching on that my bathroom breaks are actually, catch my breath and calm down breaks. 

I had a meltdown at work once. I broke down. It was embarrassing. I’m glad it wasn’t a bad one. 

I want to feel better. I want to do better. I don’t want to quit because I like what I do but this is really hard?

Do any other working Autists have any advice for how to manage this better? Maybe how to bring up accommodations to my manager without saying and doing things wrong to make her fire me? I don’t know how to make this better on my own.

autism,Cygnus875,2019/03/19,"Dealing with shutdowns in school My daughter, 6, is high functioning. She is in first grade. Just this week, finally, she got approved for an IEP. They mentioned that in school and during the evaluations they witnesses many shutdowns. She has them at home during homework as well. They are almost always associated with reading and writing, which she struggles with the most. Once this happens, she is unable to do anything, even tell you her name.

We will be having her IEP meeting soon, and I want to go in prepared. How can we help her with these shutdowns, and how can we tell when they are real and when she is just being defiant. She can be very stubborn anyway so I don't know how to tell when she is doing it on purpose, if ever.

What are some ways to help her through this that they can implement at school? What works for those of you who have these, or worked when you were her age?

autism,CuckSlayer1984,2019/03/19,"Question/Advice about 15 month toddler behavior - not responding to name/lack of eye contact Hello everyone,

Within the past 2 weeks, my son, who would previously respond to his name semi-regularly has now seen a precipitous drop in response (now may respond by looking in my direction and give eye contact every 20th time his name is called). He may respond more frequently (like every 10th time) if I say ""hey, buddy"" or if I say ""hey, *name*, look"". But other than that, it seems he has withdrawn from his name recognition. He will still bring my wife and me books he wants us to read to him and he will hand us his toys he wants to share. He also will play peek-a-boo (him actually covering his head with the blanket and then pulling it down and smiling). So, he does exhibit some normal behaviors but the lack of response to his name and lack of eye contact is worrying us. I have reached out for early intervention with my hospital and we are waiting on the paperwork to arrive so we can fill it out and have the specialists review it to determine if he should be admitted. In the meantime, I guess I have two questions:

1. From the community's experience with autism, does my son sound autistic?
2. While we wait for the early intervention process, are there any ""home therapies"" we can do with him to maybe counteract these early signs?

Thank you for any guidance.

autism,chromecrank,2019/03/19,"Autism and lethargy I'm mom to a bright 11 yr old boy on the spectrum, high functioning. I'm trying to understand his lack of energy and enthusiasm for well, pretty much everything. From eating to playing outside... it doesn't matter how fun the activity, he doesn't want to do it. I've read about autism fatigue, but I don't think this is what's going on b/c he's also very lethargic at school and at large. He's had so many tests done that it's doubtful this is physiological. Is this typical for many kids/young adults w/ ASD? Could it be depression or fear that keeps him disengaged? I don't want to force anything on him but I want him to experience more of life.",1.5611111111111136,3.9955799259259273,3.391111111111112,86.78000000000004,83.07407407407408,6.85925925925926,22.333333333333336,8.021203637495839,1.271355555555556,530,18,110,11,15,177,90,135,0.2,0.7240000000000001,0.076,-0.9438,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,0,5,8,0,2,3,0,12,3,0,1,0,17,21,9,0,5,3,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,10,3,1,1,2,2,0,1,4,4,1,0,2,1,7,4,17,17,3,8,0,2,1,0,10,6,0,2,1,62,17,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15302791249530187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15747028892448994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15278278270830126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16481527615896702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1958243783775127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19580571299935626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171979095396216,0.1871836061050193,0.0,0.21532952813024436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875244278089627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021788976014963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17008665910253995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13516092159654147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3880113909764956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.224114696240392,0.0,0.0,0.1406692186116271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20079670456925253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19467859431133072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19140851966450814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19366323269248514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12261366966337565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12991866263178364,0.0,0.0,0.1992091105402918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15788934754527206,0.3386014819957835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720526865170416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Loud_Snort,2019/03/19,My daughter was diagnosed at 18 months and has struggled with her development. She’s now 6 and today her teacher sent me and my wife a video of her reading site words. I’m so proud of her and how far she has come I’m so proud of her and her hard work and so thankful for the amazing teachers and educators she has surrounding her. I’ve been crying tears of joy for most of the day. MY LITTLE GIRL CAN READ! her teacher also said if we can curb a couple other behavioral issues she won’t need to be in a moderate/severe class anymore. I never thought I would be told that. I’m sorry if this post is too much or not supposed to be here but I didn’t know where else to put it. Lurking on this sub has helped so much as a father and understanding her way of thinking. ,2.0056607142857166,3.7332483875000047,3.6171428571428565,89.48500000000001,77.625,6.321428571428572,23.92857142857143,7.1686216300943375,0.8467946428571431,602,20,130,7,14,200,105,160,0.06,0.857,0.083,0.7686,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,0,3,10,6,0,1,6,0,15,1,0,1,1,27,28,19,0,4,5,3,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,5,11,0,1,4,3,0,3,4,1,0,0,7,2,21,5,16,16,3,18,0,0,0,0,22,8,0,4,5,90,26,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14262976453781925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1768794104855206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15363632406422226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973454956841092,0.19591367981577976,0.11502368415379023,0.0,0.0,0.1810257272423699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14899202231967024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597703031242514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11954703995805176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861554146022228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098018786935863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17875773269211515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1423605961238298,0.0,0.2622216718654039,0.13224735642023586,0.13755773034372726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17081399228729272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17929520162984322,0.0,0.0,0.3568048684075136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1696556574437902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20148944451103507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19965289016115775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18645450231472335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16420455620693455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428214989041385,0.0,0.14159328785791364,0.0,0.0,0.1690588978373445,0.1704250517106916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18567297996058427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14156923767488602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12984395924366615,0.0,0.0,0.12669768444968987,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,CaptainBeefFart98,2019/03/19,"Is this a symptom of autism/anxiety? When I'm feeling anxious and going around and around in my head I will start unconcsiously saying out loud phrases that have nothing to do with what I'm thinking. For instance, I might be thinking of what I need to do that day and kind of going in circles repeating what I need to do, but on the outside I'm saying stuff like ""But you know what dude?"" or ""And it takes a lot of stuff"" or ""Dude you have to understand"" or ""Okay, well if you think that's gonna work"". I mean it can literally be anything, and it can be totally unrelated to what I'm thinking about or it can sometimes be vaguely related. It also doesn't feel like it's coming from me. It feels lile the thoughts are just popping into my head like someone is putting them there or something. This might be a symptom of some kind of psychotic disorder which I know I have one amd am going to the doctors to hopefully get diagnosed soon. I'm worried that they are going to misdiagnose me or not really care enough to dig deep into evaluating me because my way of thinking is very unusual, but this place is really shitty I've been there before. I just want a good doctor who will explain to me why I do the things I do. I can tell something is wrong but I'm not self aware or smart enough to notice what it is. But that's irrelevant. I should ask the schizophrenia sub about this.

autism,CorvusCorona,2019/03/19,"Reddit supports ABA therapists... Unfortunately came across someone in r/askreddit telling of their experience as an ABA therapist. Of course someone who likely has autism disagreed with the practice and was downvoted. Why on earth is that barbaric therapy still allowed to exist? And why is it that when we decry it, we're ignored or worse yet, told we're wrong? If someone of a different ethnicity pointed out something was racist, you'd likely agree or at least consider what they said if you were a good person. But no, I guess autistic people don't know what's good for them.

autism,instaspeccie1,2019/03/20,"Advice for conflicting access needs? (preferably from other autistic people)(xposted to r/Aspergirls)  I am autistic and I co-lead a small neurodiversity club with another autistic person, let’s call them Z.

Z  is outgoing, friendly, loud, likes to stim and infodump, and has  difficulty focusing on a task and difficulty refraining from  interrupting people.

I’m quiet, don’t  present a lot of emotion externally, sensitive to sound and motion, and  need to focus without distractions on a task or I’ll get very  overwhelmed.

Recently, after every club  meeting I have a sensory meltdown. This is because Z continuously  interrupts me to infodump about unrelated things. When they get excited  about these things they often yell, whine, or talk in a “baby voice.”   (Not sure how else to describe it sorry. It not only is very frustrating  to me, but it causes sensory overload which almost always is enough to  cause a meltdown.

I recognize that  interrupting, infodumping, and issues regulating voice volume are  autistic traits, and I want the club to be a safe space where Z doesn’t  have to stifle their autisticness. But my sensory needs are also an  autistic trait and I think the club should also be accessible for my  sensory needs.

I’m not sure if it’s  right of me to ask Z to try to be quieter and more conscientious. Z is  also very sensitive to criticism and has blocked people on FB/kicked  people out of the club/accused people of being ableist before for  criticizing them.

We are co-presidents of this club. There are no superiors or other officers.

Anyone have any advice?",7.004566787003611,8.914957425992784,7.7883953068592024,63.89205144404336,64.9927797833935,11.171768953068593,35.510649819494574,11.10651602901591,4.7433192779783395,1265,60,189,39,20,422,160,277,0.119,0.8,0.081,-0.8894,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,1,0,5,0,10,11,1,2,12,0,23,0,0,3,2,44,34,22,0,8,10,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,0,1,13,14,0,4,2,5,0,1,7,4,0,0,0,6,17,7,34,28,3,15,0,2,0,0,12,9,0,7,6,131,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2440946245708865,0.0,0.0,0.12506569894816102,0.0,0.0,0.2996388073166221,0.10392380638228024,0.0,0.0,0.0849338318890712,0.13096476070575108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08733046379056784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11676127011352308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07613568351237872,0.0,0.10627763360286377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12753318416353007,0.0,0.0,0.25660600515706355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043349121697992,0.1404916344566755,0.0,0.12905136356760494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523060003182463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09649464542298727,0.0,0.13050642358654893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13035938790590712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277150264924588,0.0,0.06101807013037836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10618244920321322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3704363791287849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09498933690224494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3463497391497737,0.1090547151608709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233201230432678,0.0,0.0,0.10666083942156092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13981128945761573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354267495329943,0.0,0.0,0.10038699179328577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1659512310519458,0.0800285672061649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08479645419884514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30915781974035234,0.07366713007992512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12039566842179154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,mickymuis,2019/03/20,"Did I consciously started stimming? Hello. I'm currently in the diagnosis process for ASD. When my therapist asked me if I stim, at first my answer was 'no'. However while watching my behavior more closely the last two weeks, I noticed I do a lot of things that might be considered stimming, stroke one finger with the other repetitively, lick my lip (I know), touch my mouth/face. The moment I become consciously aware of it I stop.

According to my mother I did some of those things in early school (I'm now 31 btw): rocking, fidgeting, tapping and making irritating noises. Teachers didn't really like that of course and I was strongly encouraged not to do it :)

As an experiment, I consciously started rocking sideways on some music two weeks again. It immediately felt 'good'. After doing this a couple of times, I was almost immediately addicted to it. It just 'happens' now, rocking back and forth or sideways, with or without music, sometimes even in public transport. It feels awesome, my fingers start tingling, I become happy, start yawning excessively and even started crying on two occasions. It feels sort of liberating, but at the same time really weird because I took the initiative at some point.

I'm really puzzled by what is happening to me. Can this actually be considering stimming? Did I repress my need for this for so long? What happens if NTs stim, does it also make them feel good? What does this say about me? Anyone else has such an experience?

autism,BuffBeaver_93,2019/03/20,"Transitioning into Career Hi everyone, I am new to this forum and Reddit in general. I stumbled across this forum and I have enjoyed reading many of the postings here, so I figured I would post something because I would like input from people that have been or are in my situation. 

First, a little background information will most likely be of use. I am a 25 M and I am graduating from a university with my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. School has been incredibly difficult for me due to the required interactions with others, inconsistent schedule and my inability to communicate effectively with my peers. I have learned some coping mechanisms at school that have helped greatly such as departing from the room upon feelings of overstimulation and ensuring I have my electronics and chargers with me at ALL times. 

In 2015, I managed to get a job at a company that produces chemical processing plants. Initially I worked in the production area assisting with assembling various skids of chemical processing equipment, painting, general labor, etc. In the winter of 2016, I was offered an internship since I was pursuing my engineering degree, which I happily accepted. Over the past 3 years, I have worked my way up the ladder, received many raises in my pay and have learned an incredible amount of information. This is when things begin to go sour, though. A few months ago, the company that I’ve been working for for years told me they will not be extending an offer to me for full time work. I was absolutely devastated. I had multiple meltdowns and for a long time, I was depressed. Until I got a phone interview with a different company.  

I talked to the engineering supervisor on the phone a few Thursdays ago and he seemed pleased with the information I gave him and my experience, so he asked me to come into the office. I excitedly accepted and went in the next Friday. The interview (in my opinion) felt wonderful. I talked about the subject I am incredibly passionate about, we discussed wages, benefits packages, schedule, etc, etc. I showed my wife the benefits package and we began discussing insurance. Here comes the real kicker. That Monday after the interview at 10:13am, I receive an email stating that the company decided to NOT hire me. Again, crushed, battered and discontent with myself. The question remains: why?

If you’re still with me, I appreciate your dedication to reading this post. I truly am in search of an answer, because I cannot understand it myself. I dedicate myself fully and do everything in my power to be the best engineer that I can be, but to no avail. Many of my colleagues have jobs lined up or are receiving countless interviews. Do people know that I have an autism? Are they judging me for being different? I’ve been told that I need personality, but I can’t control it. I’ve been through behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, several psychiatrists, I am medicated and I usually can control my meltdowns. However, I cannot successfully land a job beyond the one that I’ve had since 2015. I do lack social skills such as emotional connections, eye contact, general discussions and creating meaningful relationships. Additionally, I have strict routines and refuse to travel. However, these topics don’t get brought up in interviews so why can I not get hired? I graduate in May and want to have a job ready for when I’m done and the job market is apparently quite plentiful now, but I can’t even get an email back from these companies. How have you guys successfully been employed? Any advice is welcome and appreciated.

autism,newcrystalgem,2019/03/20,"My mom told me I was autistic at 19 and it changed my life (Rant) I wasn’t sure where to post so apologies if this is the wrong place. I’m on mobile so again sorry for formatting. 
I have always been shy and considered awkward by everyone, including myself. I never went out of the way to talk to people in public school and my parents openly said I was a “homebody” compared to my more-outgoing sister. I had one best friend and would frequently get in long-term relationships and get severely attached. I knew I had “quirks”, but just always assumed everyone was like that.
So then comes college. I move about an hour away to a big school (I came from a very small town). The first year was okay, I had issues with my roommate and ended up moving to a dorm by myself, which probably didn’t help much with my anxieties. I didn’t make a single friend and spent much of the time in my room.
I go back the second year and got a great roommate and started to make friends with the people in my hall. Things were looking up. Well, my mom, who has been a special-education teacher for 10 years, decided to get her PhD at my school. We were having lunch one day and I mentioned how it was still a little hard to make friends and i still stayed in my room a lot. She said “Well it’s probably because you’re autistic”. This was the first time she has said anything like that. I didn’t think much of it and just a assumed it was similar to being “shy” or something.
A couple weeks later I began researching autism  and everything changed. I realized my mom was probably right. I started not going to class and just stayed in bed all day on my phone. I figured there was no point in doing anything because my brain was messed up. I had always had straight A’s and loved school hut I became so self conscious that I couldn’t face anyone. I started drinking every night with some of the people in my hall. I hated everything about myself, yet everything made sense.
I left my college and moved back home when I began to fail all of my classes. I started studying at a small local college and seeing a therapist. My therapist says he doesn’t think I have autism so everything is still confusing. I go back and forth thinking I do, and I keep wondering if I should try to get diagnosed. I’m not sure what it would change, but it makes me sad that my mom has always thought I had autism but never tried to get me help when I was younger or even told me about it. I also just feel stupid for not picking up on it earlier. I’m 22 now and still trying to figure things out in my head.

autism,harwinm,2019/03/20,"For adults with autism Hi all,

 I want to reach out directly to adults with autism. I am surprised by the lack of specialized work training opportunities particularly in regards to coding and computer interests made available directed towards adults with autism. I am playing around in my head with the idea/possibility of starting something like that up. But I feel too many things get started by people outside of a community without those in the community being involved/directing towards what they want. 

I am in the ""brainstorming"" stage of this, but I am curious, what would be the ideal situation in terms of learning and programs that you would want? I am into technology (although I am an instructional designer at a college)- so I am not a coder or anything like that. But I just love tech, so if I were to do this, it would probably be tech oriented (coding, gaming, etc.)

What would be your ideal scenario? More details the better? Here are some topics I would love to hear thoughts on:

\- What you would like to learn? - esp if something that could help point you in job direction

\- What you would like the physical learning space to be like?

\- Would you like additional services like social skills type training to be there?

\- If so, how would you like that to be run? 

\- Would you do it if you had to come in person or only if it is virtual?

\- What other services would be helpful and why? - Career services for example? Housing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else you would like to tell me/discuss/etc.,

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, enough questions, I appreciate your thoughts and time if you get a chance to answer this.

&amp;#x200B;

Parents and others feel free to chime in, but I specifically want to hear directly from those of you with autism. And I am planning on gearing this to high functioning adults, as I feel so many opportunities end in childhood, and that is a problem.

autism,Lucidless,2019/03/20,"Did getting a diagnosis make you feel better or worse? Hello

To preface – I’m a 25 yo female and mental health has been quite a special interest of mine for many years. I’ve acquired quite a lot of knowledge on various disorders. When I was 15 I started thinking that I may have Asperger’s Syndrome but dismissed it (since I knew a lot of symptoms of many disorders some had to eventually fit me; I hear it happens a lot with medical students). But for the past 5 years my interest has been rekindled and after years of research, conversations with my family and observing my behavior, I came to the conclusion that it most probably is AS (or autism according to DSM-V). The topic became more pressing because I’ve started having more problems in the social area (among many others) and generally “adulting” is quite hard – I guess I’ve reached my limits in my ability to mask and pass.

The thing is – I don’t have an official diagnosis. And because of that I feel like an imposter. Like I don’t have the right to tire easily when being social or to cut myself some slack when I just can’t function on the same level my peers do day after day. Until a specialist says I have AS I don’t have it, and I have to live like others even though it keeps getting more and more impossible.

I want to ask you – mostly people who were diagnosed later in life – did getting a diagnosis make a difference for you? Like you finally could accept who you are and take care of yourself properly because a specialist confirmed it?

I’m really torn about seeking a diagnosis because in my country there are no resources for adults and having a diagnosis of any kind is more of a stigma than help. But if you have positive experiences to share and if there is a lot of them then maybe it will help me make up my mind.

So… please share? Was seeking a diagnosis worth it? Did it help you with accepting who you are?",7.505619322278299,6.790589090410961,8.195803893294883,70.51878154289838,63.57534246575342,11.629416005767846,37.2927180966114,10.992663274268294,4.144972602739725,1498,66,273,36,19,504,183,365,0.042,0.753,0.205,0.9961,0,0,0,0,0,1,28.0,0,8,1,7,9,16,1,0,24,0,37,6,0,3,0,53,60,27,0,5,9,0,4,4,0,2,6,2,0,2,18,15,0,2,8,0,1,2,5,2,0,0,11,6,36,14,42,45,15,31,0,0,0,0,26,12,0,15,21,201,54,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06603999664209326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078730718631103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.236796111592744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08588833104435421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107110898836467,0.09901291560899833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07753662463400703,0.0,0.0,0.12525937299434814,0.0,0.0,0.0985673918247469,0.0,0.10146214898362467,0.22259923812431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414205208731283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09499489894692258,0.09154925304018056,0.0,0.09820624342449864,0.06937736433137115,0.0,0.10638226515965536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15221220302441615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698063704994176,0.0,0.08587647955911995,0.0,0.08699394450669411,0.0,0.0,0.10322630658852318,0.1094531213954974,0.0,0.19527787749070832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08631826969184668,0.0,0.10112797965892573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06859360365903375,0.1897775271357188,0.0,0.0857523328985316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3302471315782817,0.0,0.0,0.194470533858776,0.2953712425172582,0.09756280505102656,0.0,0.0,0.09783087366659324,0.097866805656596,0.0,0.09805618857601918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09270510350411856,0.06732574965037015,0.0,0.0,0.10660063144531412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047039640616259,0.09292378146746916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3098740740050339,0.0,0.0,0.06221291107067805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08293375349463182,0.0,0.07722795253210908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803326660828468,0.0,0.0,0.19798842737499286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13747380129562395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10093732571447912,0.07301669830381084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0645173925258395,0.06222592566492599,0.09541277875570968,0.0,0.0,0.11161681435363452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05727961302234499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989661835853042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876122711685179

It seems like i am seeing the world trough a dream or a movie, and I keep thinking if the life I am having right now is all there is, because it can feel so endlessly boring sometimes.

autism,Rollsworth,2019/03/20,"Anyone else get sudden anger This was a problem for me all my life, anger what switches on inside me which doesn't turn off, it doesn't take much to trigger it to come out from under the surface and I literally can't control what comes next.

It normally comes from when I am tasked with something difficult, it's extremely embarrassing to me because as a adult learning these types of behaviour isn't normal, coming to terms with ""meltdowns"" sounds really childish, and if someone told me i was having a melt down i would loose it, but I am aware of it.

My last anger episode as my mother calls it had me feeling so guiltily I went to the GP for a referral last year, I thought this ended in my teenager years, but they keep coming, and I am working again the traits from school are rearing their ugly heads and it's massively affecting my ability to work.

autism,Ace_Spoder,2019/03/20,"Resources for educating boyfriend on my ASD? Responses from other folx with ASD, or folx in a romantic relationship with someone with ASD preferred.

I'm looking for some good resources (websites, articles, studies, books) i could recommend to my boyfriend to help him learn about my ASD. I already suggested ASAN. He is very research based but i think it would be good for him to read some personal anecdotes as well.

I am just having issues right now with some of the stuff he is finding on the web without direction. It's a big place full of a lot of good information and also a lot of bad information. Namely that autism can ""go away"".

He knows all the basics like, what a meltdown is for me, what sensory overload means, things i have trouble with etc. I just think a combination of some more scientific information on autism and some personal articles would help him understand how I'm impacted and that it's not going away. Perhaps also some articles about dating someone on the spectrum if those exist. 

I was thinking of getting the Amazon book ""Knowing why: adult diagnosed people on life and autism"" to read and for him to read. If anyone has read that and thought it was good let me know.

Thanks!

autism,jordy90d,2019/03/21,"When you get diagnosed with autism Recently got diagnosed with autism at 28 years old.

Secretly I knew it when I was 12 but it was never a big problem.


After my 20s pretty much depression became a normal thing, changing jobs every year until last year when I had my biggest mental breakdown and body completely shutdown of stress.

It has been almost a year this happened and still recovering. The psychologist send papers to a specialized center which would help me to do something I like but I highly doubt it would happen and feel like I’m going to be placed in one of these boxes if u know what I mean.


My problem is that I know and can do a lot, I’m originally a chief electrical engineer, next to that I do a lot in the music business like making, recording, mixing and mastering but also have an advising role for some artists. Next to that I’m a workaholic and super sportive.

Since electrical engineering is not an option anymore because this creates the depression, I’m forced to do something else, music is just a side thing but what I like the most is editing and fixing. It has this psychological aspect of finding issues and solve them, sometimes create the illusion in order to have enough space in the mix.


To be honest I find it really hard to talk open about this, yet I felt the need to put at least a little background story about what I do and how it kinda got messed up. 

I’m wondering how other people try to control their ticks and did you find a way to ignore some of it by doing something or did you had to shut down completely from it? Like social media is not as it used to be and for that reason I only use the chat and stay

autism,JTaiyndieanv,2019/03/21,"Off day Hi, just a little context, I'm a 17 year old with high functioning autism and was diagnosed about a year ago.

I just went through a really shitty day. No matter what I said, it seemed like people took it the wrong way. I was told multiple times by multiple peers at different times that what I just said was so rude or really offensive.

I really didnt mean for anything to come off like that and my peers seemed genuinely angry or upset.

autism,jiminomegaslick,2019/03/21,"Can autism include *too much* awareness? I’ve always perceived autism in a social environment as something that will delay that person with autism; whether by social cues, lack of awareness, etc. Is there any possible way that my perceived notion could do a 180? Could autism cause *too much* awareness? The hyper fixation of a certain conversation, the right social cues, the “publicly acceptable” things to do, etc. And that still places a negative hold on things; as you’re worrying too much?

I’ve always been curious (for lack of better word) about whether I’m autistic due to the fact that I’ve never been tested and all the signs resemble my behavior; except the social ones. Is it just ADHD or OCD?

autism,newyorkchedda818391,2019/03/21,"Understanding my boyfriends autism Hello. I've never posted on reddit before... but I like to lurk and figured just hop in today. 

So I've been with my partner for close to a year now and early on in the relationship he let me know that he has autism very casually. At the time I didn't really think anything of it and life continued on. We rarely talk about his autism though he sometimes jokes about it (he's big on comedy). now have lived together for a few months and I'm starting to wonder about his autism and if/how it affects our relationship on a daily basis. 

For example, he often has a very particular way of doing certain tasks and if I do them in a different manner its wrong. He gets frustrated with me in these situations, which is understandable, and will give me a critique and tell me what i could do differently. Often times the delivery of his critiques are very harsh, even hurtful.  The other day after a string of critiques I tried to explain to him how he is coming off as very aggressive and how it made me feel bad though I'm trying to grow and change.  He simply didn't get how his critiques were aggressive, and explained that he just wanted to help me grow as a person. 

I don't think he is a malicious person, I think he just has a different way of communicating and I'd like to understand him better. I'm wondering if anyone has any resources on where I can start?

autism,boomerchief,2019/03/21,"Potty training struggles Hello everyone! First time poster in this forum. I have a 4 year old son who has recently been diagnosed as autistic.  We are working hard to help him continue to improve his social and learning skills and we have been doing pretty good....except with potty training.

autism,exo-geni,2019/03/22,"Relationships I (26F) am getting better at masking, I've worked really hard on it for years. However, when it comes to relationships I have no idea how to cope. I don't understand why people hold hands or cuddle, and I find a lot of guys like that. I just don't know how to act. I've been in a few very brief relationships, but they never last long because the other person doesn't understand why I act the way they do even when I try to explain it. As soon as I realize that they don't understand, I bail and end the relationship. I even had one boyfriend who literally said, ""it's okay, we can fix that!"" when I told him I don't act like other people (at that point I didn't know I had autism).

I just don't know what to do to. Could use some advice.

autism,IrisSaskia,2019/03/22,"So my best friend just said something that made me remember that there are plenty of people who view autism as a good thing Some info beforehand: I have PDD-NOS and most of the time I explain this to people as ""a form of autism"".

We were talking about some guy he knows and he told me: ""he has autism too btw"". 
So I told him I feel like the term autism is a bit loaded, because sometimes people immediately think about the children that act really weird and cannot talk.

After I said that he looked a bit confused at me and said: ""if I think about people with autism I just think about sweet, social and kind people"" and that just made me really happy 😊

autism,awholepineapple,2019/03/22,"Therapy and Autism I’m 17, in Uni, and I was diagnosed with Autism last year. I’ve been attending therapy on and off since I was in grade 11 (2016), mostly due to self harming issues. I don’t think it’s really helping though. 


I’m not very good at vocalising my emotions in therapy, and I haven’t really found that any of the suggested alternative coping mechanisms have helped. I also lie to my therapist about when I’ve self harmed because I don’t want to let her down. 


Has anyone else struggled with this, and if so, what did you do? I don’t think I can live this anxious and sad all the time, I feel like I’m losing control of my mind.",3.169007633587788,4.47257311450382,4.831977099236641,83.75224045801528,73.58015267175573,8.90412213740458,26.07709923664122,9.3871,2.125014656488549,502,17,106,12,10,170,86,131,0.154,0.797,0.049,-0.9243,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,0,2,5,7,0,1,2,0,13,1,0,1,1,19,21,11,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,5,8,0,1,4,0,0,1,5,5,0,0,5,1,14,2,15,15,2,13,0,2,0,0,7,7,0,2,6,63,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12004347432299532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020804250174012,0.0,0.0,0.16958236618347325,0.0,0.10496089323217063,0.15380615367515166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150609078941152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16836191669942627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523592029366274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253982299109806,0.16885433563691804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07590048135878752,0.10723911565161123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645886369642016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259057350588406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20123207898571915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15667657312133534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12236025730883104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534983633198869,0.0,0.07333650671484769,0.0,0.1325505002060569,0.0,0.0,0.1679354789412421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15156901748002882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19232951927852496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31319640066325044,0.0,0.0,0.12417312406843944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15692829847650389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5149940107600626,0.1742900950459543,0.0,0.19236975354199587,0.14748300276663054,0.0,0.0875307576163294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12385705018688828,0.08853918139702542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09666637064986977

autism,Kibure,2019/03/22,"Need some suggestions I have an autistic/ODD child who is hitting and kicking a lot lately.  We have a deal going where he gets to use his tablet after school if he has behaved that day.  Unfortunately in instances like yesterday we read the report from the teacher and explain to him that he cannot have the tablet because he was hitting and it triggers a full meltdown.  Hitting, kicking, screaming, and throwing things.  I can handle this and usually get him sequestered to his bed (a top bunk so he has no entertainment or interactions) and he will calm down and then can rejoin us.  But he has targeted his younger brother lately and I don't want him hurting his younger brother.   Anyone have a creative solution for how I can possibly punish my son that may avoid or contain a meltdown, make him feel chastised, and protect his little brother?

autism,Sleepmoover,2019/03/22,"Is there 'a type of' autism that makes people more interested in social situations/relations? First time posting here, but I've been wondering over something lately.

People with autism have been described to me as often perceiving social situations in a different way which can make it hard for people with autism and someone who doesn't have autism to communicate. 

Something I've also heard is how someone with autism might not pick up on 'hidden signals' or 'hints' in a conversation

But considering people have also described autistic people as often very interested and very focused on specific things, often making them very good at them.

Wouldn't it be possible for someone with autism to be very good/interested in social situations, relationships, communications and etc?",11.007175824175825,11.507763915384619,10.079010989010992,55.878846153846176,56.0,12.65934065934066,40.10989010989012,12.031772070788634,5.390835164835166,639,28,86,17,7,203,78,130,0.012,0.879,0.109,0.931,1,0,2,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,2,1,8,3,0,0,3,0,13,0,0,5,0,23,18,11,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,6,7,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,3,2,3,3,21,11,2,14,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,6,3,64,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19436180153872407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269643657303796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13552887574595998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1033663397458586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038533591942688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10885962003878777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137081828806093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24335013827287205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12891537441757026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4212394073705831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13699751583673775,0.11638424622154095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13046888286427738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.273191080493937,0.0,0.3716283661754245,0.30889495707701264,0.18710676263949744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08073365193500076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086031055125945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40107268709706734,0.0,0.09645830996817883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178515573009314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,DBFY123,2019/03/23,"Workplace upheaval... My life has been tumultuous, to say the least. I have been fortunate, as I’ve had a supportive family system. A little back story: during elementary school and high school, I primarily relied on sports to occupy my time (aside from school, of course). During elementary, I would climb trees, avoid socializing, and “forget” peer's birthdays. During HS, sports and school kept me busy. I did not pursue friendships or date women.

Post-secondary school: first 1/4 athletics/ academics , last 3/4 strictly academics. Just like HS did not pursue friendships or date women. Graduated from college, but it’s been tumultuous since: underemployed, given a chance (then ultimately terminated), keep trying but never exceed $12.00 per hour. Never able to find my niche and/ or be able to support myself. (Dependency on mom).

Fast forward (repeating lack of friends/ inability to socialize/ dependency on family, underemployment, etc.) 20 yrs.

Btw: never have seen a “formal” diagnosis, except when I see notes from my psychiatrist that say “autism”. I later ask him what my dx is, he confirms “autism”.

Procure a job for a couple years, making a somewhat decent wage. Everything is going fine, when employee C tells me that ""someone was looking for me"" after work on the previous Friday (2/ 15). (Haven’t seen nor heard from person/ people looking for me). Worked 2/ 18, 19, 20. Skipped out of work on Thursday + Friday. 2/ 18: Noted two fellow coworkers have (individually) meetings with my boss. After said meetings, each coworker has a look of disgust/ shock when I’m in their presence. 2/ 22: Emergency meeting with psych Dr. I become suicidal and spend the rest of day (til 4 PM) on suicide watch at neighboring hospital. I know AT LEAST three people have compromising information about me starting on 2/ 18/ 2019. Two weeks pass. I still work there, but am EXTREMELY paranoid. I continue to work and I notice employee A + B + boss all basically ignore me. Only recently have I noticed them “soften” up (but still have an air of cautiousness about them.)
I’m really concerned I’ll get arrested and go to jail. I am a very placid person and have ZERO street smarts. Additionally, I’m socially clueless! I would definitely get killed and/ or injured while imprisoned. 
Saw my psych Dr., and he believes the Adderall is contributing to paranoia. He has prescribed Seroquil.

Redditors: how should I approach this situation? Should I try to clarify with my boss?

I get out of breath sometimes and it's really uncomfortable. It almost looks like I'm about to puke and I feel so uncomfortable because I feel like I stim like this out of need, not because it is enjoyable.

I wish I knew how to stop but when I get the urge to stim with my chest, I can't stop. Sometimes it lasts hours.

autism,jacuzzipuma,2019/03/23,My autistic daughter has to be the 1st person to get to the door or she gets very upset. My daughter is about to be 5yrs old and she is autistic. On Halloween she became obsessed with being the first person to the door to knock. It was cute but caused a few problems with my 6 year old because she was excited to trick or treat too. So this behavior has continued to grow. Now my autistic daughter wants to be the 1st out of the car and gets very upset and anxious at the thought of not being 1st to the door in any circumstance. Can anyone offer advice about something to ease this transition. Thank you for your input. ,4.303597449908929,5.680518303278693,4.688469945355191,85.59250455373406,70.88524590163935,7.0615664845173045,28.30965391621129,7.3871296695380915,1.5786200364298724,491,18,94,5,9,155,73,122,0.107,0.784,0.109,0.3112,1,0,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,2,0,1,5,9,1,3,9,0,12,0,0,1,0,14,18,7,0,2,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,6,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,5,0,1,3,0,10,4,22,10,1,12,0,0,0,0,12,4,0,2,6,68,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20969732544493835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14593027124819788,0.0,0.0,0.2424284645351636,0.0,0.150048078436319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13081360748140236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22044562869478376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18253228658292328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3363472017574402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45035749956694576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3747478198112152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20533605881973616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16520380475736107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1975679595897885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1703624894454432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541226033628522,0.12657222729194956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13819054620030874
autism,DecafCornet,2019/03/23,"Question regarding Autism I’ve been speaking with this nice guy on a dating thing, and he informed me that he was a motivational speaker for mental illnesses. I deal with depression so I wanted to watch a video of one of his speeches; I discovered that he has autism which seemed to have caused a lot of emotional struggles in his life. I regretfully do not know much about autism. I feel he may not have wanted me to know that since he didn’t include that part; he may feel I would judge him like others do. I know that those with autism have different struggles and fall on different areas of a spectrum; i want to ask him about it so that I do not say something that could potentially upset him, but I also feel kinda like I invaded his privacy by watching the videos. Should I ask if there’s anything that particularly upsets him? I’m a nice person, but I do make sarcastic jokes and my humor might suck. I may be overthinking but I’m not knowledgeable regarding this disability nor do I know how severe his is.

If you would like to share some information about autism. That would be nice. It’s something I should know more about regardless.

autism,BlaBlaFaithFaithYhYh,2019/03/23,"Looking for gloves to help with sensory issues My sensory issues with using my hands and touching things is getting a lot worse. I have to wash my hands pretty much every time I touch anything. I am finding it very difficult to function when using my hands is really hurting me. Please can someone give me some suggestions on what kind of gloves to look for? I’ve seen others wear gloves for this in the past but regrettably never asked them. I’m worried that latex gloves will be too loose and in the way and too obvious, potentially limiting my fine motor skills too much. I need to be able to do pretty much all tasks with them on and wear them out to uni etc. Thanks in advance!",5.314242424242423,6.413994666666667,5.5057575757575785,81.71196969696972,68.24242424242425,8.593939393939394,28.303030303030305,8.841846274778883,2.1384030303030306,544,18,102,9,9,172,87,132,0.108,0.779,0.113,0.1731,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,3,3,4,5,0,0,3,0,9,6,5,2,3,19,20,6,0,1,1,0,5,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,8,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,8,14,3,20,16,7,12,0,1,3,0,7,6,0,2,4,69,20,0,0.16116358302247175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13262389680027284,0.0,0.15066619464149086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17973999673925478,0.0,0.0,0.13578726962477172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14730059515805566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842013203476557,0.15460279421996065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080245525174342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725289488900631,0.0,0.0,0.3364258181241256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678270711975672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27067363930658395,0.0,0.0,0.13701551502143744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3554213317231432,0.11950075471481728,0.12429929064667053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384887603448066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769092176430058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279226065756294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10324551811359224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365533808993457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14837777423683732,0.0,0.0,0.1070699233331295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09397578130360623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2783871809191473,0.0,0.13297683440936378,0.0,0.12792415065592624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636694416258064,0.16423945968999096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,gkcky,2019/03/23,"do i have autism? hi guys, i might have misperceptions about autism so i apologize if i say anything incorrect. 

i'm a 19 year old female and i think there is something wrong with me. i'm socially inept, i don't have any friends. i've never tried to make friends. i am always uncomfortable around people. even the idea of having a chitchat with someone is so exhausting to me. i am emotionally constipated. when people tell me about their life or their feelings i can't understand them. i can't feel the way they feel. i can't make eye contact. my sleep schedule is a mess. droping off to sleep is so hard for me. and when i wake up i don't want to get out of my bed. most of time i don't get out of my bed and i don't go to school. i procrastinate a lot. i often forgot about homework assignments but i remember useless details from a memory which happened like 4 years ago. i have deep knowledge about things that i like but my family considers them as useless information. i have speaking issues sometimes. my self esteem is extremely low and i don't know what to do. what do you think about all of these? do i have autism or am i just depressed? should i see a doctor?

autism,moeys92,2019/03/23,"I know nothing about autism and honestly do not know where to begin. My son of 3 years shows signs of autism. He says small words, plays well with others (unless they've stolen his toys), makes eye contact and generally is a alright kid.
I do believe he shows others signs such as constantly walking on his tip toes and his lack of speech. Also he had a obsession with spinning wheels on cars but now only does that about once a week instead of 20 times a day.
I honestoy do not mean to offend anyone by this post. I just want to know what and how autism is and works. I was extremely shallow and ignorant with this subject because I knew nothing about it and how broad it really is.
I just want to know what it's about, how it affects people in different ways and pretty much anything else that might need knowing.
Once again, please I do not mean or want to hurt anyone's feelings. We are all unique in our own ways and I love that. I guess I'm just a scared father who's trying to do the best for my son in every single way. Thank you all in advance. Your help/comments are truly much appreciated.

autism,_TheMartiniPolice_,2019/03/23,"Autism awareness website/blog title Hey Folks! I’m currently at my last year of school, and one of the requirements for earning the diploma on my curriculum is to undertake a large project which is majorly non-academic and social. As an aspiring neurologist, I have a great interest and passion for the spectrum of autism, and I believe that the region where I live in does not have as much information and resources on the spectrum as it should, and that is why I decided to create a little website to foster interest and awareness on autism. I wanted to ask you if you would have any ideas of an interesting and strong website name for it",10.893193277310926,8.451857478991599,10.25166386554622,63.95363025210085,58.24369747899159,13.889747899159666,45.648739495798324,12.340626583579946,5.661334789915968,516,26,87,13,5,167,73,119,0.0,0.825,0.175,0.9661,1,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,2,0,3,1,6,0,0,10,0,8,1,0,0,0,18,11,12,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,8,0,1,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,9,6,19,9,2,10,0,0,0,1,7,7,0,1,3,64,14,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18539422930359453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25486740917891915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3071548191877545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385758210290289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3005698313641762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30776024275323216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22222561864621213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732416951718005,0.2407327146739332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20041061455700312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847376366073408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2759108770494642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27790667603412256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16080118490371245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2460014999527966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19366485327379707,0.0,0.0,0.17556144856521946
autism,redditamrur,2019/03/23,"No, social reaction is not getting better (sorry for the rant) I am going to be extra annoying today, I am not trolling though, just have to get something off my chest. 

Someone wrote here that social reaction / acceptance is getting better. I have no idea what they're talking about. When my 9-year-old (usually extremely HF, but we all have our limits) lays down on a restaurant floor like a 3-year-old, mostly I see people staring at the attraction while pretending not to notice.  When I myself have extreme difficulties to fit in in my old working space, no-one is ""accepting"", and in fact my old supervisor used to use any weak spot I have to humiliate me. What I see is that when someone makes a huge social gaffe online, people make him into a meme and mock him forever (e.g. Star Wars Boy).  No, they're not more accepting. 

They are more accepting when you're making a huge effort of normalising. Obviously. And when some people - some of whom I am not really sure ARE autistic - claim they are, but hey look how successful, beautiful and social we are (like someone just said here a few days ago). 

Sorry, have to get back to my cave, I have spat a little too much poison even for my taste.

autism,wojcech,2019/03/23,"How to frame discussion around neurodevelopment and bioethics respectfully? So, I recently came over this study https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l962 and it made me think about what a difficult thing ableism is, and how it will only get harder to deal with as we learn more about how we humans work. I figured my perspective on this will be really incomplete so I wanted to get y'alls perspective.
 
Basically, I'm down with not treating autism as a disease, the idea of neurodiversity and getting away from a normative view of human development. *However* (dum dum daaaam) there's devils in the details. Using the study I linked as an example, ahould we take steps to minimise pesticide usage around inhabited areas to minimise the impact on prenatal development? But that feels a bit like framing the outcomes (something like autism being amongst them) as something to avoid, i.e. the disease framing.
 
 Another aspect that I struggle with: let's assume we figure out the human neurodevelopmental complex 100% and can control the neurotype our children end up with. Would it be ethical to ""clip"" the neurotype to one standard deviation around the mean (trying really hard to no use ableist framing here)? Would it be ethical *not to*? I'm sure the question ""if you could choose whether your child is neurotypical or not, what would you do"" is asked in bad faith, but what are the actual answers if asked in good faith?

I hope this is okay to post like this, I checked the rules and it *feels* it should be okay? 

Cheers,

autism,RainyNeonNight,2019/03/23,"What to do when 6yo daughters keep repeating the same question 5~10 times? Hey all,

So I love playing video games with my autistic, partially verbal daughter, but I do notice that when we are on a tough level, she keep repeating the same question repeatedly.

Like ""Did you get the moon?..... did you get the moon?....""

And no I'm still trying to get that moon.

I totally don't want to correct her, but at the same time am afraid she might repeat that behavior at school and get made fun of.

But then I want her to feel safe at home, where she can be herself.

So what would be the best thing to do?

I remember back in school we answered a question on what would your wish be if you could become anything for an hour?  
One of my (very philosophical and great) friends answered, He would *want to be* ***neurotypical*** *to see what it's like.*

And, I might as well come and agree with it. What is it like to be normal? What is it to be something a regular average person is?

Now, I want to ask you, if you had the chance to be neurotypical ***for the day,*** would you do this? I ask this question because I generally want to hear what you guys think of being ""normal"".

autism,jordanwhite916,2019/03/24,"I'm a 27 year old autism success story I live in the Atlanta, GA area where I work as a software engineer at a large retail company based in the area. I also successfully practice independent living in a unit that just happens to be connected to where my parents live. I live downstairs, they live upstairs. At 27 years old, I'm making more than my brother and sister. They will be finishing college soon, but I finished before they did, and I'm the middle child. As part of my job, I'm fascinated with computers, digital storage, video resolution, graphics specs, core counts, and most importantly, the software frameworks and code that this software runs on. I'm especially concerned over Apple's ARM processors in Macs by 2020. I develop on a Mac, but when I upgrade, I don't want to be faced with failing software and years of archived code lost. I coped with the early years of my career because I was determined to have a career and achieve the American dream, just like Mom and Dad when they were my age. 

Soon on this subreddit, I will upload the video containing my latest speech. The speech doesn't happen until Tuesday night, yet you'll learn more about how you as parents of autistic children can motivate your children to be successful, understanding that they have superpowers, like Mom and Dad motivated me.

The superpower angle plays up really well with me. I just happen to be a huge fan of comic book superheroes. Superman, Batman, Spiderman, the Justice League, the Avengers. I relate to them because they have powers, they don't know how to use them at first, but when they do, they save trillions of lives, as I believe will happen in Avengers: Endgame (can't wait!!)",8.144448886350661,8.145914394822007,7.843160098991056,71.20529982866938,62.009708737864074,10.89518370454978,38.24119550732915,10.46071229359064,4.107083228631256,1344,62,228,28,17,428,172,309,0.027000000000000003,0.795,0.17800000000000002,0.9939,6,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,0,3,11,11,16,10,0,0,18,0,21,2,2,7,0,33,37,22,0,1,6,8,0,2,0,4,0,2,0,3,5,12,0,2,5,6,1,1,4,2,1,2,4,2,36,8,39,24,4,41,0,2,0,0,25,19,0,1,23,150,41,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128790198800296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13917289705916047,0.0,0.09713557085684862,0.12861104324576167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09709825919367736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4037795509088326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132789767354076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06273535852617497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115385217711098,0.0,0.6047937452416796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12461119637800999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07619783790007344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2673886102326864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10712461011219328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23956818840869534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2535062092221354,0.12361628932504072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312916593057342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883702431527135,0.0,0.09859131281603174,0.0,0.0,0.06733024147337087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263701913873062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0831045515890696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29404247816679124
autism,kalsarikanni,2019/03/24,"family - advice appreciated Hey,

I’m a new mom and I have several nieces and nephews. I love them all so so dearly. One of my nephews is on the autism spectrum - he does speak, on occasion, and I engage with him so happily when he does decide to say something to me. I always greet him from a distance and am very respectful of his personal space, am quiet, try to make (but don’t force) eye contact, and never surprise him. I really love him to bits and want to build our relationship. 

Im having a hiccup in that he is not gentle with my baby (under 1 year old - squishing her cheeks, forcefully taking her toys from her hands, pulling her hair) and I think that his mother is too lenient with him. I am not versed in what appropriate discipline / conversation would be, so am just inclined to keep my child away. I ask him to keep hands away from the baby’s face but she allows it. It is really really important to me that the cousins become friends and the situation has me feeling like a bad mom/aunt. I wish I wasn’t so protective and scared of his size/behaviour. I don’t blame him or think he is trying to be malicious, and I do think he could be confusing the baby’s teethers with his own chewy sensory necklaces. 


If anyone has any advice for me or some insight it would be greatly appreciated. Please forgive me if this is not the correct forum for this ask.

autism,Myynek,2019/03/24,"Do you hide the fact that you're autistic from your friends or have you told them?  I just think it would be a strange and random thing to tell them. I haven't really been hiding it much but you wouldn't guess I have it. 

It is seen as a bad thing to have and would only make people see me differently if they knew. One of my friends has found out and doesn't see me differently but I'm pretty sure many other people still think it is what they see on the internet (something to make fun of or something that makes you stupid).

autism,autistsproudpapa,2019/03/24,"At the end of my rope with autistic son's obsession. Need advice. My 4yo son who is otherwise mildly impacted has an obsession with cars. I don't mean he likes cars or enjoys them or is fascinated with them. I mean they are the center of his Universe to an extent that it is tearing me and my wife to shreds. Any time he meets someone, the first thing he will ask them is ""which car do you have? can I sit in it?"". By a conservative estimate, my wife and I probably spend anywhere from 4 to 6 hours a day sitting in one of our two cars with him. He just likes to get in the driver's seat, pretend he's turning it on, then pretend he's turning it off, then get out saying ""I need to get something from the back"" and then go open the rear door or the trunk and pretend to take something out before coming back in to the driver's seat. And like I said, as a conservative estimate, this happens on average 4-6 hours a day. Considering that he sleeps about 10-12 hours at night, this equates to 33%-50% of his waking time. It might seem comical to someone who hasn't lived through it but sitting with him in the car is so irritating to me and my wife that once one of us ""taps out"" and the other one goes in, the newly relieved parent can normally be found screaming and sobbing into a pillow. I have seriously considered suicide. I have seriously considered abandoning my wife and son. I have seriously considered fleeing the country. He is in ABA therapy and we have asked his therapists and they have no reasonable options for us other than ""it'll hopefully get better with time"". At times I blame him for being this way, I blame myself for having had a child in the first place. I just need some help, I need someone who is on the spectrum to tell me what is going on inside his brain? Why is he so obsessed with cars? If my wife or I force him out of the car and make him stay out he cries and wails for hours until he has breathing issues. We have had the police called on us by our neighbors because they have thought we are abusing him. My wife has constantly refused but I have even talked to a family lawyer about giving him up to the state, but apparently a judge needs to decide that based on our state laws.

Please, someone on ASD help me understand my son.",6.148026607538803,5.726498055432376,6.620766297117517,79.72617383592019,66.22838137472284,9.876753880266076,32.23068736141907,9.3871,2.6515097294900216,1777,64,361,30,25,580,208,451,0.129,0.8079999999999999,0.063,-0.9808,2,0,2,0,0,1,50.0,9,1,6,3,9,16,0,3,27,0,36,4,4,2,0,65,64,28,1,8,10,11,0,3,1,3,0,3,3,1,22,31,0,4,8,4,1,11,3,9,0,6,5,3,56,7,67,54,2,68,0,2,0,0,66,29,1,10,24,246,78,1,0.0,0.10072491646003544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307241073375601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057810844300929726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15894885363768085,0.0,0.0,0.13073743890604386,0.0,0.051822319179329834,0.0,0.07233866166442196,0.0,0.0,0.0751859052958681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490112814059252,0.08680641022424332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0732300180572733,0.0,0.09186740403395842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09338131719800362,0.10965097634170347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07529509838824544,0.0,0.0,0.05614939998343755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08014142765717347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14462174995331376,0.0,0.09321089781530324,0.0,0.0,0.17766033549709584,0.08155093107952494,0.09662817149133322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517553060776318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139630481026378,0.0,0.0,0.08443576058159975,0.33487744511414896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873008681906194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12459720961810555,0.0,0.0750668536902786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056745943497229674,0.0,0.0,0.18520524057147694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09018393748871542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151753453380035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07977768451332161,0.08329337758650908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905346439314899,0.1728183037823656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09439538851208217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08881909139273604,0.09331727468529004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09165694839237254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08740614564621929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08086555659151258,0.06760468453245874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07739142288695419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08507305488520929,0.0,0.288120416208128,0.1308922590639937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09061111891108088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09298895861505647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06391818884980142,0.06832915250992118,0.07430393830074401,0.0,0.09721824259935627,0.09870509009125228,0.05647796977076061,0.0,0.0,0.06748976252705298,0.19828393148784185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18493654978033727,0.08304403961224792,0.0885001366576413,0.3067756810458182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06747829912249602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07670980086590301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,weedyweenie,2019/03/24,"I don't think I'm doing enough.. My son is a loveable 6 year old on the spectrum,  and nonverbal. His interests are staring out doors or being outdoors,  playing at the play ground,  sitting in people's laps,  being carried,  tickling,  watching Mickey mouse and being read to... 

But lately  I'm having issues interacting with him.  We are trying to get away from tickling and moving on to playing with toys(which he doesn't really do) but nothing is working.  I've tried playing with his toys and he just walked away. I've sat in his room waiting for him to even look in the direction of the toys but nothing..  All he likes to do is walk around his room and stem on the things he's shaking in his hands. 


I'm not the imaginative type so any advice would be appreciated..

autism,casushiroll,2019/03/24,"How can I talk to my cousin and tell her that I think her child has autism in a way that wouldn't upset her? My nephew is almost four years old and I am worried that we are not helping/ supporting him to the best of our abilities. My cousin constantly says he is fine and that there is nothing wrong with her son but I truly believe he may have autism. Why I think my nephew may have autism is because he doesn't talk, he doesn't make eye contact, he doesn't respond to his name, and he can't sit still. 
I love my nephew very much and I want to support him the best I can but I feel like because his mother refuses to acknowledge something may be wrong she is holding him back and not helping him grow. 
For instance, I picked up a book on sign language and I tried to teach him to sign so I could understand what he wanted and he could express himself and my cousin took it so negatively that she wouldnt let me teach him sign language.  But guess what he now is able to let us know when he is thirsty or hungry! 
I feel so frustrated because I don't know what to do or how to talk about this with her because she gets so defensive and shuts everyone out. I feel like this really needs to be addressed now and not later because he will go to preschool soon.

I would greatly appreciate any advice.

autism,ThisGuyLikesPoetry,2019/03/24,"How to get diagnosed? I'm a 16.5-year-old boy with non-diagnosed autism. I want to get diagnosed for many reasons. 1. For school. I was recently placed in Special Education and I think an autism diagnosis would help the school understand my issues a lot better. 2. So people don't think I'm faking it. 3. To find out more about my autism and what a professional's input on it is.

I have access to regular therapists but I know it's not good to get an autism diagnosis from them as they're not very competent in ASD and can't give an in depth evaluation on it. I have medicaid, does anyone know how a minor would get diagnosed when using medicaid? Would the school be able to get a diagnosis since it's effecting my education? I don't know how to go about it. Thanks in advance for any replies. It's a very frustrating situation to know you're autistic but not being able to communicate it due to lack of diagnosis. No one takes you seriously without a diagnosis.",2.934126984126987,5.242977359788362,5.112407407407408,77.11083333333335,76.98941798941799,9.491005291005294,27.43121693121693,9.861636050157227,3.0581661375661384,767,32,149,25,18,266,104,189,0.102,0.83,0.068,-0.8478,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,1,4,7,7,1,0,12,0,12,3,0,6,0,31,32,11,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,10,0,0,2,8,3,0,1,1,0,12,4,27,26,3,14,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,1,3,90,21,4,0.23532585257862515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800148247103993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08227265386079087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10406329652661407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4777015735940461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10296761971224536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10754178298479204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3073701131398767,0.1128730004587236,0.06687055255341674,0.09869008009174902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07886697926368735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12280952525807637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2586578685489848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10003281226511128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929173933082406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12346744810600048,0.0,0.07973144399410505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08157265794494205,0.0,0.12293271469505962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12097708495811382,0.1161779447495013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35724348938584843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09733198852164998,0.13225805903254445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08846787723771071,0.0,0.0,0.10832821401449563,0.0,0.13661572629114338,0.0,0.1507873042909219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12249125587314187,0.0,0.1016229899276062,0.0,0.19416847369437604,0.06940064246673719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11342286213158108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507531007649485,0.0,0.0,0.07577106679974452
autism,doomofdoctors69,2019/03/24,"Does anybody else ever get really sad about when they were younger? I wish I had a better relationship with my parents.... but instead over the years I’ve come to resent them, and it fills me with regret that she couldn’t have been more loving, and I feel that my autism caused everyone so much trouble.
As a kid I was a huge crybaby in elementary, and I was such a tender child. Looking back on it, why was I so vulnerable? Nowadays, i spend my time late at night browsing the internet,,,, and I wonder what happened to the innocent child I once was. That part of me that I will never get back, lost forever.
Honestly I wish I could redo junior high too. Junior high was so terrible, but it was probably the most formative years of my life. Unfortunately, it was that time I ended up making some toxic relationship that lasted well over a year, and I regret letting it so. I isolated myself and junior high was hell.
I’m like only in high school, but still I feel so sad about losing so much time and I feel so heavily depressed.

If I had been diagnosed with my autism before 7th grade would life have been easier? Would I have turned out different, happy? I just wanna go back and live my childhood, untainted by the cruelty of the world that the internet exposed me to, that growing up exposed me to, that  I first saw that day I entered junior high and a small part of my childlike innocence died, as the rest would soon die too. I’m sorry if this is super poignant, but I’m really in a depressive funk right now.....",4.5615383373688445,5.771840433898305,5.6885714285714295,79.29870056497177,70.08474576271186,9.14447134786118,27.94592413236481,9.48565724429506,2.4655585149313954,1188,41,227,26,21,395,158,295,0.215,0.64,0.145,-0.9813,2,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,0,0,2,5,23,20,2,0,15,0,25,5,0,2,2,41,45,25,2,12,7,1,3,1,0,4,4,0,0,3,17,14,0,0,4,0,1,5,2,12,1,1,16,5,37,8,27,22,8,46,1,8,2,1,10,19,1,5,23,167,54,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21928873537498894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089013505667378,0.0,0.0,0.08407396396071623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976541051481837,0.0,0.08188686263418764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589868502333176,0.0,0.0,0.061306651804832024,0.0,0.16375225677236213,0.0964851831117319,0.19731716999212268,0.0993187893314736,0.0,0.0,0.08318875374656287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07941148904461341,0.0,0.08419606525187133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085988356695794,0.0,0.09083511261974804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14419749580635308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08085906358155412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09933117507233392,0.0,0.05402550767715974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840623628348083,0.10119448441802073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5021872293266804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07748761876203689,0.10723324767579076,0.0,0.0,0.09720658422209437,0.13428916575377647,0.0464421324263556,0.0,0.0839408387378648,0.0,0.07982752094153063,0.10634923998218716,0.10377060036478122,0.0,0.08579650324492494,0.0,0.06345413265596621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397619355613685,0.0,0.07331710803116345,0.0,0.0,0.08920855772432906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10123714492948532,0.0,0.07229837577752987,0.0,0.0,0.10555428521599164,0.2058841730274836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10249212196841156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12179736128639675,0.0,0.0,0.20412044618924635,0.0,0.08118180103923364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09620707541890122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10641330356427417,0.0,0.0,0.0759160491510361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16629296452869285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339935896273462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08547149377627784,0.0,0.08577800597139411,0.0,0.2186315270310375,0.0,0.10308988702206172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20258638598248205,0.0,0.0,0.18364901416776255

autism,siobhankei,2019/03/25,"Coaching ideas? I have a kindergartner in my class (I'm a para) who really likes to eat his lunch...throw it up...and eat it again. Much like how a deer ruminates. 

I want to help him learn that this behavior is bad so he doesn't end up with health problems when he's older. The trouble I run into is that he is still little and nonverbal. The most I know how to do is scold him and tell him it's ""yucky"" so he will hopefully understand. 

He is so smart and I know that he will eventually figure it out but when I do this he immediately bursts into tears and I feel so, so bad. He's my favorite little fella and he's already got problems with his teeth and I would hate to see him struggle with this forever. 

I was wondering if there was any other coaching or teaching skills I could use to stop this?",1.5100681818181805,3.531018381818185,3.235511363636366,90.23326704545458,80.33333333333333,6.791666666666668,21.82765151515152,7.8658589789855275,0.9176742424242424,623,19,137,11,16,207,95,165,0.173,0.74,0.08800000000000001,-0.9484,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,1,12,11,1,1,5,0,15,4,1,3,0,34,27,18,0,7,3,0,1,2,0,3,1,0,0,0,13,12,2,1,8,2,0,1,1,7,0,0,3,2,18,4,13,20,2,15,0,0,1,0,18,7,0,5,9,87,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1885059557063856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161645903121644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28525791105055825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363872000722744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34958641910750504,0.0,0.0,0.1512972931385466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637256672899472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13662169081251982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1686510294317976,0.0,0.18157544251979216,0.0,0.0,0.11449816166545332,0.0,0.0,0.16966445749521414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1928368679440246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877582400496429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16690967452385436,0.34241637072592634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255735791867605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32690652796143155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10943273310292773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13612275110375655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13641840278360678,0.1428145613044403,0.0,0.17857989421380865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1493056649779366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17783137820805234,0.0,0.14753507283136405,0.0,0.0,0.10075504418997676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18524880954635664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1213468101079664,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Pulsar2076,2019/03/25,"Language delays In the process of getting a diagnosis (35m)

When I was a child 4 years old or So,my mother was told I would never be able to talk in a way people who are not around me all the time would understand


With speech therapy I seem to have proven them wrong.

I stutter a bit and have trouble coming up with the proper word but otherwise speak...ok

I find I rehearse conversations in my head over and over again so I don't sound like an idiot when the conversation happens

Of course, things never go as planned

I find advertising my eyes helps me in conversations 

I always walk away feeling the people think I am stupider then I am because I can never use language that would show my intellegence.

Anyone else feel this way?

autism,blue_fox_87,2019/03/25,"Autism and friendships My 11 year old son was diagnosed with autism a few years back and the family as a whole has fantastic people around so he has a huge network of loving people around him. 

He is a very intelligent child so doesn't receive much help at school because of this but the school is aware he needs some different teaching techniques during the school day, for example he's slow when getting changed and can get irritated if he feels there's anger towards him therefore soft voice to remind him to change quickly. 

The biggest issue he has currently is being social. He is sometimes seen as arrogant because he knows he's smart and he will tell you. 
Or he will speak the truth and say 'no I don't like your new hair cut.'
We are currently teaching 'white lies' but it has proven difficult because he will tell you he's telling a white lie so you don't get upset. 

Typing this now has made me realise why I love Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory haha. 

Anyway, friendship is difficult for him. He has a very best friend at school. They are a great team. But they fall out over everything. 
The big thing now is a Fortnite match gone wrong. Something to do with him killing a guy so getting the gear but his mate wanted the gear and now he's unfriended him or something. 
He has only just got this game back in his life after we noticed a huge behavioural difference in him so he does play but on limited times and days.  
It's not just falling out over online gaming but also little issues at school. 
I don't think it's as bad as he says it is but it's so difficult to see it through his perspective sometimes. 

Has anyone got any tips for my son that will help his friendships grow please?",4.120910565338279,5.808862930722897,4.317710843373494,86.85013438368863,71.80120481927709,7.3968489341983314,27.22706209453197,8.012643519586192,1.6324852641334573,1351,48,265,19,26,420,180,332,0.138,0.696,0.165,0.867,3,0,2,0,0,0,19.0,2,4,2,3,20,19,3,1,19,1,29,5,1,2,1,38,46,29,1,3,13,2,3,1,2,4,2,4,0,2,11,15,0,1,3,4,0,5,6,9,0,0,6,11,25,10,31,35,5,42,0,0,4,2,58,19,0,4,19,157,36,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07621663555875187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06481174087230995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06664057494598016,0.0,0.0,0.16968612020842602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14656975028042787,0.07957701121788921,0.17429401504168207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001837309217716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20164344349585456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292971588619372,0.0,0.0,0.0967341699307883,0.0,0.1991501769424061,0.0,0.0,0.08340342819199183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08565540641443202,0.0,0.08984655915793584,0.0,0.04818986920431384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07363362532480779,0.0,0.1991750123486822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15245075282722614,0.1050758381077139,0.0,0.0943684957608298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277639797855014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19895061087707108,0.0,0.0,0.10544260711154116,0.0,0.05237800248783785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06731785420796946,0.04656197962413355,0.09552222854782286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17203581434366053,0.09018138800610373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07006130054597677,0.07066861955883585,0.0,0.0920476864004914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10850717012211954,0.10000822074876664,0.0,0.0,0.07248494683463141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214716118239625,0.0,0.0,0.10461800201931873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15158323143886382,0.0,0.4822767228072221,0.07594700284875677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09715305347672608,0.0,0.14674331916841407,0.18852128417497205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2499064485136301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633174551598414,0.06106860652328119,0.0,0.0,0.055574031750156384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15727581542794122,0.05621428869219796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08599936216478067,0.10640639013623196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042027809716489,0.0,0.1227486222663756
autism,fflando,2019/03/25,"Sleeping arrangement issues Hello all, this is my first time posting to this community. I am a soon to be stepdad of a child (9 y/o M) with autism. He is a great kid with an amazing mom and we all enjoy spending time together. He and I have a pretty good relationship, studying science, playing video games and outdoorsy kinda of things. He is on the higher functioning end of the spectrum, but is not without his issues, of course.

So, why I’m here: With the wedding around the corner, it’s almost fine for us all to move in together. I didn’t find out until after we signed all the paperwork for our house that he still sleeps in the same bed as his mother. I’ve been pretty cool about this, gently reminding his mom ever so often that this will need to change once I am fully moved in. (I stay at my house when she has the kids) Obviously, sharing a bed with a child that is not biologically mine is beyond inappropriate, let alone a child with autism.

So here’s the rub: his mom says he likes me a lot and enjoys me being there, but that her bed is his “safe space” and that he “doesn’t want anything to change.”   This has put me in a bad position because obviously, I am still learning the ins and outs of my soon to be step son’s autism, but also because we’ve already acquired our new home and at the end of May, my lease is up at my house.

What in the world am I supposed to do, guys?",6.024999999999999,5.16483334397163,6.7221418439716345,80.35300000000002,66.6241134751773,9.363971631205676,30.50212765957447,8.447377352677275,2.0343174468085112,1081,33,228,13,15,358,157,282,0.025,0.828,0.147,0.9854,0,1,0,0,0,0,34.0,5,0,0,2,17,12,0,0,21,1,25,2,2,0,7,42,28,17,0,2,6,5,1,1,0,2,0,1,4,6,13,17,0,1,2,3,1,4,5,1,0,1,2,3,28,11,40,20,6,38,0,0,0,0,35,18,0,5,15,160,41,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118179722146325,0.11565292332354578,0.12322687264477528,0.08929974168974789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918920992612942,0.09940695093571313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09323694878556836,0.13614184888628728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362569180022457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978069308549847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010088350113288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020612516905318,0.09498355505704467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09366064820616862,0.0,0.12311282349401935,0.0,0.11056749269122647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201070706397284,0.0,0.0,0.3865447999827727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23310184226965544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11418666671861907,0.0,0.054554661492414495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09493495222545274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923477257867793,0.0,0.23736785282259856,0.0,0.08279937084483988,0.0,0.1078483005506916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11892128727819433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10694573771244796,0.2272101592584789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11225577805333077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988814104512885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08880176429168976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2234944936060804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11902174057013433,0.17835418603328212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07418632886080946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13022738785474888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13432117368323127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658638553471252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10076174014369932,0.0,0.0,0.10764261999551196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,darthedar,2019/03/25,"Can anyone share experiences of autism as a working adult? I (25F) started counselling a few months ago for anxiety and depression. Last week my counsellor and I spoke about the possibility that I might be autustic.

I was informally assessed for autism around age 12 so this wasn't a big surprise. At age 12 my response had been I didn't feel I needed a diagnosis because the main benefits would be things like extra time in exams, which I didn't need, and I was in any case pretty high functioning.

However, as an adult I'm starting to wonder how much autism contributes to the burnouts and feelings of overwhelmedness that I experience so often - as well as stress I have around unclear guidance and structures in the workplace. 

I present pretty ""well"" socially and no friend who's only known me since around the age of 18 has ever agreed I could be autistic even though I've continued to feel like I could be. I'm not seeking a diagnosis here but I'm really curious to hear other people's experiences of life as a working adult and how autism affects this. I feel a lot of pressure even in just a 35hr/wk job and can't understand how anyone around me is managing it. Is this common? How understanding have you found people to be about reduced work schedules (if you have them)? I really want to ask for this but am scared people won't take me seriously.

Thank you.

autism,weemadrach,2019/03/25,"Time Alone I am 28 and was diagnosed with High Functioning ASD in December. Prior to this I was told I had Anxiety and depressive mood swings.
I also suffer from sensory overload quite a bit, usually sound or when there is too much in my line of sight.


I thrive on creativity but something weird happens to me.

I can only concentrate on things when I am totally alone. Even if it is just my fiance and me in the house. Even if he is in another room, it's like I go into auto pilot and can't think straight. 

It's getting to the point where I wish he would go out of the house more so I have the ability to focus on the things I want to do. Not limited to crafts either, even just tidying up!

My partner takes this personally when I ask him for some time by myself (he has ADHD and depression) and feels like I don't want to be around him anymore. I DO want to be around and with him, but I need the odd day or two completely to myself otherwise I can't focus on anything and my creativity dries up.

Anyone else ever have these feelings?

autism,JoseCFM,2019/03/26,"What to do if I dont want my younger brother to go to high school? So my little brother is 9 years old and was diagnosed with autism at 3 years old and has around 5 years before he goes to high school. By then I'll be 20 years old and out of high school.

There are around 8 special ed kids at my high school and 5 of them I'm pretty sure have autism. The special ed teachers are okay but sometimes they have to grab the students by the arm sometimes around the bicep area so they won't run off and they say ""oww"" in pain. I really dont want my brother to go through bullying and aggressive teachers. Kids at my school are very edgy and make so many jokes about autism and make fun of the autistic kids. 

Are there any alternatives for him not to go to high school?",2.9685849056603786,4.154310716981133,3.3070597484276725,94.95228773584907,73.90566037735849,6.557861635220128,23.94182389937107,6.816661863887847,0.4769408805031441,600,17,139,5,12,185,86,159,0.085,0.8140000000000001,0.1,0.1239,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,4,0,9,8,1,0,5,1,14,4,2,2,1,21,22,14,0,3,3,3,1,0,0,1,2,1,0,3,1,13,0,0,0,1,0,4,4,2,0,0,1,2,12,6,26,19,0,28,0,0,0,0,13,16,0,1,8,75,13,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06397959485099107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25126116988958913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08005761412618229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549215801211323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22052890453241394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16040843213670625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4970187204702287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09429577726964801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256021259780009,0.09538528865219424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2961725156193843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001108336346013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09571612764283292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060271911677622324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07481849432782306,0.0,0.5713014756149393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861007777289378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886720151274894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07762824154626273,0.1109850581686833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423451990463453
autism,DystopianAlice,2019/03/26,"Sudden shift in daughter with asperger's My 10 year old has ADHD and asperger's, does therapy which helps usually, was on concerta which stopped helping, switched to Adderall a month ago and that's been helping but I'm concerned about how the last 2 days have been.  On Monday she had a shutdown in the school cafeteria, they took her to the counselors office and she wouldn't talk or eat or interact.  She stayed shutdown for almost 4 hours after she got home and when I finally found out what triggered it, she said it was that she forgot that she doesn't like the strawberry milk at school and accidentally put it on her tray.  Today after homework and dinner she went to play on roblox and had an epic meltdown because a game she was expecting to be there was offline.  

I haven't seen anything like this since she was about 3 or 4 and we first started this whole process.  I don't know what to make of it at all.  Could it be the Adderall even though it's been a few weeks already?  Am I missing something that's making things worse for her all of the sudden?  Normally she doesn't do well with change, but it's been a long time since a small change triggered reactions of these proportions.",6.8406200265252,6.694296702586211,6.32344827586207,81.5125331564987,64.73275862068965,9.552254641909816,33.79442970822281,9.057496981413335,2.7234027851458884,953,37,186,14,13,294,135,232,0.095,0.8690000000000001,0.036000000000000004,-0.9195,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,1,0,1,1,8,5,0,0,13,0,23,4,0,5,2,33,36,16,0,4,5,1,0,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,19,12,4,2,2,2,0,3,5,1,1,1,18,2,21,4,25,14,4,36,0,1,1,0,24,10,0,4,24,125,40,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16357015539605868,0.0,0.12064768627192705,0.0,0.13628815954445175,0.0,0.15019377785655516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200171883781486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08296753041664852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879592600048685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10866770099316717,0.0,0.0,0.0877756038220127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1191052337118459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392680267749296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08989518656780934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14909491141654593,0.0,0.11576970722439665,0.0,0.14923064274473674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088545335524774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2736822514767234,0.0,0.13652307238875064,0.0,0.13403469322364764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747990144159635,0.11094265182218987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.132986750915141,0.0,0.0,0.12044745986829812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1817005054071649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10863664624516448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333526933539961,0.0,0.0,0.14281790045809453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368217745869377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12946575206232014,0.0,0.0,0.2754883487595187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.225172714935182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477925011051366,0.0,0.0,0.0963348740295487,0.14506839684898254,0.0,0.11378875757459092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10939496975411156,0.0,0.0,0.15564640154376655,0.0,0.0904212267808956,0.0,0.1337211590225094,0.0,0.07936314110104499,0.0,0.12901035946054673,0.0,0.15121617880917382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14989895751534255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10917414976012267,0.0,0.12237353949234715,0.12616946026073267,0.0,0.15195488051684955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13870126146252065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764629739912498

autism,UniverseKeeper,2019/03/26,"Feeling left behind I know I'm not the only person who feels like this but because of the way I am I tend to be more childish than my younger brother and such, which can painfully show when he and my mother are talking about bills and general more down to earth topics of the like.

This bugs me for everytime they talk about something like this I just happened to want to talk about trivial things like going outside or playing a video game together, something more light hearted but I tend to be overshadowed in these kinds of situations I feel and it just ends up having me feel depressed in the end. My brother is younger than me yet I feel he's ""out growing"" me so to speak and it's really taking its toll on my mental state. 

I feel like I'm going to be a kid forever and I'm really starting to hate it more and more it happens the feeling ""out grown"" and childish in normal situations. I just feel like I'm going to be a kid forever and I really do hate it. I can't entirely just stop being the way I am but, to be frank I understand how a certain character feels like more and more.

My mother doesn't entirely treat me like my age (23) for I guess it's because I live with her and my brother but still, it just doesn't really feel right. I wish i could describe it more but tight now I'm too depressed to think in depth.",2.8991711229946517,4.460827205882357,4.1987299465240655,86.98076203208556,74.73529411764707,7.298395721925132,26.701871657754012,8.00094639256281,1.5813176470588233,1048,39,217,16,22,345,129,272,0.12,0.735,0.145,0.0526,1,0,2,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,0,16,17,2,0,10,0,17,2,1,1,1,49,49,20,0,4,12,5,11,8,0,0,1,1,0,3,16,14,0,2,13,4,1,5,4,5,0,0,0,13,31,12,32,42,8,29,0,2,0,0,18,12,0,2,17,145,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11805739443683093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07731353201830163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16680480489414695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17153117171040586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4896183952574977,0.27671099194206145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16509783336769596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10667282651186433,0.0,0.17125878211368628,0.0,0.0,0.19120572541976336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11474795844482046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10083700870668726,0.05321706397699185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10520969285516606,0.0,0.0,0.3784629777171471,0.0,0.08550560159781434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09758521793250148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487610056275332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736461084777551,0.10303748692974364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455112589125117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2481356347258392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269513196468106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2176894328710437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14909405157623054,0.0,0.0,0.06853912707908381,0.0,0.0773312198351963,0.08095699708066027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07280661066726928,0.2334928802052447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433175955658113,0.0620468858294056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008069081677841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05711480498799906,0.15372357512337015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135354690353426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,fizzle_widget,2019/03/26,"Advice for parent of high-functioning PDD-NOS My son who is 19 has been diagnosed and dealing with PDD-NOS tending towards aspergers the majority of his life. Throughout school he did ""OK"" and graduated high school with average grades. He has always been fairly immature for his age (at 19 he acts more like a 14 year old).  He has tried two separate semesters at the local junior college and cannot hack it. I don't think there is enough structure for him. He has a part time job at Little Caesars and seems to do OK but is doing simple tasks such as dishes and making sauce.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really at a loss on how to assist him moving upwards/onwards.  College doesn't seem like the right choice right now. We can tell him to get more work (full time or another job). I'm not sure if there is a vocational school that he would fit in either. He has severe self-esteem and anxiety issues and I feel like the military would be a really bad idea as well.

autism,flipflop979,2019/03/26,"""A Boy Called Bat"" My son's (8 y/o) school gives a book to each child in the school for reading month, and this year's book was ""A Boy Called Bat"".  It's about a little boy who happens to be Autistic.  Let me tell you, I love this book.  Each chapter reveals different ""quirks"" Bat has.  For instance, his parents are divorced, but his father makes him chili one night, knowing Bat HATES chili - the father says something like, ""Well, maybe you will tonight?""  My first thought was, ""Oh honey"" and my husband and I laughed.  Anyway, if you're looking for a really cute book aimed at Grades 3-6, you may want to consider this.  It warms my heart to know the whole school is reading this!",4.457878787878787,5.344930848484847,4.075454545454549,91.96651515151518,70.06060606060606,6.775757575757575,28.303030303030305,6.42735559955562,1.0359030303030303,520,18,111,3,9,156,89,132,0.036000000000000004,0.813,0.151,0.9329,2,0,1,0,1,0,33.0,0,3,0,1,3,7,1,0,8,0,9,2,1,1,0,14,19,5,0,2,2,5,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,4,7,5,0,0,4,6,0,0,0,1,1,2,3,4,13,6,10,12,3,8,0,0,1,1,24,3,0,2,6,59,20,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3277913295542779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1676957265150037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13652723219748908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15397300761482888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419358723866743,0.0,0.0,0.15846750226663084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19020165138910985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1764209766811873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641293543033581,0.0,0.0784156471355183,0.16087025139115949,0.0,0.0,0.13478551450626136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14486389776748088,0.0,0.1071397159364044,0.0,0.16125092596367252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12811521237003246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506250126449769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876374494656066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17822410709207348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3211010120449917,0.0,0.10282493939976044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12764166476730573,0.0,0.487325173318754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235661845597402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1402902542784663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12742468518682493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09467122879321907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14431513253045075,0.0,0.0,0.17920041220846886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10336129099010842

autism,somaliaveteran,2019/03/26,"Question and concern for my 43 year old sister with a 3 year old non-verbal child:  I just visited my sister while I was in Austin. When I entered the home she was down to around 90 lbs, with large bags under her eyes. The child was running around between walking on the back of the couch to opening the back door going outside and my sister having to accompany the child with her husband to make sure the child does not throw rocks at the neighbors windows, pull phone cable off of the attached house, or get beneath the back deck and hurt itself. The child constantly runs back and forth to each person kissing your arm, knee or any exposed skin. The noises are quite unique as well. They have to sit in front of the doors to make sure the child does not accidentally go outside. The house was purchased new 4 years ago, and it is sparse now. No coffee tables, end tables, just one couch in the living room. The dining room has been cleared out. Nothing is on the walls. Everything they had nice has been put into storage. I need help understanding how an autistic child can hold a family hostage like this? My sister came to my car to see me off, and she got in...she broke into tears that she could not take it anymore.

autism,tiffanymtoma,2019/03/26,"Autism families Housing help-NYC I was wondering if there are any NYC families with a child/ren on the spectrum that know of any housing programs for us. I have worked since my son was diagnosed at 2 (now 10) however I just recently had another baby and it was difficult finding someone to put him on the bus while I commuted with the baby. Our lease is up in Dec of next year, however this time around we are looking to move somewhere we can afford. We are currently in Staten Island and prefer to stay since my son is already adjusting well here. It seems like we are always moving every 2 years because of the increase in rent :(   We are waiting to hear back from HRA but were already denied once ",4.648444444444447,6.136711955555558,5.583148148148148,79.0791666666667,70.18518518518519,8.955555555555557,32.01851851851852,9.3871,3.0818296296296293,554,25,100,12,10,182,96,135,0.057,0.906,0.037000000000000005,-0.5574,5,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,7,0,0,1,7,3,0,0,5,0,14,1,0,0,0,20,20,5,0,2,3,2,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,4,10,0,1,6,0,1,4,0,1,1,0,5,2,14,2,19,15,1,22,0,0,1,0,11,8,0,3,10,67,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3295988922572935,0.0,0.12426212144450895,0.0,0.0,0.20311146214418904,0.15659510141406754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13294348954848426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11483257464190895,0.0,0.09103574898012046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1515760757966398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12582465996994815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2815672863215643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13649326148430166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16831605582422876,0.0,0.10009887249719278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34463461621018104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207288159761437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295955666750352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12540725917345572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31744772738553273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588238614963888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15904130207740896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501270757820663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474543768131956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13595273732869287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470697470573151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12653456223758186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15917564490797995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08708084904138408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17963658860480566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342738149139692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16195191867986472,0.10872066698952207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19233900994750214

autism,WholeWheatBricks,2019/03/26,"Does anyone else have a ""detachment"" issue? It's really easy for me to detach and move on from my relationships with people. I chalked this up to moving around a lot during high school and feelings of isolation in middle school, but I recently burned a bridge with one of the closest people in my life. And it was just... So easy for me to move on. Just like everyone else that's no longer in my life.

I did this with my family too, and it's not like I had a bad relationship with any one of them. We're a decent family with struggles but overall care for each other. But I moved out, and it was just the same ole formula of ""out of sight, out of mind"" kind of thing. And I know I love them, I think... Well, maybe based on how I treat them (non communication, no visits home, hanging out,etc) maybe I actually don't...? They constantly have to be the one reaching out to me because I just don't have that ""aw I miss X person, I wonder how they're doing"" urge that reminds me to contact them.

Even in my current relationship, I've detach myself from the situation and I could feel that I could easily just move on from this person too despite them being the best and closest partner I've had yet. I don't know if this is related to my autism or if it's just some other weird neurological quirk I have that has helped me in some ways, but severely damages my ability/desire to have continuing relations with those that aren't here with me on the daily...

It's like, in the moment of being present with X person, I care and love them and feel like I would hurt if they ever left, but when it's time to part ways even for a little bit, all those sentiments go out the window. All I have left are my thoughts questioning why I don't care that they're gone.",7.134725766362884,5.407344467605637,7.64482187241094,77.44673570836787,64.88732394366198,11.057166528583265,31.304888152444075,9.916854025145753,2.6052336371168194,1366,37,290,24,17,454,165,355,0.077,0.7490000000000001,0.174,0.9916,1,1,0,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,8,1,19,19,0,1,14,1,26,5,0,2,3,63,42,23,0,6,16,0,3,4,1,1,3,0,2,4,23,25,0,0,9,0,0,9,8,6,1,3,7,4,44,13,50,29,10,46,0,3,1,2,21,25,0,9,14,209,67,3,0.0,0.0,0.0844442506729514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058845773339349136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06050626191635719,0.08866383594917654,0.0,0.077033195175943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722518898910091,0.05275004171314629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09081160964875876,0.0,0.094472211727526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26468012806718433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09351201319455188,0.0,0.1381799779136497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572608242046916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14457533485463572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09650776920387592,0.11430917173139026,0.07827453944296453,0.0,0.08268650406606005,0.0,0.0,0.1631522370597875,0.0,0.13126187087167795,0.061819576982278725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0491790039268057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05800160660861786,0.09142743413215394,0.0868001943308221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09263594237527384,0.0,0.0,0.0903185317646592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09011136389856164,0.09511313909742594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880378849020546,0.0,0.1222423942667453,0.1691036631521051,0.08672933845534506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07356771971138683,0.156199793445798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17386914004548748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08737420564596209,0.0,0.0,0.4598572826864709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17591209497530758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09370738924186328,0.0,0.11998291960245835,0.2266732434134876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969373669176665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05543560039057816,0.0,0.08544142949140338,0.2787139072714224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17515312093264818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775826737674792,0.0,0.0,0.09726732255304008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09046364257499813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748903770539366,0.055447197209205636,0.0,0.06869796344298656,0.0504584020103168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13737258964139856,0.0,0.0,0.07780404310444976,0.0,0.07808305879713541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09384193090730186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06147094277074789,0.0,0.0,0.0

Need advice on housing please. due to my sensitivity to sound and frequent meltdowns, I don't think apartment living is possible for me. I get about 700 dollars from ssi per month, and that's not really enough to get a house, plus i'd like to go to college (36yo).  


How do you not get upset or have meltdowns? I am afraid that the police will get me and kill me.

autism,xAstrologyx,2019/03/27,"Activities for Autism Awareness Week?? Good morning/afternoon/evening to all

Apologies if this isn't the right place. 

I am a 26 year old going through the process of diagnosis for Asperger's. My workplace is very good with awareness, and we are having sessions across our three sites all week. I am an autism champion, so it's my job this week to help people get as much information as I can. 

I will be delivering an awareness course next week and need to get together some ideas for activities. In the other sessions that get run, we have sensory activities to try and simulate what life can be like for someone on the spectrum. This includes noise when they're focusing, changing lights, changing plans at the last minute and trying to demonstrate heightened senses. I don't have access to the usual box of fun stuff that is used, so I am hoping to be able to get some more things to use. 

As well as the course, we will also have a stall set up to give information from. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for activities in either of these situations? My creativity isn't the best at times. 

Any ideas are very much appreciated. Obviously I will make sure to ask before doing things. I know how it feels to be triggered unexpectedly. 

Thank you. :)!",5.1780769230769215,7.025692192307693,5.667179487179487,77.58615384615386,69.38461538461539,8.78974358974359,30.09401709401709,9.2995712137729,2.6949247863247865,999,40,183,21,18,321,140,234,0.021,0.8320000000000001,0.146,0.9823,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,4,1,0,2,6,9,0,0,12,0,26,1,0,5,4,32,42,15,0,4,3,0,1,1,0,3,1,0,0,0,13,8,0,0,8,0,0,2,3,0,1,1,2,2,17,9,34,33,9,24,0,0,0,0,11,10,0,6,12,124,30,3,0.11773182115407925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09415009484158177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16012335116189244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232082675212114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11006336015143307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10018110844376027,0.0,0.12355228282505673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24908931219724825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07776075751701947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059528746220923676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24604006940514095,0.11293909069077593,0.06690970709274642,0.1974957316712412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07891315803929905,0.0,0.0,0.11693426298923244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39871468714929614,0.0,0.0,0.11683066617740412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647023299531656,0.09596714769742376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08315746702472114,0.057517820951892985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858690482292165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17309286989041947,0.08729665361126067,0.0,0.0,0.12520912743575371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12353974167720945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816204209694988,0.0,0.12300469516521632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005423319898418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13233549974712389,0.0,0.0,0.0997537900096512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347747681299927,0.0,0.0,0.11096084813884753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083916431496558,0.0,0.0,0.156431581234817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06865037168916964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15986435688782502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20336498594097024,0.12966496797480986,0.1942821646517489,0.0,0.0,0.3777494618232949,0.0,0.10585504624083353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12767513793834476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07581543283384741

autism,curiousobserver32,2019/03/27,"How can i help my friend learn how to drive? Hello, everyone, first post here on r/autism so go easy on me lol. 

I have a friend that's on the spectrum and trying to learn how to drive. The thing is, he's taken his test 3 times and failed each time. It's always hard hearing him talk about it because he clearly loves being behind the wheels and sees driving as a way to help him acheive more socially as well. 

I just have a regular car is the thing and I'm not sure how I can teach him to drive. I'm also not a driving instructor myself so I don't know what I can do. 

Any advice for me?

Thanks so much.

Other friends who know me outside and know a lot about autism think I show no signs but that might be because I am just good at coping in familiar settings.

autism,pounce-a-lot,2019/03/27,"Repetitive/restrictive behaviors? What exactly would be considered as this? 

My son likes to spin the wheels on his cars. He likes to drop circular objects so they spin. He likes to press buttons. But he will only do this for 1-2 minutes before moving on to something else. He also uses toys appropriately. He doesn’t become distressed at all if interrupted in these activities. Does this count? 

If not, can there be an autism diagnosis without this criteria? He has very poor joint attention and a speech delay but makes good eye contact.

autism,oliveisnotfood,2019/03/27,"A place for people with autism to go and be safe I need some help with opinions and ideas for what I think is a great idea.
Our schooling systems in Texas are not the best by far. I want to creat a group for children to go to after school and for adults to go to when ever. This group would something where these kids and adults can feel welcomed. Doing things such as short plays, arts and crafts, and even go on field trips to places that wouldn't normal go with a school group. I think this would be a good idea for people like my brother who is about to age out of the special class that he is involved in. With years of volunteer hours under my belt and working with these lovely people I want to give them a place to create more friends and consider another family. 
I'm about to go to college to become a special education teacher. I feel as if everything needs to be changed though. I do have a problem though, I have no idea where to start or even if I should start. I want to get some advice on the matter. 
Thank you, every little advice helps.
BTW I'm thinking of becoming a representative for these children in the government and make sure that they get what they need during the school year and such.

autism,VerucaMoon,2019/03/27,"My brother is having depressed thoughts My brother (24) who has high functioning autism recently expressed that he’s been having ‘existential dread’ and thinks often about how when you die, there is nothing after that. He asked me, “do you ever sometimes think, what’s the point in life when you’re just going to die one day?” And I really didn’t know how to answer the question in order to give him some positive food for thought in a way he can fully understand. 

Just to note, as soon as he started to talk about these things, my mother has taken him to a psychologist to get some more help, but he does not have any thoughts of suicide - rather just can’t comprehend life and death and what it all means (we are not religious and he doesn’t believe in god).

He struggles with conceptualising things like time, money and quantifying just how long he still has to live. Our father passed away a few years ago (from cancer at aged 48) and I think this is what made him realise his own mortality but doesn’t quite understand that a lot healthy people die just of old age (he is very healthy, doesn’t drink or smoke at all). 

I’m not sure how else to explain to him and help him understand that living his life with positivity and doing what you love is what life is all about, and that time spent worrying about what happens after death is taking away from the quality of the actual living part. I want to help take his mind off his negative/dark thoughts and give him some perspective that he can understand in his own way. 

What other ways could I verbalise these things without too much detail that can be easier for someone with his needs to absorb it and take it in? I know him well enough to think that what I’ve said so far has helped a little but I want to try and say it all in a way that I know he can comprehend and take solace in. I hate knowing he’s having these thoughts as they’re troubling him quite a bit.

autism,gymnastics66,2019/03/27,"3 year old brother confirmed to be on the spectrum from a very early age, my youngest brother has always preferred playing on his own. he could be amidst dozens of children and he always seems to be in his own little world. his speech is very much behind and he’s always had a few quirks that many advised my family to keep an eye on, however, we felt it was still to early for any judgement. upon starting at his new daycare, my brother saw a specialist— just last week it was finally confirmed he was on the spectrum. my brother will be 3 years old in August and I am 21 (an enormous age gap i know). he is my world, and I was just wondering is receiving a diagnosis at such an early age beneficial? my mother has begun a process of interviewing speech therapists to see who he likes and will respond best too. I was also wondering if his speech delays are normal? he can count, perform the alphabet and knows many words but can’t seem to form many sentences at all. 

any tips, education, and advice on how I can be the greatest sister to my angel of a brother is appreciated. :)",6.3618571428571435,6.279891899999999,7.136904761904763,75.06392857142859,65.71428571428571,9.666666666666668,34.64285714285714,9.2995712137729,3.1197142857142848,849,36,157,14,12,283,120,210,0.0,0.888,0.112,0.9711,1,0,0,1,0,0,22.0,1,0,0,2,7,3,0,0,13,0,25,1,1,1,1,27,36,11,0,4,4,7,1,1,0,2,0,3,0,1,4,8,0,2,8,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,8,7,18,3,24,20,8,35,1,0,3,0,26,15,0,5,20,109,22,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13739310245798456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11243810448895658,0.3509724362805338,0.0,0.0,0.19122621298848894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14755146566243707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11225799402312914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325455621664893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13499845158482024,0.15402088681097598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497211284206768,0.0,0.0,0.15454062681920833,0.11460810738922865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686902628515439,0.1409185571593339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4276402710798921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10335748585160626,0.0,0.0,0.1357927610631288,0.0,0.0,0.13775855858441646,0.0,0.0,0.2950729769654135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11204033055682464,0.255994682233432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951770042239104,0.0,0.11228367644626268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16324792354342285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2320201415220052,0.0,0.0,0.11278117544810001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3049503141618369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810841204821114
autism,seecucumberunder,2019/03/27,"Could there be a link to why I get food poisoning?? Or maybe I'm a bit more adventurous or have a worse judgement and it doesn't relate to autism??

Like compared to other people I get food poisoning several times a year.

If I remember correctly like maybe 5 incidents??? In the past year 

About more than 10 in the past 5 years?? Maybe even up to 15.

I've discussed with other people about food poisoning and these people just day it's been years since they've gotten it or like once a year. I'm Asian I'm supposed to have a strong stomach?? I live in a developed country. However I've never been exposed to the sanitary conditions they have in Asia. I've been to Mexico so I guess similar conditions, ate a fuckton of street food and I've never gotten sick until I ate an unwashed apple from the grocery store.

I think it's bad judgement now that I think about it not so much the autismo

So yeah, my nephew is a little jerk to my sister (his mom). ANYTHING she says to him is met with an angry “NO!” or yelling/growling defiance. Sometimes she’ll have me ask him the same question that she just did and he’ll respond nicely, “okay,” or “yes,” or just answer in a calm voice that he doesn’t want to do whatever it is. I don’t know how to help her. I understand his trouble communicating creates a lot of anger, but he’s just so disrespectful to her.

They don't need to be banned, but sending them a prewritten message from a mod and deleting their offending comments/posts would get the message across. Something that explains what talking over people actually means.

Frankly, it would help those of us with Autism stop spending much needed energy on them while also dealing with the problem.

autism,VividLotus,2019/03/28,"Homeschooling: yea or nay? I am specifically hoping to get feedback from autistic people themselves on this. I'll keep it brief: do you think homeschooling is the ideal option for autistic people, perhaps especially those whose conversational speech is very limited? If you are/were homeschooled, did/do you like it, or no?

Based on the fact that my daughter has been kicked out of literally every class or organized activity we've had her try, from daycare to preschool to even a social skills group specifically for autistic kids her age, I don't think at this point we can reasonably expect her to be in mainstream school when she's ready to start (she's preschool-age now), so I am trying to plan ahead and decide what might be best. I'm an engineer so quitting my job to homeschool her even for a few years would be a career-ender, so it's a really big decision, and my husband quitting his job instead isn't an option.",9.58377167630058,8.049780982658966,8.940859826589596,69.4775325144509,59.982658959537574,11.886994219653179,38.96604046242774,10.686352973137794,4.079601734104047,742,30,131,14,8,236,115,173,0.026,0.878,0.095,0.9108,2,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,1,3,0,8,8,4,0,0,8,1,16,0,0,1,1,23,23,10,0,5,4,2,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,1,9,4,0,2,5,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,1,17,4,19,16,2,14,0,0,0,0,18,7,0,8,7,86,26,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19778670759116526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16692769446504158,0.0,0.0,0.2489641446910947,0.0,0.1587933572062068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09846733332327301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18719235575750373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3740530288967676,0.16752000821389804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920764891896107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999359464960983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2613215064365957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17816423139290735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4009202038603932,0.0,0.0,0.12073814049767632,0.19377763874569545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19074080531981416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19212052731432602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13339940898058816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24152679648745176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2559163140254784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15550675718620194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13388305118889995,0.0,0.0,0.12136793025539085

autism,missmermaid91,2019/03/28,"Thank you! I have a kid who was diagnosed not terribly long ago. I am still gaining my footing as a parent for how best to get her assistance and how I can help her. I haven't been on this sub for long but I have learned so much. And I wanted to thank you all.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a small rant though.

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired of people telling me there is no way my child has ASD. That the doctors must be wrong because she is verbal and people with autism aren't verbal. Coworkers have even said, without ever meeting my kid, that she will outgrow it. They pity me. They ask if I can medicate her. They tell me how hard it must be as her parent.

&amp;#x200B;

You know what? It is hard being a parent to a child with ASD. But I wouldn't trade her for anyone. I love when she gets a big smile and rocks back and forth. I love seeing her spend hours doing her letter tracing over and over. I used to hate how she repeated herself over and over and over. Now I realize that she was using it as a calming technique and I just reaffirm her over and over now. I used to get frustrated because I can't stand the yelling and crying and hitting. I get overwhelmed myself and she has taught me that I need to learn how to calm myself too. She has me improving *myself*.

&amp;#x200B;

So thank you for sharing your perspectives and stories!",1.8375206149545809,4.104967784905662,2.709475890985328,93.1182459818309,80.58490566037736,5.435359888190078,22.645003494060106,6.605766666666668,0.5072823200559049,1033,34,215,10,27,325,135,265,0.116,0.722,0.162,0.9099,3,0,0,0,1,0,43.0,0,5,3,2,18,15,2,1,9,0,28,7,1,8,4,41,49,29,0,6,6,3,2,0,0,4,4,2,0,4,11,16,0,0,4,1,2,0,7,6,0,0,5,5,54,9,26,36,3,23,0,2,1,2,42,10,0,1,11,168,65,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696528794754241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763002075543394,0.42200841403045264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06071018827766821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08116982762316748,0.0,0.0,0.06676320801965367,0.0,0.10585565403088344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911176751787376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953733889451519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08812573532180126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886925614990122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05734721595651021,0.0785383508486991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18145030275770133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15555662346889085,0.08572189491098972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05819709144293533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855053178199153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047716851110940525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15367511334480818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15672623904838648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08746723961583236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382650135555472,0.06437977466757475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2892272792887099,0.0,0.0,0.12038730221409324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259063389216577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06918843130945636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06933870505706266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15177807767879573,0.2398108956007978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08530530362306099,0.0,0.0,0.0997927778862204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2249672483745468,0.0,0.0,0.051211743793702,0.06891779063172929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369638016845292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09492970996984214,0.42200841403045264,0.0
autism,AnxietyQueen1,2019/03/28,"I dunno where else to turn..... I need help. * long(ish) read but I only want opinions... * Hi... Probably in the wrong place here but this is the only way at the moment I can get any form of answers or anything rn....


Woke up early af to ring the doctors today as I need my tablets (ran out last night - yes It seems I've left it late but I've just changed doctors, only got registered properly yesterday) anyways they're closed....

This has set me off something bad, idk why. I have had quite a few meltdowns before when things get overwhelming, bad stuff happens (and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel), I cannot control my emotions, they just come out...


I've not been diagnosed with anything other than depression, anxiety and bpd so I have no answer for my meltdowns, just questions &amp; ponders on what's wrong with me... 


At the moment (for the past 3 hours on now - on and off) I've been crying, can't stay still, kicking/moving my legs/arms without really being able to help it atall(extremely strong urges to do so.. But now I've calmed abit I don't feel this urge) , I've reacted to every little noise I hear, my head is foggy and even now I've calmed down a little I still feel like I'm on the verge of tears &amp; melting down again.


Idk what to do, my doctors are closed and even then they don't listen to me regarding anything. I feel so alone, I feel like I'm just like a child having a tantrum but I honestly don't wanna feel like this, there's no show for anyone to see as I live alone
I'm 20 years old and I feel like I'm 2.
 I just want opinions, if anyone else thinks I'm just child-like when it comes to things that get too overbearing for me, i feel this subreddit would be less judgemental




I'm sorry if this is unrelated, I just feel so helpless.

autism,NIMSEP,2019/03/28,"My Flatmate got diagnosed with ASD, how can I help? So yeah, my flatmate just got diagnosed with middleish ASD, and I thought I should check if there's any general things I can do to make life a little easier on them.

For example, I have a very glib personality, and seeing as she is generally fairly critical and obsessive I will often return such criticism towards me with some sort of light hearted rebuttle or tease, as that's how I deal with people doing that sort of stuff in a way that I see as unecessary. Should I try to avoid responding in this way to her, or is that fine? Are there any other ways that a glib personality might be harmful or abrasive for someone with ASD that I should try to avoid? 

On the other side of that, is there anything I can do, such as engaging in interests etc, that would be of benefit to her that I might wanna put a bit of effort towards? Obviously I'm not her professional support network, but just little things that would make her life easier/better.

And lastly, what are the behaviors that I should be leanient about and just be conscious that it's likely not her fault that she's doing them? Like I have (a sad amount of) friends with severe depression, as well as a(n un)healthy amount myself, so I get that if they keep blowing me off or just acting negatively then I should give them the benefit of the doubt that it's not about how they feel about me. What are the similar things with ASD that I should keep in mind?

Thanks in advance :)

autism,J-IP,2019/03/28,"Dealing with schedule interruption I'm waiting for neurological investigation or what it's called for suspected hfa/adhd atm and genererally hang out in r/adhd for figuring out workarounds in everyday life but this things that came up today feels like this sub would be a better fit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bit of a stickler with planning. Since I struggle when it comes to building new routines or tweaking already working ones when external factors interrupt I'm having an enormous amount of problem handling that. After a few weeks of poor sleep, late night I'm turning that around again. This morning I was about to get early to work so my flex time would be a little better. Got stuck in traffic. I live in a quite rural place so traffic is only an issue if there is an accident. Early prognosis was that the road would open up after 1 hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unexpected things happen all the time and if I'm in the right mindset I can accept the,. No use getting worked up over something that you cant controll. But today I invested in planning out going early. Skipped breakfast at home to get away quicker and about to make a quick stop to get a sandwhich and had calculated how much flex time I would work in today despite planning on long lunch and going home early. And today when this happened it broke me. I can't explain it really so the closest approximation would be rage. Some quite honestly horrific thoughts about the person who caused my delay etc. It feels like an attack on my planning. I know how unreasonable this is, I think that while feeling this way but I can't control it.

&amp;#x200B;

If we take a less extreme example I get the same sort of weird emotional storm but at least with less intensity when planning chores etc and my wife goes of plan or doesn't respect it and in similar situations, say you are planning a day or event and almost before you are finished with it people seems to go off doing unrelated stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

This really messes me up because I don't know how to handle it at all. Today in traffic was worse because I had no outlet. If it's chores I can just dig in and go to work for an hour angrily until I burn off all my energy. I tried listening to mynoise and relax but I just couldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

autism,Lindaero,2019/03/28,"Neurotypical parents of autistic kids: stop dismissing the things autistic people have to say My god the amount of ""autism mums"" on this subreddit is infuriating. I'm not talking about the ones who want advice that is completely fine. I'm talking about the ones who think they are more of an expert on autistic people than actual autistic people are.

It's usually the type of parent who uses their child as sympathy bait and won't shut up about wanting to ""cure"" them. If you want to cure your child of autism you are a bad parent.

autism,yuirick,2019/03/28,"Pure stress, lack of sleep I don't know why it happens to me. I'm just kinda always stressed and I'm frequently tired mid-day even when I sleep like I should. Today, this is especially bad. I have a long day ahead of me and stressed out during my sleep and hence lost sleep and aaargh. Combine this with this weird... Stress that just keeps reappearing even when I've gotten time off. It feels like I'm really worried about something except I don't know what. Or like I'm working every day of the week, but I'm actually not. I want to relax. I want to wind down. But I just can't even when given the chance, and it's frustrating.

autism,joshd523,2019/03/28,"I’m starting to think I might be in the spectrum but I’m scared to open up about it. Just some context: I’m a 16 yr old and throughout my life I always enjoyed being alone, never hated being with people but never went out of my way to make friends. All of my friends I have now aren’t very close to me except for one or two of them, and my not so close friends are really a result from being in the same event as them and being forced to talk to them i.e band friends. In addition to those, I used to not be able to understand social cues and what people meant with words, but I’ve gotten way better at that now however I’m still really blunt with most things. I’m always really anxious when I’m with a lot of people, often fidgeting with my hands or something, and in the past year it’s been getting harder to talk to people clearly (I constantly trip over my words or go on long winded explanations of some small detail). If I’m ever really stressed or anxious for whatever reason, I always do this clap thing I can’t really explain via text and I look at the clock to see if the time is divisible by three (don’t really remember when that one started). I never even had a passing thought I could be autistic in any way because I didn’t know HF autism was a thing but after reading up on it and scoring an average of 30 on those AQ tests online, I’m starting to have second guesses. I’m scared to tell anyone though because my parents aren’t the most open minded people and they don’t really believe in mental illnesses (they only think of the extreme versions of them is what I mean) and I don’t want to think I’m doing this for attention or something...

autism,Pipamonium,2019/03/29,"How/When did you know? - as an adult being diagnosed. I ask because my husband has pointed out the possibility that I might be autistic and when I've tried to look up 'how do you know if you are autistic' and done little self survey things I've got to say a lot of it does sound like me and I score within the 'you might be/you are' range of the surveys. It's not that I don't want to be, or conversly that I *do* want to be. If I am, I am, if I'm not, I'm not. I don't really have anyone I feel comfortable talking to about it other than my husband so I'm coming here. I've considered looking into going through the process so I can know once and for all which way I go for my own peace of mind.  


My husband brought it up because of our son. We have three kids, an older daughter who's NT, a son who was diagnosed just before his third birthday - he had sudden onset symptoms that were 'moderate to severe' in nature and so he was diagnosed at 'level 3', and a younger daughter who's a toddler and we are becoming concerned that she may also be autistic due to a failure to meet certain milestones and that she's nearly 3 with a capability of speach but no desire to do so.My husband's primary reasonings are that I've been able to bond best with my son. I understand him on a level that I struggle to understand our eldest. I have none of the difficulties understanding our son's needs that my husband does and was able to compensate for needs he had and get him on the road to having his sensory perceptions evaluated before his professional therapists giving him early intervention realized there was anything 'wrong' there. He was found to have multiple hyposensitivities and poor proprioception - in the whole process I also got evaluated and was found to have mutliple hypersensitivities and I finally had confirmation I'm not a freak of nature and all my sensory stuff is not 'in my head' and oh god that was such a relief! My husband says our son's reactions to different things feel bizzare and impossible to predict to him - it makes him uncomfortable taking our son to most places on his own - he doens't want to end up upset or irritable with our son as he knows that wont help the situation and he hates the idea of our son thinking he's 'bad' for something he can't help. Whereas it all feels like common sense to me and obvious. When I think about it - helping him grow as a person feels more real to me than helping my elder daughter - I feel like my son and I connect heart to heart and while I don't love my daughter any differently I feel more like we connect mind to heart. Does that make sense? When I explained it to my husband he said that it sounded like how he feels about our son - that theoretically he knows and understands but that it's not the same as personally understanding.  


My husband's second main point is that as our son has grown I wanted to make sure that he understood that there is nothing wrong with him. My son is not dumb and he recognizes that other kids his age that are NT treat him differently. He's learned to change his stimming behaviours to more socially acceptable things so that he doesn't scare off potential friends. I encourage him to find ways to deal with living in a NT dominated world but I don't want him to think that he can't be himself while doing so. Does that make sense? So as part of this I've relaxed my own control on 'being normal' and just let myself relax and not worry myself about what others think. I didn't realize how much I actually did that until I stopped trying. It's been very freeing. So my husband asked if I knew how often I did 'flappy hands' (what he called it) and if I knew he was able to tell the difference between 'happy hands', 'upset/stressed hands', 'thinking hand', 'trouble wordfinding hands', and 'concentraing/focused'.  


So yeah - to those who were diagnosed as an adult. Basically what convinced you to seek out a diagnosis and how did you know to go looking in that direction?",6.69511177794449,6.418393877419355,7.334811702925732,74.57700825206305,65.06451612903226,10.460915228807202,34.410352588147035,10.043921644272036,3.288372243060765,3145,127,604,63,43,1044,309,775,0.056,0.8029999999999999,0.141,0.9966,3,0,1,0,0,0,57.0,12,6,0,2,30,30,2,3,26,1,64,15,9,11,6,132,126,65,0,14,20,25,12,5,1,4,5,6,0,7,54,39,0,2,37,2,2,7,19,10,0,3,30,21,90,21,88,84,18,51,0,0,3,1,112,27,1,13,20,417,144,2,0.18017100823699256,0.0,0.058606971352970126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960551267954204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04084082130942865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041993252714635214,0.0,0.04942179607141197,0.0,0.11229038093551333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050145088709949034,0.07322038288962159,0.06632824109351666,0.1022081718585923,0.0,0.06302611915895273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061324914578773336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635323456305314,0.051733790054943614,0.0,0.0,0.06735903532985929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191613273663865,0.0,0.24382637438749136,0.0,0.2509871415511021,0.0,0.0,0.21022515127892133,0.061459165154800925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05319267856983583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125663756946361,0.12871420428437716,0.0,0.0657895109447726,0.054891012485195366,0.0,0.0,0.1316988073016256,0.04639989134346351,0.0,0.03137730517323263,0.057612149487027024,0.10239533602359706,0.0,0.09606614281463767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0639317961781878,0.0,0.05929385657166099,0.06163581126276306,0.0,0.0,0.2135035122504185,0.16101977197253284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677970459363561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1980345484962456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06141235429386789,0.0,0.1467040897257355,0.06019289429188565,0.05303143371971801,0.0,0.15129826969112314,0.0,0.0,0.0510583160756217,0.05420378975989898,0.0,0.16035406273199992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274219783674073,0.12128090489224172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04414880726536535,0.08906301311278274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05884311138169414,0.05762631388078595,0.0,0.0,0.06395874787559992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06503588146136076,0.0,0.0,0.104878916581859,0.06274678538777552,0.0,0.11354655946691312,0.0677052468652573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06835801727574235,0.03847405380631772,0.06174860130222535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05712796252637226,0.09551947818987444,0.06012753677724812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06265255180933843,0.06784731855640982,0.0,0.0,0.06750658737590151,0.0,0.061220551142509676,0.0,0.04623481483329623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05021034346994386,0.0687950937337269,0.06278461904306386,0.06875089963176682,0.0,0.0,0.0566030143423556,0.062422221268392426,0.045155391878528094,0.048271543888133615,0.052492467519259074,0.0,0.0,0.06973080908079836,0.1196976120597767,0.19241051181968072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08154952523821793,0.0,0.0,0.31260728941097776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04955331694331557,0.17711588121339614,0.09534090671226246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06705149880631983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060990801524509475,0.0,0.0,0.1313258091922926,0.0,0.0
autism,kxvz,2019/03/29,"u/DaffodilsTigerlilies needs help. A few days ago, a team of people from around the world came together to free a slave. It took a lot of work, a lot of prayer, and a lot of work, but we did it. This person is u/DaffodilsTigerlilies. She has decided on a new name for herself, which is Katie.

Katie is a severely Autistic woman. She was subjected to horrific abuse by her parents, who told her that she was a slave and treated her as one. She was fed every two weeks. At age 18, she ran away. Traumatized and vulnerable, she trusted a stranger who offered her a place to live and stay safe from her parents. This person turned out to be part of a pedophile ring.  

Katie was trafficked to Flint, Michigan and brought back into slavery. Her new captor tried to use her to breed more children to be used in the pedophile ring. Her captor manipulated her into marrying him. She had six miscarriages spent another eight years without any friends except for two cats, a neighbor who occasionally saw her and treated her kindly but did not know what was happening, and people she befriended online by posting messages on Reddit via a stolen cell phone. 

I'm one of those friends and when I found out what was happening to Katie, I called the human trafficking hotline to ask for help. We made an escape plan and I took a plane to Flint to help because I knew she would be scared.  Because most people don't understand Autism very well, the agencies involved in the escape plan made many mistakes and almost got Katie, her cats, me, and my dog all killed or put back into slavery. 

Fortunately there was a miracle and we are all still alive and free. We are scared because no one is arrested yet, but we hope the police will catch them soon. In the meantime, Katie has a few wishes and I want to know if you can help grant any of them. 

NEEDS 

* Gas money to get away from Flint 
* Sunglasses 
* Yellow glasses 
* ANC headphones 
* Seed money found a nonprofit to help make life better for Autistic people, run by Autistic people, to be called Autism Shouts
* For Tom to be closer to where she is 
* A bra that fits 
* A place to live 
* A disability partner dog like mine
* Good shoes 
* For all slaves to be free 
* To start a residential school for Autistics run by Autistics, like the Deaf schools 
* A weighted blanket 
* To fix the phone screen 
* For everyone to get a mohawk to raise awareness of Autistic slavery  (see the photo for the one I got. Goodbye long hair, hello solidarity!)
* A veterinarian for the kitties 
* A lawyer 
* For people to listen to Autistic people about Autism 
* A computer with a keyboard to use to communicate 

WANTS 

* A school bus 
* A million dollars 
* A meeting with the president 
* To make life good for everyone in Flint 
* A farm with goat 
* To help her friends 
* A spinny skirt 
* A weighted lap pad 
* A search and rescue team for Dina the stuffed dinosaur 
* A rocking horse 
* An apology letter from all the people who put her in danger 
* A wooden train set 
* Her own phone 

Money raised will be used to grant Katie's wishes and hire people to help her get the nonprofit started. She is very intelligent and has a lot of big plans for her future. I want to help her make it as bright as possible to counter all the hell she has been through. She is too frightened still to accept help from any agencies or government workers, so we need to do this as a community.

Please see the pinned post on r/MutualAidNetwork if you can help directly. Please also share her story with everyone you know and go get a mohawk to show Katie how much we all love her!",2.1716895179124265,4.997792962406017,2.8810260946483868,88.3416364440513,85.54135338345864,5.655727554179567,23.462627156125606,7.1447894360817825,1.1265978770455547,2780,104,520,42,85,869,309,665,0.125,0.696,0.179,0.9848,2,0,0,0,1,0,89.0,7,3,2,9,16,28,3,2,60,0,38,9,2,11,6,91,90,33,1,13,10,2,3,2,5,3,3,5,1,6,16,36,3,1,9,4,8,11,4,6,1,9,27,14,57,25,98,53,17,57,1,0,6,1,94,24,1,11,20,336,73,15,0.0,0.06955812525395523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05204016102161613,0.0,0.05878652121058778,0.0,0.0,0.04694791950678398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11976819907862027,0.061559346390087026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05226162408351597,0.05488306497970219,0.0,0.11031420716604258,0.09028402773027942,0.0,0.10736161900486133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05192151854478857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989270117925326,0.06714510079549038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037861120240397006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049463129801384266,0.16829099386611204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12873826125917845,0.13607051096123102,0.0,0.12268781452968355,0.0,0.03336450747180126,0.0984811935562684,0.0939066073962822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382870808579067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3935002506252273,0.0,0.0,0.05830923883444662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06495053205860964,0.06113424498313224,0.0967913983619593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0829328971964116,0.057362491940103025,0.0,0.1036786089265304,0.05195379538454836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996421674295896,0.052985306323737116,0.11109985409568357,0.11756201695139472,0.0595196237543888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04315635654157945,0.13059135863375665,0.0,0.11339905888616038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1591253702743869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303742209629799,0.06357389615243902,0.0,0.3663000089601745,0.10252127289635896,0.12267251641731974,0.1288851837071033,0.0,0.06618325509656366,0.1124500427596212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11803338134009915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11755177889761625,0.1782436755153967,0.09356366232609167,0.0,0.0,0.06632213306264302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08310615000432607,0.0625737878980394,0.09376687783353144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05609699795537068,0.13045114311709727,0.03985815931360405,0.06385629368458698,0.11469630180800508,0.06111599599158606,0.0,0.20281579124311636,0.0,0.09687874922506898,0.10388062453706838,0.0,0.047091166921423226,0.14297847678994535,0.05278459037841215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350201697462672,0.05659139616110236,0.0,0.08547870448734295,0.0,0.0,0.04170372650136959,0.0,0.0,0.03780534522078295
autism,Rekington,2019/03/29,"Autism research from one Autsie to another.  

Hello Reddit community! My name is Carlos and I am conducting research for Florida International University in Miami, Florida. The subject of my research focuses on English literature intervention techniques and mitigation of any symptoms of autism. 

To collect this information, I set up a survey using SurveyMonkey , which asks five simple questions. The survey should take no longer than 1 minute and I would be forever grateful if individuals on the Spectrum can I share their experience through their answers on it.  You will not be asked for any personal information and no questions ask for long responses.

I myself am on the autism spectrum and am genuinely curious about how others in my situation have approached their challenges.

Thank you! :)

autism,MrCFodder,2019/03/29,"Helping my son with Exam Anxiety My son is 15 and has autism. We are very lucky that our local high school has a support unit where he can attend a mix of mainstream classes and additional support classes dependent on requirements. They also hold classes on social and life skills. The one thing that he is struggling with is anxiety and stress during exams. During his mock exams, on some he aced them, on others he frozen and written very little. How my wife and I dealt with exam pressure does not seem to have had an impact. Any advice I can pass on to my son would be gratefully received, I am feeling helpless and would hate to see my son's plans for the future disrupted by anxiety if there was something I could do.",6.888260869565219,7.068585760869567,6.870833333333337,76.52625000000002,64.57971014492753,9.218840579710145,33.19202898550725,8.841846274778883,2.8053594202898564,577,22,101,8,8,184,94,138,0.146,0.755,0.1,-0.7275,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,2,0,2,4,4,9,2,3,5,0,17,1,0,2,0,25,24,10,0,4,2,5,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,4,12,0,2,2,0,0,3,1,6,0,1,3,2,14,3,14,17,1,13,0,1,1,0,17,9,0,5,1,69,18,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773933282148227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14517300517004858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234496264989656,0.0,0.4166199891433677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14494045787030896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15886198889981654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178925414188646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17922765049205594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12167869102309607,0.1918010751644923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822312511337208,0.0,0.18194517348037528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123012416972979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837225184769976,0.14465942449943553,0.16526211241416414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18505147375326794,0.0,0.13975406075150507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20794705772553249,0.18977918470402347,0.0,0.0,0.41200620311591135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206033981674289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29956980649774057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25791367824590306,0.0,0.0,0.0

I guess I'll start from the beginning. I started to suspect that I was on the spectrum 3 years ago, I'm 35 and a man. I work with all types of ""mentally disabled"" adults and the the few there who have ASD got me to thinking and researching. Of course it became an obsession for me and it led to me realising that I too have ASD. I told my SO and she wasn't surprised. Neither was my mum who just said ""I know darl"". 

But to get to the point I've recently started wondering if my SO is also on the spectrum and after doing a significant amount of research (including lurking here) I am now 90% sure that she is. 

My query is, how should I go about bringing this up with her? Or should I at all?

autism,MaichenM,2019/03/29,"Fire Alarms need to change Look, I get it. Everyone needs to know when there might be a fire. The notification should be clear and unmistakable. The fire department should be automatically notified.

What I disagree with is the idea of having a switch in every public facility that can be pulled by anyone that, when pulled, produces extremely piercing noises and flashing lights. It’s like someone went out of their way to try to trigger a sensory overload. Maybe the lights can pulse, or the sound can be less piercing but still unmistakable. Maybe the lights could be a distinct color that is only used for fire alarms. It could be anything so long as it’s immediately identifiable.

But in its current form it’s just inhumane to anyone with sensory issues, especially when there are drills, and it needs to change.",7.226137931034483,8.881602958620693,6.9105172413793134,71.34370689655175,64.24137931034483,9.937931034482759,32.43103448275862,10.125756701596842,3.3960896551724136,659,26,110,15,10,207,88,145,0.11,0.866,0.024,-0.8555,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,1,8,3,0,2,10,0,19,0,0,3,2,25,27,11,0,7,4,0,4,1,0,3,0,1,0,0,11,6,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,1,10,3,1,16,14,2,14,0,0,2,0,2,3,0,2,7,75,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2524380463706223,0.0,0.14854697888223484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3819180505330333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2882501956597284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15209015237882678,0.1724880936828282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09431069405520416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037774251755976,0.0,0.18840887692956196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992053312230836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08818962907352595,0.0,0.0,0.15974849728318669,0.15158562051077532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626995342886775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19149597378376965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4015447407739697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13728841914288234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15294824445779026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1441580708201518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12255661030523675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559054426946848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14328297210744154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16733754038251578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Hornyculture,2019/03/29,"Some advice would be nice Hey y'all. So to start, I'm an autistic 18 year old guy. I'm in community college right now knocking out my prerequisites, and eventually I would like to study abroad. My parents, however, are less than thrilled to say the least. They don't want me travelling to a ""strange country like Iceland"" (even though it's one of the safest countries in the world but I digress) because I had a pretty bad meltdown like... 8 months ago. I can put up with a lot of stimulation and I know when to remove myself from a situation, so meltdowns are incredibly rare for me. However, my parents were being really hostile towards me, and when my dad grabbed me I kicked him away. Whenever I try to vent my frustrations I normally get ""that's life"" or some other dismissive response. I just want to make my own decisions every once in awhile is all. How do I bring this up with my parents without them thinking I'm being hostile towards them?",4.046007326007327,5.990839131868133,5.091450549450549,80.17021611721613,72.51648351648352,8.15003663003663,32.46300366300366,8.841846274778883,2.8878142124542117,750,37,139,15,15,246,123,182,0.112,0.8140000000000001,0.07400000000000001,-0.8365,5,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,1,3,0,9,9,3,0,8,0,13,1,0,3,1,25,24,11,0,5,4,4,1,3,0,2,1,1,0,1,4,6,0,0,3,1,0,4,2,4,0,1,2,2,27,5,24,17,7,23,0,0,0,0,12,11,0,4,11,98,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15900259123671415,0.1442364641773134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528754992086254,0.0,0.13585969558024033,0.09918916473747262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10747130142120076,0.0,0.13709386769060392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501153829084566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16111280016947102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0894235579370315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492996582603147,0.23848205457329566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13833393174349629,0.0,0.0,0.10861310004773156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298770512611991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1594255271050106,0.0,0.0,0.1707413512835536,0.1732854849720971,0.11025946268570253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5420251287393499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655390028935228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635728756903419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10423898675498873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1389571759830882,0.0,0.12939699143741865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18289776020939053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11517006281969755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10426079297003453,0.1598660343939552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11047237086031143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19194629283249276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568508383697061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23117522834246085,0.0,0.0,0.10478271424608833
autism,Brokenparanoia893,2019/03/29,"So I'm currently going through the pre-screening process And I'm not sure how to feel. It's a little bit shocking, and I am not sure if I really want to accept this. I started the diagnostic process before, but I quit because I was too afraid to accept that I may have been born differently. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now learning that I was nonverbal up until 3ish, and that my mother really worked with me to me to talk (she's definitely the reason why I've made it so far). Even then, I still struggled well into adult hood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt like I was different. There was so many years of people laughing at me and I never understood why. So many situations where people act weird the next day, and I have no clue why. I've had so many emotional struggles, it's not even funny. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always the last to laugh at jokes, and that's if I get it at all. I offend people without meaning to. I misunderstand and miscommunicate constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

The sad thing? I've masked it for 27 years. I'm an educated black male (Masters in Public Health) who grew up in a pretty rough place, but overcame my circumstances through sheer luck, amazing people, and constant work. I now work at a University as a research coordinator. And while I had more issues than I could list off here in a reasonable length, they've all been easier than accepting that I am more than likely autistic (I've had a few professionals suspect this). 

&amp;#x200B;

How did you guys deal with this when you were going through your diagnosis? What did you do to accept yourself? I apologize for the word dump. I'm just not sure how to process this all.

autism,HESAHodgesmj,2019/03/29,"Faith and Autism I am going through a time where I am questioning my beliefs. I am not certain about my faith and believe everything I was taught. Coming from a Christian paradigm, were taught that faith is believing without seeing but I have a hard time conceptualizing that. It's like, how do you believe without seeing? I deal with worry enough as it is and I cannot help it. I am wired that way to think about other things to be concerned. It's a natural recurring pattern for me. If I am wanting to be a Christian basically it's saying give up worry and let things happen the way they are. However, trust is a big issue for me becasue of worry and anxiety. My question is how have you believed your faith and come to believe it? Also what is your stance with faith and disability?

autism,Netlogicc,2019/03/29,"Am I the only One ?: I make up real-life situations in my head then I stress about them. Hello everyone, my name is T and I have high Functioning Autism or asperger syndrome plus I stutter  and I have ADD. I make up real life situations in my head then I stress over them in my head. 

For an example: I was being drag to this party and my anchor broke away from me so now I’m in the sea of unknowns and my anxiety is through the roof ! So I always go to my plan A : Go over to the table with all the food and stuff my face until I’m full. If people come over to talk to me I stuff my cheeks with pretzels and that usual scares them away. If plan A fails then I go to plan B : Drink all the non-alcoholic drinks then spend the whole in the time of the party in the bathroom playing on my phone. The music is blasting and people are dancing all up on each other my innocent self just want to hide in the kitchen with all the food but it seems like I have a shadow following me so I try to shake him off like the cops In GTA 5, I turn left he turns left I turn right but maybe I’m overacting and he just follow to the kitchen as I tell myself before reaching the kitchen let out a sigh of relief as I grab one of the little deli sandwiches they have on the counter and you know who was there the guy who was tailgating me and flash his headlights as I pull my hand back as Plan A has crashed and burn so I start plan B and start to drink until I can’t anymore so bum rush people until I reach the bathroom and locked door behind me. Before I can think about it anymore I brought back in reality by my mom calling me asking me what should she cook for dinner.

During the awards part of the ceremony (held at a pizza and games joint like Chuck-e-cheese) the coach announces my twin boys (who are somewhat tall), “Andrew and Joel, the Twin Towers!”

And their good friend, who’s on the spectrum, turns to the kid next to him, giggles, and says, “Hehe. Get it? Like 9/11?” and my wife and I lost it. I love an autistic sense of humor.

autism,walkthroughthefire,2019/03/30,"Weighted blankets and pets? I’ve been thinking about getting a weighted blanket for awhile and I was about to ask my boyfriend to get me one for my birthday, but it just occurred to me that it might not be safe for my cats. One of them in particular loves to sleep under the blankets with me and she’s a tiny little thing (maybe 8 lbs) so I’m scared it might be unsafe if it restricts her breathing or she can’t get out from under the blanket while I’m sleeping. I was leaning towards a 20 lb blaket (I’m ~140, but I’ve heard a lot of people say they found 10% of their body weight too light) but now I’m not sure I should get one at all. I’ve never actually had the chance to use one in person, so I’m not sure how heavy it would actually feel with all that weight evenly distributed. For people who’ve used them and/or have small pets, do you think it would be fine? Or should I go with a lighter one or none at all? I *could* always get one and just use it when I’m awake for sensory overload, etc., but I have pretty bad insomnia a lot of nights and was hoping maybe it could help with that too.

autism,doingsomething,2019/03/30,"Opinions on adult living “send them to a farm”? I’m curious to know peoples opinions on choices for adults who are ASD. A discussion I had with some folks about Special Olympics getting funding cut, one comment that came up was “if they had their way, their solution is to just send them to a farm”. Presumably I took that to mean the solution people have is to send ASD people “away” to live/work on a farm so society wouldn’t have to deal with it.

autism,p1morris,2019/03/30,"Sports and autism/ADHD and lack of motivation This is my first time posting to this community and I really hope that there are some ideas that will help me better understand what my son is going through and how to support him.

My son is 6 years old. He was diagnosed with ASD at 2 years old and later with ADHD. Over the years, we’ve had him in speech therapy, OT, DIR, and socialization classes. He graduated from speech and OT (though he still struggles with speech) but participates in socialization once a week. All of this has really helped him to obtain the skills that he needs to be independent and highly functional. We also started him on medication for ADHD (currently on Metadate CD which seems to be working well for him).

To give him opportunities to socialize and burn some of his energy, we’ve enrolled him in different sports over the years. Initially, I took him to a tots soccer class, ballet, kung fu - we tried them all (before he started medication), and it just seemed a bit too difficult for him and he really didn’t seem to enjoy it. When we enrolled him in swimming, he really excelled. Even before medication, he picked up the different strokes quickly despite what appeared to be a complete lack of attention. We have since enrolled him in the swim team and, it’s been more challenging, but he’s doing well. Lately, it’s been getting warmer, but he’s been protesting more about having to go. His reason is that it’s just too cold. We got him a large parka, I greet him when he gets out of the pool with a towel, and hand him a hot chocolate. But it’s hard to tell if he’s just really getting bored with it. But when he’s in the pool, he’s paying attention and laughing with the other kids when his coach starts joking with them. When he swims, he seems more peaceful at the end of the day and falls asleep much easier.

It’s challenging to know whether we’re pushing him to grow as an individual or traumatizing him. His lack of motivation, right now, is very similar to what I might expect in neurotypical kids. Because of his rigidity, I’m concerned that if I push him too hard to keep going I’m going to remove any fun that he gets from it. 

My question: Did any of you with autism/ADHD participate in sports as you were growing up? Looking back, would you have appreciated someone to continue pushing to get better at it because it helped you to stay competitive with peers? What made you feel supported?

3. As you grew (or are growing) into adulthood, has your ability to  verbalize changed at all? 
4. What media tropes and stereotypes about you are unrealistic?
5. Are there any pieces of media that get certain aspects of the semi to non-verbal experience correct? 
6. Have people's expectations changed as you grew (or are growing ) into adulthood? 

Thank you for all your help!",3.6816999999999993,6.347431770000004,4.712,79.09100000000002,76.3,7.0,27.0,8.07648339933343,2.0824,854,34,145,15,20,278,118,200,0.0,0.802,0.198,0.9907,0,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,0,12,0,1,9,6,0,0,7,0,14,0,0,3,5,34,26,15,0,6,7,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,0,3,9,7,0,0,5,1,1,6,0,0,0,1,1,5,16,7,30,23,8,12,1,0,0,0,23,6,0,10,1,100,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17481343010853512,0.1960475623194366,0.1097177415056214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426934309967433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34135579313274866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799384029458341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734687899893591,0.0,0.0,0.08157910189398324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08429426607405062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18184357799618955,0.0,0.1081437955466499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866905996034799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882329922992883,0.1617065525287962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11860455465925154,0.11963266576331212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2237077399275093,0.0,0.0,0.17710449909075382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36147877280410107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15347269776291933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485415612172595,0.0,0.0,0.10718811259379853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954027665363464,0.0,0.15760718567489715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13312362104426265,0.19032677452081928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960475623194366,0.0

autism,clitorophagy,2019/03/31,"Have you tried limiting oxalates? Or taking supplements? I've been reading about how oxalate crystals form in the body and can cause various problems from kidney stones to exacerbating problematic autism symptoms.  

I like being on the spectrum for some reasons, I like having special interests and being honest for example,  but I don't like some other ones like meltdowns.

I like to eat what I like but if it will help me feel more steady and less stress I will try. Also there are supplements like b6 and magnesium and probiotics- so many things that might be good but also might be a waste of money and pill swallowing.

autism,Inspectreknight,2019/03/31,"Dies anyone know/ have a good idea about what the cause of autism is? Title is self-explanatory, but here is backstory nonetheless. I am autistic myself, and I know quite a lot about how my autism affects me and how it could affect others, but I still don’t know anything about why people have autism. I had attempted to ask my Biology teacher (a doctor of Biology (I know that does not mean he knows everything about it)), but I was essentially brushed off, and I am still curious, especially with the oncoming of Autism Awareness Day.

As far as I am aware, autism is not caused by any mutation of the genes, showing it can’t be genetic, yet all of my siblings and most of the maternal side of my family have autism, including my mother, implying it might be passed down in some way.

While I think ABA is great, I’m recently learning that there are people on the spectrum that disagree and believe it’s abusive. Because I’m working with autistic children I want to make sure I avoid making them feel a negative way about ABA. I don’t want it to feel abusive. What makes you feel it’s abusive and how would you change the ABA practice if you could? Thanks!!

autism,the1wtheFlippityHair,2019/03/31,"I really suspect I am in the autism spectrum, and if not then something else is ""wrong"" with me. These symptoms have great effects on others and my life, and I need to know why I'm like this because I know it's more than just me being a quirky socially awkward introvert. Please help? I have generalized anxiety disorder, depression, gender dysphoria. But for a long time I've suspected I am on the autism spectrum because:
- I'm highly individual 
- have trouble connecting with others 
- and understanding social cues and expectations
- I sometimes have trouble understanding metaphors but according to my parents it's all the time and they say I always take things too literally 
- I have this need to correct others- to me I'm helping them, but often they see it as rude....
- my parents say that I don't show emotions like I should(but I definitely do feel emotion) and I usually have a blank expression, and I don't seem like I fully understand how bad and wrong or even dangerous a mistake I make is, and I barely understand how it effects others
- I naturally am bad at eye contact when people are speaking to me, and I usually don't even look at the person a lot of the time when talking to them. I just naturally do it, but I try to do better at this and when I think I'm doing better I get told I'm still not making eye contact like I should.
- I've always had a hard time in social situations, they make me nervous, I like parties in theory but I always end up uncomfortable at them (this is probably just an introvert thing though)
- I have a hard time understanding social expectations and not understanding how some things I do are ""not socially acceptable"", ""really weird"" or just plain rude.
- I'm super book smart but according to my parents I'm really dumb when it comes to ""common sense"". Even though I think my actions make sense, they say otherwise. 
- My parents also say that I act as if I think the world revolves around me which I deny and I don't really understand what they mean (oh wait..... it's a metaphor, of course I have trouble understanding it)
- I never truly feel part of a group, even when my mates really want me in their group(which is rare), I never fully believe them. I never fully feel like a belong in any social group
- I have a few really strong interests (art, sciences, geography, language learning and creation...) and I get really frustrated and sad when I can't pursue then, and I often ramble on about them(I ramble about anything I'm interested in) and love to tell others about my strong interests but I can't tell that they are getting bored right away, sometimes of the time I never do. My friends, parents, siblings, can all confirm...
- also I don't understand how they can get bored of what I'm talking about, and I get told I don't know when to shut up when I'm talking about a very strong interest of mine which sounds selfish I know but I'm being honest.
- which is ironic because I am very quiet most of the time(unless my friends are near) and often I will do gestures rather than talking in full sentences
- I'm sensitive to loud noises and a few specific sounds that aren't even loud but to me they are really loud; and I'm really sensitive to touch- My mom likes to touch me a lot (just my shoulders, arms, upper back; you know, normal places) but I hate it but she doesn't understand why I'm so sensitive. I don't like anyone touching me unless I really really like them but even then I still have limits
- I always like to do my in thing, which is not a bad thing, until it gets to the point where others are annoyed, angry, or hurt because of my extreme stubbornness and my lack of agreeableness that amplifies when I'm really stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed
- I am very detail oriented, and I will often get fixated or obsess on little details, and I get upset when a pattern or order is messed up and I will go out of my way to fix it if I can but if I can't then I get even more upset. I don't have OCD, but I do have this need to be in control and do things my way or it will be wrong.
- I have a routine. I don't like changing my routine. It is hard to change it even when it's better if I do. I like things done in a certain way and I get upset if I can't do it my way.
- I'm really clumsy- I drop my phone A LOT- it just falls out of my hands! I wish I could say I'm really coordinated but I'm really not that much. Yeah I can sing and play the drums at the same time, but for most every action, I'm slow. I'm not well coordinated in most actions.
- according to my mother, I'm often ""in my own little world"" or on another planet, and seem lose full awareness of my surroundings a lot. I actually disagree, I think I am very much aware or more aware than most people of my surroundings. 
- I hate it when things are unrealistic. It bugs me so much. I hate exaggerations. 
- I also hate it when people are not straight forward to me. I'm very straight forward, that's what I think is the right way to speak, but again to other people I'm being rude.

Even after all this my parents still think I am not on the autism spectrum; and I've done a lot of research on it to know that it's under diagnosed, it's a wide spectrum and everybody does not experience the same symptoms and levels, and there's a stigma to it which is all probably responsible for my parents just seeing me as a really quirky socially awkward introvert, but all these symptoms make my life difficult and impair my social abilities and I'm unable to see specialists in autism. I just need to know why I'm like this.

autism,starannisa,2019/04/01,"My son Hi I have wanted to make this post for a while. 

I shall add the disclaimer at the beginning. I am a mother to a 6 year old on the Spectrum. I myself am not on the spectrum. He is ‘low functioning’ or is level 3 on the spectrum (whatever you make of that). I value immensely the input of adults who are on the spectrum and would never for one minute pretend to know more about you than you know about yourself. 

This is where I air my grievances. 

I feel sometimes that some people who have ASD speak in terms of their experiences but not only  for themselves but for all other people on the spectrum. I sometimes feel like my sons already stifled voice is being more and more pushed aside. 

Let me explain. As much as I think this world should accept everyone as they are (if they are not harming others) it doesn’t. So saying please don’t try to change your sons ‘unacceptable’ behaviours, the world should just accept them, in all theory is great and I agree with that sentiment. But the world doesn’t and won’t. I want my son to coexist with the world around him, so toning down some of his behaviours at certain times is something I have to teach him. It’s what we as humans do all the time. I’m not the same person at work as I am at home. This is where ABA comes in. Not the traditional ABA which just focuses on pure compliance. An ABA which incorporates methods to help encourage speech. An ABA that helps the participant learn how to stim in a way that won’t interfere too much with whatever task is on hand. An ABA which incorporates a sensory diet into the child’s day in a way that is not too distracting but will help regulate the child and help them feel safe and happy in his environment. Then I want my son to not only be compliant but also air his grievances in whatever way he knows. I want him to be encouraged to communicate his needs in a way comfortable to him but also a way others will understand. Sometimes what he wants to do isn’t what he can be doing or isn’t what’s best for him so he needs to be told no and he needs to understand it. I as a mother have a job to raise him (as I raise all my children) to be able to live in the world and become a member of society, not just the autism community. 

I am sorry that this post is taking the focus away from my child. This is not my intention. I’m a mum, my focus is always on my children.  My son is an amazing person. Not because he has autism but because he is. All my effort is to try and give him a voice which he can then use any way he wants. Right now he is not understood enough for his voice to be effective. 

Please let me know what you think.

autism,kittiefeather,2019/04/01,"Adult Seeking Formal Diagnosis Hi everyone, this is my first time posting and the first time being open about this situation. I am 21 years old and heavily suspect I have been living with undiagnosed autism. Recently I found a few autistic youtubers who led me down a rabbit hole of researching symptoms and common experiences of autistic individuals. To say that I relate to many of these feelings and experiences would be an understatement. I have been considering seeking a formal diagnosis for months now, but I have run into a few roadblocks to me even getting to a professional. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I have three main issues. The first is, I live in the southeastern US (Alabama). The second is, I am an adult and every clinic I've found is directed solely to children; these clinics also seem to heavily support ""curing"" autism and assimilating autistic children into fully neurotypical behaviors. The last issue is that I need a clinic that is LGBTQ+ friendly (please I am aware that I live in the bible belt, but I really need it to be safe for me). 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations on where to go, or where to start looking? Are there any questions you wish you asked your clinic, or any red flags to look for? Literally any other suggestions or expectations?

I am a Special Education teacher and had a parent of a student on the spectrum ask me about this. This student struggles with hyperactivity, self-harm, and frequent tantrums. She is on abilify but it has not had the positive effects they were hoping for. It just seems like there is a motor in her brain that won’t shut off and she’s miserable. Thank you for your help!

autism,WallaWallaHawkFan,2019/04/01,"Feeling very discouraged. I feel so lost right now. 

My son who is 5 always says he loves me and his mom and his cousins but always forgets about his little sister (3 and on the spectrum) unless I ask him to say he loves her too.

He tries playing with her but she loses focus very quickly. He asks me why she doesn't talk and I keep saying she will but it might be when she is a little older.

I am very worried about her not being verbal yet. She has said maybe 3 words and I am not sure if she is just mimicking the sounds we make or if she actually knows the words. She knows how to clap and wave when we get her attention and say ""clap"" or ""hi."" 

The concerns for my daughter are consuming my life. I feel like I can't help her I don't know how or what to do or where to start. Will she ever talk? When does verbalization begin?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you.",1.3009951159951143,3.3385761813186825,2.8764102564102565,92.44914529914531,81.14285714285714,5.5829059829059835,19.45177045177045,6.691623216298621,0.0582700854700855,683,17,151,7,18,224,110,182,0.079,0.802,0.119,0.8659,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,2,1,0,2,15,10,0,0,5,0,18,3,0,3,2,42,36,23,0,3,13,5,3,1,0,4,1,6,0,0,3,10,0,2,7,1,0,0,5,3,0,0,2,9,34,7,10,27,0,15,0,3,0,2,44,5,0,7,11,101,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.12769922865508396,0.0,0.0,0.12787362120700385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217769866502873,0.0,0.0,0.08898841312655288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24467046666665698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11451534281022055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11836919897496627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1984982935908224,0.09348549171209862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06836827727822725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14427219459465154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771183787706464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631323795088225,0.0,0.0,0.21574958154484786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09242937993062328,0.06393095792544565,0.26230961928733953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14639742904755032,0.14284774490790236,0.0,0.23621019761740866,0.0,0.08734920799463726,0.0,0.13146516721856244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13882041654416666,0.0,0.15326014473823674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11175262709525886,0.1244766037357187,0.4162564078911379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262247157637694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12333278966999806,0.0,0.0,0.21035855558478028,0.0,0.12047712279410512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08884447728402342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3239164320325321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807963597239485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328933765034161,0.0,0.09295827618776782,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,aspieminded,2019/04/01,"#REDinstead for April April is Autism Awareness Month.

Neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences (like Autism, Aspergers, Sensory Processing Disorder, ETC) are a normal, natural variation of the human genome. My condition is not the result of an illness, injury, disability, disease or vaccine – this is the way I was born. It’s my genetic predisposition, and I don’t believe that I, or others like me, need to be cured. Rather so, neurodiverse individuals need understanding – and at times, different accommodations. So let’s forgo “Light It Up Blue” and go “Red Instead” for April to highlight Autism *Acceptance.*

autism,dyslexic_jedi,2019/04/01,"Sharing Our Story (Prepare for a long one)
Our son was diagnosed with ASD just after his second birthday, but we had suspicions for a quite a while before that. We got him settled in a ECSE (Early Childhood Special Education) program through the county, a private speech therapist, and started him with an ABA program. This story is about the ABA provider we chose to help him.

They started off by saying all the right things during the interview and testing, and we thought they could really help him. Next we met our technician, and we thought well she has to be here for a reason, she has to be good with kids and trained etc otherwise they wouldn't have sent her. Later we found out that she had just been hired and had no experience. They would bring the same ""toys"" every time, which they had purchased at the dollar store (think plastic wiggle snakes and other fidget type toys). At first the sessions seemed fine, but degraded over the next 3 months to the point my son cried the entire 3 hours non-stop and refused to leave our sight when she showed up. We caught her texting when they were supposed to be working. They continued the same ""programs"" for all of those 3 months, ie ready,set,go and 1,2,3. 

At this point, we started getting very conflicting information. His ECSE teacher says he is the model student, and that he is her ""little leader"". He understand what she says and which stations to go to and what's expected at each station. His speech therapist says he is a very smart boy and figures things out very quickly. We talked to the ABA supervisor over and over, offered to let them speak to the school and the speech therapist, even to attend a speech session. They never made any effort to contact anyone even after filling out all the forms. Finally, the tech supervisor said ""ABA isn't for everyone"", they kept expecting our son to adapt to their program and their way of teaching, Not the other way around.

(Now the good). Then we switched ABA companies, we took a good month break as to not associate the old company with the new company in his mind. The new company has been here 2 months, and they are AMAZING. They have already started several programs about taking shoes on and off, letters, numbers, speech, and other life skills. He loves when they show up and can't get to play with them fast enough. They bring new toys each time, and it's toys he loves (paw patrol, cars and trucks, and farm animals). 

(The moral). If you think something is wrong, it probably is. Stand up for your kid, don't be afraid to call people out, switch companies, etc. Your kid knows when something is right or not.

autism,cakeslady,2019/04/01,Im so glad this page and all who are a part of it exist Im autistic and I am constantly feeling bad about myself because I'm autistic. Im fairly open minded and I know I shouldn't feel this way but it's so engrained in me by society. Also I can tell there are many times when I cause people I love stress because I'm panicking and losing my composure. I'm just glad that there are spaces like this where I can see some validation and acceptance. I really need some community. I feel really alone  I don't like feeling like I'm an outcast just because I'm different.

autism,Mystery_Tragic,2019/04/01,"I'd much rather read a post from some who is a parent of a child/adult with autism, than someone who has autism Or someone who knows someone with autism. Like a friend, family member, or maybe someone employed looking after people with autism.

And I say this as someone who has autism myself.

Why do I think that way?

Well, let me make it clear first off it's not that I don't find value reading posts from people with autism. I enjoy reading the perspectives of those who have autism. What they feel, what they want to happen in the future, and their perspectives on many things relating to autism. The voice of people with autism is important, and I hope that myself and others who have this disability can continue to advocate for ourselves.

However, for me, personally, I've found the more interesting perspectives to be from someone who knows someone with autism. Whether it be a parent of a child with autism, or someone who is a friend with a person with autism, their way of looking at things can be quite illuminating.

Everyone has their blind spots, and I think people with autism like myself have them more than most. Which is why I like reading people who know people with autism because they can fill in that blind spot for me.",7.689632107023409,7.835795347826085,6.598695652173912,79.26513377926423,62.91304347826088,9.51170568561873,30.735785953177253,9.057496981413335,2.379371237458193,990,30,181,14,13,298,106,230,0.032,0.836,0.132,0.9655,4,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,7,2,2,9,0,0,12,0,19,2,0,1,1,36,32,10,0,3,6,2,1,3,2,0,2,2,0,3,25,16,0,0,8,4,0,1,2,0,1,1,1,7,20,9,35,27,5,14,0,0,4,0,24,5,0,6,7,129,45,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05471749716774547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08577052083956647,0.0,0.0,0.08461872047207704,0.0,0.04538587910325792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08203996487483763,0.07635069520992417,0.0,0.09841834788525232,0.13869831448420514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07937539168943153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08915296659133168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14799096124359354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178674542592696,0.0,0.13155813117501325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15075333427831167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059916191551480924,0.09100360653257042,0.0901770299039054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598469281821735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19933802598391867,0.0,0.0,0.373374021155846,0.1567517566706825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17193252914527551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09547191549546682,0.3591413245202556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07138158216405349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6084339067606261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11926649366183666,0.11503050074358602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0529433873257192,0.14249627186087682,0.0,0.0,0.08070595529303423,0.0,0.16199075526100942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,kayno-way,2019/04/01,"EIBI Anyone have experience with EIBI? Can we have a discussion about it vs ABA, without me being called abusive for having my son on the waitlist for it lol. 

I know it's based in ABA but a LOT of the complaints I see about ABA on here are things I'm told EIBI, here at least, doesnt do. Like the worker I dealt with specifically said its NOT about ""training out the autism"" or stopping stimming (as long as its not harmful) or about trying to make them ""normal"" as much as it is about preparing them for school and try to teach them some social skills. She specifically went on about how problematic ABA is/was, but that EIBI is different.  I've talked to other moms who say the same thing, they dont want to ""train out the autism"" just teach them necessary skills.    
I see the issue saying that it's not letting autistic kids be themselves and trying to make them act like neurotypical kids, but even being their autistic selves they still need to learn life skills, social skills included?          

I've seen people speak out against ANY sort of intervention, I got tore a new one for saying my sons in Early Intervention, called me abusive and said he should be taken away from me...  he loves his worker &amp; her biweekly visits, I'm right there the entire time and they just play with her encouraging speech and trying to teach him some rules to some games. He gets more excited to see her than he does Nana!!     

Obviously if I see or hear anything I dont like I'll put a stop to it. I was undiagnosed growing up and had noo support and always felt like everyone else took some class on social skills that I missed, and was always lost AF socially. I want my son to have support he needs. If EIBI aint it what is?  Dont insult me direct me :p 

Honestly with the leaps hes made just since the start of our early intervention visits I'm not sure he even needs EIBI. One concern majorly for me is I'm not even sure if hed be in it this year coming up, hes supposed to start school the next year but starting school takes him off the EIBI waitlist.. not about to keep him home an extra year just to do EIBI.

autism,throwaway47463728273,2019/04/01,"Can you relate to these symptoms? I know that a professional diagnosis is always best, but I figured I could just vent here and get some feedback on my situation.

I’m 20 years old. Concerned that my parents have hidden a diagnosis from me. I’ve always felt different, and starting as early as middle school, really struggled with social situations. I have no problem looking people in the eye, but I’m always nervous and fidgety. I’ve also struggled making new friends over the years.

I’ve tried laying still in bed and the longest I can go without moving is like 2 minutes (with minor muscle spasms in legs). I read that fidgeting is a common symptom of Aspergers, but that could be wrong.

I have considered the possibility that it could be social anxiety, but the twitching/fidgeting makes me think otherwise. 

Also important to note that I had one seizure at the age of 2. Never had another since (and apparently doctors told my parents it was nothing to worry about).

autism,bearycurious101,2019/04/01,"managing your 5 senses. hypersensitive individual here,  stimulation affecting my sight, hearing and sense of touch tops the list in making me vulnerable to the environment.

concerning sight, i could only think clearly when i close my eyes in attempting to focus, everything in my peripheral view just catches my attention.

sound. this is the most painful thing to work with. crying children, children playing, high pitched sounds makes me irritable and infuriated

touch. i only wear clothes made of cotton. any other synthetic is a nono. i love clothes that are either black or white. coloured clothes does affect my mood. i dont wear watches, rings, necklaces , i kissed my sleep tracking device goodbye because i know it is always there.

autism,Herman-Toothrot,2019/04/02,"Another happy story My 4-year old son likes to me to hold him in a rocking chair for a little while before going to bed.  The other night I started running my fingers through his hair, like a super light scalp massage (he is not touch sensitive).  He almost immediately conked out and fell asleep in my arms.  Same thing the following night, dozed off within a minute of my fingers in his hair.

Last night he was more awake, and lasted longer.  My arm got tired after awhile so I stopped.  He looked up at me and said in a very soft voice “Keep doing that?”

He is fairly verbal and says medium length sentences.  But it was an especially adorable thing to hear since he was asking me to do something for him that he liked 🥰",4.631079136690648,5.928427395683457,4.7720071942446065,85.60707553956837,70.0071942446043,6.99884892086331,25.41079136690648,7.1686216300943375,1.0503030215827345,564,16,110,5,10,176,99,139,0.036000000000000004,0.826,0.138,0.9325,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,1,6,0,0,8,0,7,9,8,0,0,12,16,7,0,0,2,1,6,3,0,0,1,4,1,0,6,5,0,3,0,1,0,4,1,0,0,0,5,12,14,6,19,11,2,24,0,0,1,0,16,10,0,1,13,64,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17814665161655338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865494199905543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16631761933255432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1513844701409992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10110779080879456,0.0,0.14228727374758252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18938370413253208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005124190065304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15813057535225536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2900334410508786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2607469107817457,0.17830804020714408,0.0,0.0,0.1493958064470569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5008567571439391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866818866918328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16922886262470002,0.1414775876622164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14716526122002493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369603392435075,0.0,0.0,0.12592242275213272,0.0,0.0,0.1487369572036042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23638500717773225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204476191839064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14679066248384698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114565303841748

autism,oddrose,2019/04/02,"Nanny wondering how to deal with breakdowns Backstory: I have been nannying for an eight year old boy with autism since August. He struggles in small things but I have never had issues with his behavior. He is such a sweet boy who always has a smile on his face. He yells my name when I walk in the door and we have created a very strong bond over these months. 

So this month his Mom is taking on some extra work stuff and I am nannying from the time he gets out of school to a few hours after his bed time. He has rarely ever cried in the past or has asked to but never really did. But ever since I started watching him for the long evenings he has started having meltdowns for his mom. Bawling and screaming in some cases which is so different then how he usually is.

I understand this is a change of schedule and routine for him and of course any kid would miss their mom if they were gone for such long periods of time. So my question is, what can I do to help him through it? I try to give tight hugs and words of affirmation but I feel like there is more I can do to help. Any advice is helping, thank you so much❣️",3.0512421154779226,4.494295087336244,3.799614264919942,90.48089640950994,74.10917030567686,7.184958757884523,23.639252789907808,7.793537801064563,0.9546883066472596,881,25,191,12,18,280,139,229,0.029,0.8140000000000001,0.157,0.9862,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,1,1,2,2,13,8,0,1,10,0,26,2,1,2,4,33,38,20,0,2,6,3,2,1,0,1,0,2,2,3,9,11,0,1,4,0,0,2,2,3,0,1,5,6,24,5,30,32,5,35,0,1,1,1,34,9,0,6,25,133,33,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12155025605645378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350056088563388,0.0,0.0,0.16917585189958714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11628574209469288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13158573151346994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13663408725051054,0.0,0.12823829401822698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12995870958999084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821569265309618,0.2250316571752241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289417677910701,0.08886262348646692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06498745817055185,0.11932405075046855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2501234324758943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12249686400582517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12982847948561893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0607695647657679,0.0,0.0,0.2201584642972255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43704423931246705,0.198570208370425,0.0,0.09143929823155353,0.0,0.19187098060166388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13052400471287906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11874216882343215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13934273184437065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07968596884230254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12588702962476822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20578964129244556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17608455958973962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13003706919024696,0.14239419826973454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09352409726327024,0.0,0.0,0.11451951533352075,0.0,0.0,0.08263768472045906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2175944675676243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844511077510907,0.0,0.0,0.12949201999498872,0.0,0.0,0.13699551788978365,0.10263290917707717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13489319371837644,0.09055575329365986,0.0,0.0,0.08836147882993446,0.0,0.0,0.0801016238027283
autism,curi0us_kiwi,2019/04/02,"Looking for advice on how to soothe &amp; provide the best care to kids with autism I recently got a job as a school bus monitor for the special education program in a nearby school district. During their commute to school and back, I sit among the passengers and am responsible for kids with a vast array of challenges, whether it be emotional, mental, physical, or a combination. Many of the kids I've ridden with so far seem to be on the autism spectrum, and I feel they deserve to start/end their school day with an adult who is as knowledgeable as possible about what they need. I've been hearing many other monitors are impatient, grumpy, and inattentive with the kids, and I find that unacceptable. 

I know all autistic kids are all different, and I'm worried about taking the wrong approach and making the situation worse. We are not provided with any information about the child aside from whether or not they require a car seat or seat belt harness, so I'm thrown in without even knowing whether or not they are verbal.

I know some people with autism prefer not to be touched, and being touched can make things worse. However, I also know it can comfort others in some situations. 

The last two days I had a boy who seemed to be non-verbal, and would start hitting himself when we got about half way to school. The first day I was ineffective at getting him to stop because I was afraid making physical contact might make it worse. I tried talking to him with a calm voice, reassuring him that it was going to be okay, and I tried distracting him by talking about the Mario characters on his backpack. All that was a big fail and he kept hitting his legs the rest of the ride. 

I felt his behavior might have been triggered by anxiety regarding getting closer to school, and I didn't want to let him remain in emotional distress, nor did I want him to hurt himself physically. I wanted to ask the bus driver for guidance but it felt wrong to talk about the boy in front of him as if he weren't there, so I just tried my best.

Once the kids were off the bus, I asked about the boy and found out that he doesn't respond negatively to being touched. So today, when he started hitting himself, I went and sat next to him and spoke to him softly while holding my hands out to block him. I saw that he was actively avoiding hitting my hands, wanting only to hit himself. This made me think it was possibly a sensory related impulse, and I cupped my hand around his firmly but gently. He relaxed a lot, and when he would take his hand back every now and again to hit himself, he'd place it back in my hand instead. I wasn't entirely sure why it had worked, but it made me so happy that it did. It really felt good.

I know there are no blanket answers for dealing with autistic kids, but I'm willing to hear any suggestion anyone has for me that could make a difference. I honestly wish we were provided with more training. I have more experience than a lot of the monitors due to 7 years as a nanny, but I am responsible for kids with much different needs now and I need to adapt to that.

Thank you in advance!",7.9202499999999985,6.876219858333336,7.687666666666669,75.56800000000003,62.91666666666666,11.0,37.0,10.125756701596842,3.5582,2465,102,471,45,30,787,281,600,0.07200000000000001,0.8059999999999999,0.121,0.9895,4,1,0,0,0,0,58.0,3,1,6,9,29,24,0,4,35,1,46,6,6,9,4,110,104,49,0,13,19,0,13,0,0,5,0,4,0,13,26,36,0,6,19,1,0,8,12,9,0,3,30,19,66,15,82,53,13,54,0,2,2,0,67,21,0,13,23,331,92,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06624284389563298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05421101693122128,0.0,0.07344959451352033,0.0,0.09219799210534077,0.0,0.05185856984655631,0.0,0.0,0.04739980071565903,0.0,0.0,0.060346780385768,0.12674754477339625,0.0,0.0,0.1563771837173037,0.0,0.0413236809836685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14228121399962815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06911563049525203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05412417829625105,0.0,0.0,0.13115532180870645,0.06988771202708342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2124759286788168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15250750279841918,0.060041130437690785,0.0,0.0,0.04477414228241379,0.0,0.05711534388113981,0.0,0.0,0.06631086756880247,0.0,0.0,0.03427626785407762,0.0,0.19526485379177155,0.0,0.06195812147631617,0.057661478229966576,0.0,0.0743273837705294,0.0,0.0,0.07083414196620723,0.0,0.03852617748469805,0.05685838379392182,0.1084344681722858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07216288813902988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15280676159051831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07256976499003018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06727034351782614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862759198746654,0.05525726423770271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693190731089589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056925873947077425,0.0,0.0,0.11526394601093345,0.0,0.12828760325720112,0.2262491628445027,0.13745526383220644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06831559232356554,0.14382730536387284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04983287863964495,0.15079454911612825,0.0,0.0,0.07209460743278259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07219330981403002,0.0,0.05155675859086985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04699651158669582,0.0,0.07082530955960559,0.0,0.0,0.15284432623621175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04342751192758717,0.0,0.06693367930003796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4116378750224282,0.0,0.12342552478926068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15239585322700108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14394468228742674,0.0,0.0,0.056674825608607426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389054017714123,0.0,0.10193811805074947,0.16345922827768727,0.0,0.06241120852693732,0.0,0.0,0.045036147404670566,0.043436596721036114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06425625676892828,0.0,0.0,0.13807329731096238,0.0,0.06622022045475046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15993535971396575,0.05380792968005189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06284128862837579,0.06116922958105842,0.0,0.0779542606474136,0.06534639165443022,0.0,0.04935136151829488,0.06884324625661893,0.2072490280930237,0.09631103772911948,0.14823374666492314,0.0,0.04365403688566822
autism,Borneoboreon,2019/04/02,"Scored really high on an ASD diagnostic evaluation and was told that I don't have ASD?   

I created this account specifically to ask for other opinions on what is going on with me currently. Not really a throw away account just didn’t want it tied to my other one. 

I’m a 33-year-old male. I’ve been in and out of therapy for the past 7 years after the failure of my first marriage. I’m married and have two young kids. I’ve done personal and couples counseling throughout that time and never really felt like I’ve gotten much out of it. Looking back, I’m able to deal with my relationships better and it has improved a lot of aspects in my life, but I feel like I still struggle with a lot of the same core issues. I recently (past 4 months or so) have started with a new therapist and it’s going well. I’m doing twice a week therapy session which isn’t fun, but I kind of view it like working out. Don’t like it, but it overall is a better when I’m doing it rather than not. 

I have recently come to realize how emotionally unavailable my parents were growing up and that I have a significant number of traumatic events from early childhood that I have never really dealt with. I did a lot of public speaking and 4-H stuff growing up. Reached the top leadership positions in the State, but a lot of that was driven by my mother’s desires rather than my own. I was in leadership organization in college and did that sort of stuff, but I’ve always struggled with fitting in. Make friends (I don’t have many close friends) became especially difficult after college. I’ve struggled in all my jobs and have had bad interpersonal interactions in almost all my jobs. I finally quit the 9-5 and have been a stay at home dad and consultant for the past 4 years. Last year I started looking for jobs and being very intentional in trying to go back to a corporate setting. It’s been a struggle, especially since what I did if a very niche industry. Just a little back story there.

What brings me here today is…recently through some off the cuff comment from my wife (“are you autistic?”). I actually stopped to think about it, so I did some research. Read a bunch of articles and then ended up on YouTube listening to adult diagnosis stories of people with ASD. A lot of their experiences resonated, and I related to them quite strongly. I did more research and took a couple of online ASD evaluations ( Aspie-Quiz [http://www.rdos.net/eng/quizh8.php](http://www.rdos.net/eng/quizh8.php), etc.) . All things pointed that I should get this check out and that I might be on the spectrum.

I talked to my therapist who wasn’t really keen on the idea, but I kept insisting that I wanted to confirm or rule it out. Finally he presented me with two options one was a traditional diagnostician and the other was a therapeutic diagnostic approach. I chose the therapeutic approach since it seemed like I would have more chance to explain myself and could then loop my therapist in after the testing to target treatment. I went in and did a ASD exam very similar in length and content to the Aspie-Quiz followed by close to 4 hours of personality interview, and at the end took a another test focused on social anxiety disorder related content. 

I had the consult with the diagnostician and my therapist today to go over the results. The social anxiety testing showed I had significant social impairments, but an average (within norms) level of anxiety. My aggression and something else closely related to it was abnormally low (like almost non-existent) which the diagnostician dismissed based on his time talking with me. We went over the personality testing which wasn’t a huge surprise basically most of what I knew or have come to realize about myself in therapy over the last 7 years. We then came to the autism evaluation. It was based on my answers about how I view myself. I scored 153 out of 160+ (I’m not sure what the end of the scale was but it was between 160-170). The diagnostician then quickly told me that he strongly not advised me to self-identify as someone on the spectrum or report myself as on the spectrum to anyone. He viewed it like my low scores on the social anxiety questionnaire as an outlier and not to be paid attention to really. He suggested instead that I “might have an avoidance personality”. He didn’t say that I had Avoidance Personality Disorder in our meeting, but I came home and studied it like crazy. I have very low view of myself and struggle with my identity, but I just don’t relate to what I’m seeing the way I did with information about late in life autism diagnosis. He still has to finish his summary, and this consultation what just one of the closing steps in the evaluation to go over the data. I was hoping for a yes or no on social anxiety and autism, and maybe some guides for what it could be, but this result is confusing and really open ended to me I’m not sure where to go from here. 

Thus I come for your opinions. How do I score so high on the autism evaluation and just have it ignored because I have developed low level competency with general social skills. Maybe it isn’t autism, but I don’t understand the results. It might be AVPD but I just don’t feel like it’s a fit. Yeah similar but….?

I meet again with my therapist in a couple days to unpack and await the summary. Do you think I should seek further testing for ASD? Is there a overlap or comorbidity with ASD and AVPD? AVPD doesn’t seem really solid or the research for it a priority which is may be why I’m struggling to see this, but I just don’t understand diving into the ASD result and comparing them or testing them further to differentiate ASD from the AVPD idea. 

Any thoughts, kind words, resources, or similar experiences would really help right now. If you made it this far I’m sorry It was so long. I hope it all made sense. I'm just kinda lost here at the moment.

autism,thank-you-lovely,2019/04/02,"Is this stimming? Hi everyone. I'm 19 and I've had a suspicion for about a year now that I might be on the spectrum. Right now what I'm most curious about is whether or not what I do is stimming. Whenever I get very anxious, I either make a repetitive grasping motion or I ball my fist and bounce my forearm up and down. If I am around people, I can suppress the urge. Sometimes it is uncomfortable to stop it. For as long as I can remember, if I get happy enough I get this feeling in my chest like I need to do something but I've never been able to figure out what it was I wanted to do so badly. It mostly happened when I was listening to music, but now it's happening more often. I've been listening to a very funny and exciting podcast, and it gives me that urge more than anything else has before. I noticed I would start to wave my hands and stop myself, so the next time I started to do it I just didn't stop. It feels really good! I've been doing it a lot and I don't know why I've never done it before. Also, when I'm lost in thought I'll trace patterns over and over again either with my finger on my leg or my foot on the ground. I'm really curious. Are any of those things stimming? I have two anxiety disorders and a mood disorder. I'm not diagnosed, but I suspect I might also have ADHD because it runs in my family. I'm not sure if my repetitive behaviors can be explained by any of those. All I know for certain is that I love waving my hands around when I get happy because it feels SO good.",2.7066587802313364,3.8462920883280765,4.674183753943218,85.07649119348055,74.48895899053628,7.933175604626709,26.45754468980021,8.472884824447931,1.754852891692955,1180,42,250,21,24,406,157,317,0.102,0.76,0.138,0.9495,0,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,1,18,12,0,0,10,0,32,9,7,1,5,59,61,29,0,6,16,0,6,1,0,3,1,2,0,0,23,13,0,4,11,1,0,2,7,2,0,1,10,8,36,9,33,46,9,37,0,1,0,1,6,15,0,12,21,182,59,0,0.10915811032094852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13118683597008915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17458740277184698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14846251641869054,0.0,0.08350565561663888,0.1233175940418672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982782392036845,0.19434772209791346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09114246258067786,0.13308354176540102,0.0,0.1857710240168146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11079318421559173,0.0,0.0,0.25020930288595844,0.0,0.0,0.11170664574474608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911875943103692,0.0,0.0,0.1127895077637211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430525227971572,0.0,0.0,0.1029045515875563,0.0,0.16558086123751894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22812242923135684,0.10471440601464074,0.0,0.1831132879314916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19305631291323871,0.23240167644692666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11998088540237188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053329138913687436,0.0,0.0,0.0966014926286306,0.0,0.0,0.11915897209899988,0.0928023218639053,0.09851945638182408,0.0,0.07286388626585116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23159900987478316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809393556655897,0.1683789281271194,0.0,0.11609088869809042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242772320954837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567648940867594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13985896124952188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123654859891757,0.09322042978430824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403524630782437,0.10796016227307167,0.0,0.15452534463775566,0.0,0.0,0.2737832040148161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028802271443217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07251979810863105,0.0,0.0,0.08665934651558954,0.06365097195441498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663161248978223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18013374595380985,0.0643842816564125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849821610670936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07754278967281462,0.0,0.0,0.07029424415746267
autism,PWcrash,2019/04/02,"Experiences with horrible teachers? I went to school in a small town and when I went to kindergarten kids that were labeled as ""special needs were singled out and humiliated by this one teacher. And I say special needs very loosely as it could be anything from being too hyper to lower functioning autism and we were just lumped into one group. Ironic thing is most of those kids grew up to be neurotypical adults. 

At the end of everyday before the she would wall us to the bus she would put stickers on the shirts of me and all the other ""special needs"" kids and how many stickers determined how good you were that day. 1 sticker meant you were terrible and 5 stickers meant you were perfect. But you would lose a sticker for the stupidest reasons. I would lose mine mostly because i would get dirt stains on my dresses on the playground and I ""needed to learn to act like a lady"". 

And this was done in front of the entire class before heading on the bus. As you can expect, the bus ride home was filled with ridicule and bullying from the other kids that didn't need to have their behavior monitored like crazy. 

The next year when I was in first grade I went up to my new teacher before class ended and timidly told her I needed stickers before I could go home. When she asked me why and i explained she looked absolutely horrified before gently telling me I didn't have to dothat anymore.

To this day i still cant believe that was allowed in the year 2000 and that parents at the time were Ok with it. When I asked my grandparents years later they said that they thought it was all children that got it and they didn't know what was really going on.",6.4745531281032775,6.819841122641512,6.039884144323072,81.56974677259187,65.44654088050315,8.707315458457463,31.831181727904678,8.371475516178862,2.2839660377358486,1319,48,250,16,19,407,168,318,0.115,0.804,0.08199999999999999,-0.8787,4,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,2,5,4,4,9,13,1,1,17,1,32,3,2,4,3,51,55,24,0,14,2,1,0,2,0,5,1,2,2,6,19,20,0,0,7,0,0,11,4,5,0,3,26,3,37,8,40,19,5,47,0,2,1,0,31,18,0,2,20,177,56,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09384514383184568,0.0,0.0,0.07787044522375226,0.0,0.1769280490162354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05768410163432521,0.0,0.4026055546744005,0.1066128915421151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15110486420361094,0.0,0.0,0.12205393667755203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09683688036689636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16762391868121848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09256394235089536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08049018120910739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049439011083907865,0.0,0.10755808217993293,0.07936913439120473,0.07568232952415528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711520920492923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898383799916688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052004849705059926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09246052301766902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07946334450901786,0.21172814075402796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593752565512728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4209909616016391,0.0,0.09139191778204156,0.10063751736160606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12824421031353495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10507274222714512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09512686603334077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06062085835835481,0.0972929245307147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900125092626434,0.07525165903965003,0.0,0.0957681747854442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556971701364533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08270868607671944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06286636723229401,0.0,0.0,0.07512373785154366,0.055178109729216884,0.0,0.0,0.0904207191014402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11382534169720372,0.0,0.0,0.07807767340373485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2631621767797359,0.08538668318153067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336103630934372,0.0,0.0,0.18281119981470145

autism,SithPsyche,2019/04/02,"Just donated to the Autism Self Advocacy Network In honor of Autism awareness and in honor of my son. Thanks to this sub I found the group! The puzzle piece always kind of left a bad taste in my mouth but now I know where I can donate and make a difference not only for my son's future but for everyone like him. 

He's so great. I can't imagine him any other way. I'm so blessed to have a wonderful, brilliant, boy. I never want him to think something is missing from who he is. He's perfectly whole and wonderful.

autism,TGayderz,2019/04/02,"Institutional abuse is still a thing I came across a video on YouTube explaining this place called Judge Rotenberg Educational Center. It’s in Massachusetts, and is the only school in the country to still shock their autistic and mentally ill students for misbehaving.

autism,jmts1121,2019/04/02,"Advice please! Hi everyone, I’m a mom of a 3 year old with autism. I really need advice on how to give him medicine. He has very distinct tastes and seems to notice any time I try to mask or hide medicine and won’t take it. I can be straight with him and say he has to take it to feel better but he will vomit within minutes of taking it. I’m at a total loss. Last night he suffered through a night of 101-102 temperature because every time I tried to give anything for fever, he vomited it right up. I’m so worried he will need an antibiotic and I won’t be able to give it. If anyone out there has tips, especially any adults with autism who may have personal experience, I’d be so very grateful.

autism,rooshi000,2019/04/02,"Does early education of social behaviors make diagnosis more difficult? Happy autism awareness month! Speaking of,

To the extent that autistic people are able to focus on and become expert at whatever topics interest them, what are the diagnostic consequences of those whose early education and interests centered heavily around social behaviors?

Full disclosure, I'm drawing upon personal experience here and haven't obtained an official diagnosis (not looking for one, as per rules). But I think my situation is interesting enough that it warrants further discussion as a potentially common occurrence... 

I've always been super weird compared to everybody else, and the characteristics of high functioning autism fit much more than the narcissistic personality disorder I was given by a grad-student in training.

I grew up Mormon (I'm not anymore) which is a culture that explicitly grooms ""proper"" behavior down to the instruction to look people in the eye, firm handshakes, sales/small talk, frequent public speaking practice, etc. 

I also majored in social-cognitive neuro psychology and finished 3 more years of related PhD training which brought me an acute awareness of the multitude of thought processes and behaviors I could then observe in myself and consciously adjust to suit the situation. 

(Notably, I dropped out because I wasn't playing my cards right. I didn't even realize I was in a political arena; in fact I thought academia would be the opposite of BYU's cookie-cutter social scripts which I couldn't bear to follow... But apparently all humans do this). 
 
But anyway, between my education and a fascination with social behaviors, I can do all of these things REALLY well if I'm consciously choosing to (or drinking), but it's exhausting within minutes and I would rather prefer to practice quiet mindfulness in social situations. Conversely, I find that with people I'm comfortable around (eg Friends, S.O., etc.), I tend to revert to my more comfortable state of consistent routine, avoiding eye contact, and even a style of humor that is more conceptual than it is interactive... (That is, if *they* initiate hanging out, because God knows I won't.)

And although my iq is barely a standard deviation above average, my verbal expression *achievement* scores (which measure acquired knowledge, not aptitude) are literally off the charts (99.9 percentile). I think I developed linguistic communication  skills as a coping mechanism for my apparent lack of emotional expression and desperate desire for others to understand me. Plus, language as a system of symbols for representing abstract concepts is just fascinating to me. 

So extrapolating from my experience, it occurs to me that undiagnosed autistic people could easily fly under the radar, getting by just well enough through consciously practicing skills in situations that offer immediate feedback (e.g. behaviors and their consequences in social interactions) but struggle in more long-term contexts, such as maintaining relationships or jobs.

I know a lot of people aren't diagnosed until their adulthood. From your experience what obstacles may get in the way of a diagnosis? And beyond situations for which coping skills have already been developed, what benefit does a diagnosis even offer?

autism,BonelessAngelBoy,2019/04/02,"Poem: Alone I am. Alone I am, sitting at the lunch table 
Hearing laughter from far away 
Wondering whether today or not 
I would be cherished and embraced 

Alone I am, in the classroom 
always chosen as last partner 
the dirty looks focus on someone 
And that someone is me. 

Alone I am, on the playground 
wanting to make friends 
The heartless one comes up to me 
And says I would be better off dead

Alone I am, in the hallways 
Friendless and in Pain 
the others stare and smile 
but none have ever say hello 

Alone I am, in this world. 
different and frowned upon 
Never understanding their rules 
And they never understand me. 

Alone I am, on the spectrum 
Thinking in my domain 
Where It is safe and free 
For that is how the world should be 



This poem was written by me, BonelessAngelBoy, in reflection on Autism Acceptance Month.  I am on the spectrum and I wrote this to express my feelings about my middle school years.  If you know someone who is on the spectrum; love them with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.  We are all people.  And it is better to be united rather than divided.

autism,Olive09,2019/04/02,"I think I'm autistic, now what? As the title says, I am pretty positive I'm autistic. I've thought this for maybe a year. Didn't put deep thought into it until now. How do I find out for sure? I need to hear it from a professional. I have a new therapist I go to on Thursday. Maybe she can help? My 6 year old son has autism. I figured it out and no one would listen until I kept insisting. He is now diagnosed and that would mean I passed it down to him and possibly my 1 year old baby.  I don't know how to feel right now. Please help, where do I start? Who do I go to? Im scared and nervous. This would explain everything. This would explain why I'm so different from everyone else and I catch myself saying ""thats not how my brain works"" but yet I'm just like my son. Or rather he is just like me??

autism,throwawaypupper9,2019/04/02,"Wanting friends but also wanting to be alone. Is anyone else like that? 

Basically, when i don't talk to my friends after awhile i feel lonely and talk to them.

But when i do i feel uncomfortable and drained because after awhile i just don't enjoy doing things with them and wanna do stuff on my own, i enjoy myself more when i don't have to put myself out there.

And after awhile they start treating me worse because i don't come around as often and then it just makes me flat out dislike having friends because of how much hoops i have to jump through.

Is anyone else this way?

autism,Supersonic97,2019/04/02,"Stereotypes I'm a 22 year old, who has Asperger's and the biggest problem I have with others talking about autism are the stereotypes which even people trying to be nice about it say and the thing is I don't often dwell on the fact I have autism even though it's a day to day nuisance and it's a challenge for me to overcome to get work, but the stereotypes do pee me off as all autistics are different here's a list of stereotypes I see online and in public 
 
WE CANT UNDERSTAND OR BE HUMOUROUS - I've always been a humourous person whether its on some Facebook page or with my friends I'm always cracking jokes that people enjoy, like when my brother can't get over something I joke about the fact he must have autism 😂

WE HATE CROWDS AND LOUD MUSIC - I love going to see rock bands as its an enjoying experience, and as much as my anxiety and confidence plays up I love being in crowds and wouldnt get rid of them whatever.

WERE ALL EINSTEIN - it's great that theres successful autistics but it doesn't mean we're all some super computer and doesn't mean we all care about programming and stuff, plus some autistics can't even dress themselves or clean themselves so how in the world are they going to be the next Einstein
 (no offence)

WE CANT BE SOCIAL - I wish I had more friends although the few I have are great and wish i wasnt so awkward socially plus I wish I went out more, but it doesn't mean I can't go in a nightclub or do some activity it's a challenge with my anxiety sure but aslong as I have friends with me i feel more confident and willing.

WE ARE ZOMBIES WHO CANT FEEL FOR OTHERS - I'm one of the most emotional person you can know, like when I was younger my dad caught a spider crab that was dieing and I felt hopeless and cried a river of tears.

So yes what really annoys me are the people who stereotype about autism whether it's them trying to be nice or whether it's them being douchebags, my life is a challenge but with my patient and hope, I hope I'll get a job sooner than later 🙂

autism,RelativeStranger,2019/04/02,"In my son's nursery there is a coffee evening for parents of autistic children I went because my son is autistic.  It was interesting. 

I'm also autistic.  The parents all have children around three year old except one who had a child who is seven and was telling everyone about her experiences,  how to get help if needed and how to try to work out why children are reacting to things the way they are. 

I found most of the confusion the other parents were having I could answer easily,  not because my son is autistic but because I react the same way internally.  I very likely know what is causing their child distress in some circumstances.  

My question for the group, should I provide these answers as though I worked them out from watching my son or let people know I'm autistic? I want them to have the tools necessary to help their children,  they all seem like caring parents who are just struggling.  I cannot work pout whether they are more likely to listen to me if they know I'm autistic or more likely to ignore me.

autism,impractical_toker,2019/04/03,"Should I get diagnosed for autism at the age of 21? I took the autism-quotient test online and got a score of 28. The score reveals that I might have borderline Asperger's, so I've been thinking about getting checked by a professional ever since. Should I, though? On one hand I'll probably get answers and reasoning for my ""abnormal"" social behaviour over the years and get people on a sympathetic side, but I'm also afraid that I might give up on improving/ learning how to cope with this if I have a definitive reason. That autism will become my excuse for everything. I already have anxiety, and am socially awkward and have been trying to get out of my comfort zones lately. Getting diagnosed will just make me give up on that. What should I do? I've been pondering over this a whole lot lately. And I know this has probably been asked a lot.

 I just came across these posters from  the American National Autism Association on behaviour in children which  might indicate a need for autism screening. They might be useful  somewhere?

autism,kiranode,2019/04/03,"first group therapy session, still stressed out 10 hours later.. any help? Not sure if this is the right place.. so please tell me and i will remove/re-direct to proper.. but anyways, here it goes..

i am a female, 36, diagnosed about 18 months ago.. (suspected for much longer) mis-diagnosed with many other disorders along the way (anti-social, avoidance, borderline and one more i can't find the correct translation for)..

i have had issues all my life(obviously), but they where always discarded as being ""difficult"" child.. 

anyway, to get to my point, I had my first group therapy tonight.. i was nervous as hell (pit in my stomach, uneasy feeling, lots of movements.. ) 

then I got to my group, got a shock, cause i thought i saw someone i knew from way back when, that was gonna be there too.. soo que more anxiety and stuff.. 

turns out he wasn't\*phew\*.. but then in group they asked me to go first.. and i couldn't utter more than 3 setences before breaking down completely.. Like crying and stuff.. i spend the next 40 minutes moving my foot/leg(thing i do when i am stressed) and turning a pencil in my fingers to calm down.. 

i managed to calm down enough to talk and interact, but, it's about 10 hours later, i am still awake, and i smoked an entire pack(35) of smokes in the span of 13 hours.. which i normally NEVER do.. i am just wondering if anyone else here has had similair things.. and if so.. does it get better..?

autism,Jorblades,2019/04/04,"Just started thinking about things, now I'm not sure what to do I was talking to my wife last night about how I have a hard time reading people's emotions and how I don't know how to properly convey my own emotions (for instance, when talking to my kids or my wife and I'm trying to get a point across, they often ask me why I'm angry, but I'm not angry, I just want to make sure I am heard. I'm told it's my tone of voice, but I'm not sure how/if I can control it). Coupling that with my inability to make friends or make (in my opinion) pointless small talk, and my extreme irritation with certain sounds, I started to think, ""hmm, that kinda sounds like ASD"" so I decided to try an online test ([This one](https://autismcanada.org/about-autism/diagnosis/screening-tools/adult/)), expecting to see maybe a few indications, but nothing major. I'm 32 now so surely *somebody* would have noticed something and mentioned it to me if I was on the spectrum, I thought. Now I know online tests are far from conclusive, but I scored way higher than I expected. I scored a 40/50, with the test saying that 30-50 is considered high risk. At first I thought ""No way, that can't be right."" but the more I thought about it, the more it makes sense. I talked to my wife about it and she said that it would explain a lot about me.

Here's the rub, though. Being 32 years old, I'm not sure what to do with this information. I could go through the process of getting an official diagnosis, but I'm not sure what advantage that would give me. I feel I'm functioning in life ok as is; I have a steady career that I enjoy and I am succeeding at, a loving family that for the most part understands me, and I am generally pretty happy with where I am in life. I was also diagnosed a few years ago with bipolar disorder, and ADD. I am currently taking Latuda for my bipolar. I kind of feel like I am dealing with enough as it is and I'm not sure if another diagnosis would be beneficial to me. I'm also not sure what kind of supports I could get as an adult, or even what kind of supports would be of use to me.

Does anyone know of anything that I can do to help myself, or strategies I can try?

autism,FearfulGamer,2019/04/04,"I am barely coping with paranoia. It is very painful, and maddening Advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I am diagnosed with high functioning autism. Constantly all day I worry about someone breaking into my house, and raping me day or night. I worry about suddenly dying any second, and other shit like that. My mom is usually the person that helps me calm down, but for financial reasons my mom needs about 3 or 4 jobs,(I would work if I could) and one of them might require her to work a job that requires her to go in at 5 pm leave at 11 pm. I can cope without her, but barely. She then expects me to go to bed right when she gets home while I have been freaking out all day, and she won't have enough energy to help me calm down even if I am having a panic attack. I am not trying to make my mom look bad she is amazing, but pragmatically this will lead to disaster mainly because she won't let me sleep by myself because I could have a psychotic break again, so then the pressure is on me to go to sleep within an hour while I have been freaking out for the past 3 hours or so. I also have insomnia, and pressure to sleep quickly just makes it 5 times worse. I won't be able to sleep, and then she will say we will be homeless because of that. She has a ridiculous plan, and after having an argument with me I think she realizes this now, and she has told me she is trying to find another job.

The problem is still there that I have to cope without here while she works. My paranoia is, so painful that it makes me feel suicidal sometimes. I don't feel truly suicidal anymore, but still. I already tried to kill myself once because of my paranoia.

Constantly reasoning myself out of my paranoia is exhausting, and very painful. It is maddening. Does anybody know how to decrease the pain?",6.396916666666666,6.058529302777783,6.7372222222222256,78.82000000000002,65.69444444444444,9.644444444444446,33.55555555555556,9.120678840339163,2.800405555555556,1439,56,279,22,20,467,179,360,0.292,0.655,0.054000000000000006,-0.9987,3,0,0,0,0,1,38.0,1,0,1,7,18,23,5,3,12,0,43,13,5,7,2,58,57,33,4,10,15,3,2,1,0,9,7,1,2,1,14,18,0,2,8,0,0,4,7,18,0,2,3,4,52,5,42,39,4,44,0,0,1,1,24,13,1,7,26,212,66,8,0.08012883087488669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830096615470103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08842415740004066,0.06407899710089765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449035272961463,0.08402206573378694,0.0,0.0,0.07946626896873835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09115811289379576,0.0,0.0,0.06690422679702876,0.19538316628964655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17318159977414166,0.0,0.12795270262257394,0.0,0.0,0.15502940106454974,0.0,0.0,0.08132907663937079,0.08316107573724356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012127987727577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827945020804057,0.0,0.05292433707986036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08103108898464821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07323629976347848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04186400693659623,0.0,0.13661718346749074,0.0,0.0,0.08834231891918548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10741733258434533,0.08466050919741007,0.0803757506730373,0.0,0.15782151537586758,0.09245791252685047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590310011237806,0.0,0.0886506792890791,0.0,0.044036709898874135,0.0,0.0,0.08484486220668161,0.0,0.0819371584639599,0.0,0.03914689930188476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06728803697316403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16045985045866726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08500402690411127,0.0,0.28153775484124577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05941451278499911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519547970021424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853345897596173,0.05429736955126571,0.0,0.3410509022140637,0.0940139183105977,0.0,0.0,0.0764920358362807,0.0,0.06996540440686445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07667246951228081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16477156715464064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06842958375065958,0.0,0.06372166244748574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08225109341083077,0.0,0.0,0.32074679583300025,0.0,0.067892898372407,0.0,0.0792494626241631,0.08969766592042834,0.0,0.0,0.12798197568662992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17529587108322084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05134331936424402,0.0,0.0,0.04672376566213495,0.0,0.0,0.07656653174656299,0.0,0.16320664910834787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825058669273067,0.1322293544836368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15448266711878575,0.0,0.17500422962006185,0.16274943459891614,0.08165812425904588,0.11384244489009733,0.0876082977270836,0.0,0.0
autism,YoureMyAngelDust,2019/04/04,Why does it feel like many other people with autism are smarter than me? I struggle all the time to find the right words to speak in a conversation and it’s very hard for me. Idk if it’s because they’re considered high functioning or they have Asperger’s but many other people I know with autism know the exact right words to say. I wonder if this means I’m low functioning or different areas are affected? When my IQ was tested it said my score was 80 but I’m still able to do most all self care tasks. ,2.6749406688241635,4.5624443689320415,3.537411003236248,90.08490830636462,76.18446601941747,7.2962243797195265,21.153182308522112,8.167268648758528,0.8824916936353828,402,10,86,7,9,128,70,103,0.08900000000000001,0.8290000000000001,0.08199999999999999,0.4694,1,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,1,0,2,4,0,1,4,0,6,0,0,1,3,22,15,8,0,2,6,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,7,3,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,5,8,2,9,12,3,9,0,1,0,0,6,6,0,6,4,46,15,1,0.19338132384451376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178834601150608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19716514784910674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20204232430083505,0.0,0.0,0.1692292996700787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09777940779443592,0.13815165639393615,0.0,0.0,0.17674702659581448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17323168220167565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20431798601315787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21255463645283407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944763467624605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3921166199587331,0.0,0.21064895334437528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26813252194869824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3302931878912252,0.1839499228537044,0.15378459047915638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20173889566944053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544345750230682,0.0,0.0,0.2021641472691992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11276220506514745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15955984470232254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17449656622887708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20971379661438735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Tsvnami,2019/04/04,"17F and need help on how to get a diagnosis. I've been wondering how I would go about getting a diagnosis and how to even bring it up.Do I just go to the doctor and say I think I have autism randomly? isn't that a little awkward? or can i just go to get a general diagnosis and if it shows up then go from there. I also dont have a family doctor and am still struggling with trying to tell the parent i live with.I told my mother and she said i didnt fit many of the traits when i was younger so that kind of put me off of it for a while but i keep thinking about it and still relate to a lot of the traits mentioned.
I basically need a step by step on how i should go about checking to see if i have it so i can rest and just get it out of my head for good.",1.8357017543859653,2.272560479532167,4.1136988304093585,90.95019736842106,75.78362573099416,7.571345029239764,22.437134502923975,7.793537801064563,0.625436257309941,586,14,149,8,12,205,91,171,0.023,0.928,0.048,0.5745,1,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,18,4,0,2,12,0,13,3,1,4,0,32,32,22,0,6,7,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,8,10,0,1,3,1,1,9,3,2,0,0,5,3,18,2,25,25,2,21,0,0,1,0,9,7,0,6,5,107,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12152134267656735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3110724014588895,0.0,0.0,0.17809450158431106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10036730899650388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325316807412214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3175686613662707,0.0,0.43180824499899056,0.1274557743460744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559534986104992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10185473456951287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350679026360424,0.0,0.15824163481397555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523025699506416,0.1341823439244218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12918987942265528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15406230287142508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2253509478851074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16873218822341468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15276049643724351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14454755185253407,0.12084368246289225,0.0,0.0,0.12109143483941455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427088785323888,0.0,0.0,0.1588602599380184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328186291801468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19473803863660435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14520307999327306,0.0,0.1031700038530097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16479276218244682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10794712294610766,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,salasamder9798,2019/04/04,"What is it like? Hi everyone.
I'm a paraprofessional in a public school system and I work with autistic students at a high school. I have one student in particular who has an average IQ but whose social skills an expressive communication are extremely delayed. He even has trouble effectively answering simple wh questions. A present we are trying to help him navigate his transition beyond high school but it is hard to ascertain how much he truly understands about the process. I was wondering if this fantastic community could provide me, a neurotypical individual, with some insights about how my friend and student sees  the world. 
Thank you so much for any response you provide.

autism,CazzaMcSpazza,2019/04/04,Friendships and autism I don't know if this is common but I have a lot of trouble maintaining friendships.  My main issue is dealing with ambiguity.  I can't bear it.  I get really worked up and upset if I cannot get to a place of understanding when dealing with people.  As people often don't say what they actually mean it's a regular occurrence.  My husband (we're separated but he's still very supportive) helps me deal with it.  When trying to conduct friendships this can impact by making me seem very intense.  People find it burdensome.  People don't want to be forced to tell you what they really think/feel.  People back off or I withdraw.  It leads to an intense feeling of social isolation and loneliness.  It's getting easier as I get older as I find a greater sense of what I can change and what I just have to accept about myself.  Anyone else find this when dealing with friendship/social interaction?,3.880348837209304,6.333702093023256,5.1362209302325565,77.38537790697677,74.58139534883722,7.788372093023256,27.02906976744186,8.660442795831766,2.363853488372093,728,28,124,15,16,241,100,172,0.128,0.716,0.156,0.4702,0,1,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,2,2,8,4,0,1,5,0,12,0,0,2,0,29,24,15,0,3,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,13,8,0,0,9,0,0,1,5,2,0,0,0,2,18,2,21,23,3,11,0,0,0,0,14,3,0,7,7,88,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.12150436368902523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706069145928662,0.12757580158957538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09574094923980504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13171568247431245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5134597565154162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10401261143683198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12591257916550191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34140123898018154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2602065529978477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08345681615691881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12995669502585894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06842775767681858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058544412479206,0.0,0.0,0.08311177794812917,0.0,0.0,0.13562852144627668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4315997887265828,0.0,0.1300870537424063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15952932964644806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099015809462915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11334975432004782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12692285473108805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09943430877778972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412931288948043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882773358106937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07978135114653104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08453450967066238,0.0,0.0,0.1296199032557818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20546853402869167,0.07343956512082774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09064518401699877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,sudo-apt-get-pizza,2019/04/04,"I need to buy a gift for a seven year old with autism. He like math and technology, what would you recommend? I tried searching for gifts that might particularly appeal to a child with autism, but they are mostly therapy focused, and I would rather buy something more  fun for him. I don't know if he has any particular interests (trains, flags, etc. - not to be stereotypical, that's just what my autistic cousin loved growing up) yet, but I will ask his mom to find out. She's only mentioned he really likes math and technology, and if he were a bit older I might get something like a raspberry pi, but I don't know if he would quite be old enough to enjoy it properly yet. He may enjoy something more technical like the raspberry pi, but I would rather not take the risk. 

Any ideas or recommendations?",5.706470588235291,6.5918292222222234,6.110333333333332,78.50550000000001,67.23529411764707,9.780130718954249,29.02549019607843,9.888512548439397,2.5837482352941183,633,21,124,14,10,204,93,153,0.0,0.7290000000000001,0.271,0.9925,0,0,3,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,1,1,5,10,0,1,7,0,15,1,0,0,0,33,22,12,0,10,13,2,0,4,0,8,0,0,0,1,5,7,0,0,4,0,2,1,4,1,0,1,1,0,14,9,12,11,6,9,0,0,0,1,17,2,0,8,10,78,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20608108527048336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14165314767607398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16542340100145228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15656331798606773,0.16898771726455533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384888827141827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916428827387598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17105053665352624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665456821821825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2961050934332535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13675503407315495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3214830009210056,0.0,0.17746140113461004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11235206474351833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.317994893988123,0.0,0.0,0.11523974135245085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16116290307683087,0.0,0.0,0.09706923745593804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3499484282870862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392611443385325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17327926261269172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287387793364954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4305491415922859,0.0,0.0,0.09757556636979177
autism,remcovana,2019/04/04,"Nicotine as treatment against sensory overload? I was diagnosed with autism when I was 12 years old, I am 19 now. But for the past years my autism has been frustating me more and more. I can do very little compared to the average human, because I get sensory overloaded very fast by everything.

At the moment I am going to a school specialized in autism, and I love it there. The downside is that it takes 1.5 hours in public traffic. This makes me so tired that even going 2.5 days makes me exhausted to the point I lie in bed all afternoon a few days a month.

But recently when looking up treatments, I read that some small studies have reported that nicotine fixes the sensory gating (the filtering place of all sensory inputs). This ofcourse would be amazing if that is true, because then I can go to school all 4 days. But I don't want to start an addiction without knowing for sure. What do you guys think? (BTW I would never smoke, it would be vaping).",5.160494505494505,6.542122192307692,5.560109890109892,80.13489010989012,68.83516483516482,9.336263736263737,32.13186813186813,9.661875296680813,3.1275032967032965,757,33,139,17,13,242,117,182,0.079,0.861,0.06,-0.1243,0,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,0,6,6,0,0,11,0,19,5,0,2,6,23,32,11,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,2,2,11,3,0,0,2,1,0,3,3,1,0,0,3,1,17,5,18,24,7,31,0,0,1,1,5,9,0,2,19,97,28,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16506047135317234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18459762841160032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2929429419539833,0.0,0.0,0.15367910095465254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10000561763560736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13607855279156805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791060616229962,0.0,0.2581512885402314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499208149234499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14910945504650605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832115925312709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517537206854351,0.0,0.0,0.12714720803842725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13665444847074948,0.0,0.2021361984074511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120854912486483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11677759095690946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588805017269624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14453904781970764,0.0,0.0,0.1581923955587073,0.0,0.14313245004117486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15145209531376427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14950021592380355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3064722764475003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10716957097481912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14270318996143458,0.0,0.11384231988158898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701813282489602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17402481047471866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24986006427893184,0.08930620227788492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14595491782823916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3226743491525227,0.0,0.0,0.195007595835222

autism,tasshu,2019/04/04,"I've officially been diagnosed. Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

First time posting here. I don't know if this is the right place - if it's not, I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Few weeks ago I was diagnosed with Aspergers and not sure what level yet. I am based in the UK and I am 30 years old, I've gone through my entire life not feeling normal, my parents didn't want me labeled because they thought it would effect my life and people would look down at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work in an I.T company where I feel constantly under stress and not good enough, this morning for example my senior colleague gave me a bollocking in front of a new colleague which is his second week. My senior was saying he doesn't understand my thinking and how can I not read a specific thing properly.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm saying is, I don't know where to turn :( I feel lost, alone and sad. - I'm on the verge of crying at work.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a mystic tradition that Buddhism grew out of, *Raja Yoga*. It's basically all about getting control of yourself and meditating a lot. They are an interesting bunch of dudes.

They called AS people *habitually one-pointed*. Such people were considered the ideal initiates because they are so excellent at *concentration meditation* (A meditation technique where you focus as perfectly as you can for a length of time).

autism,crick2x9,2019/04/05,"Sensory issues on Toddler Hello, been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and I figured I could get some perspective from this wonderful community on how to better help my daughter with her sensory issues.

My youngest daughter will turn 3 in May. She's on the spectrum and has quite a bit of sensory issues. When she's playing in our backyard, she does not stim at all. Physical activity and sand regulate her very well. The issue is in the ""class setting"". That's when the sensory issues unravel. The main one is when she gets mad she bends her ankle to the side like a lot. She also kind of kicks her foot in when she walks. I am concerned this behaviors will damage her little legs, so I'm trying to figure out how to keep her regulated. She wears a weighted vest with pressure to daycare which helps quite a bit, but still needs a lot of regulation. I'm wondering of anyone experienced this themselves or with their children, and what worked to keep the regulation going with out having to physically intervene constantly. 

I am also suspecting along with her speech therapist that she may also have ADHD. Her mom is NT but I have ADHD, so we're wondering if she may also have it, and the ADHD is throwing her off even more. (She's extremely hyper, and I think she displays other ADHD behaviors, but she's still too young to get a diagnosis on that. She got an early diagnosis on ASD already).

She's getting more vocabulary very steadily but she still can't tell me exactly what her little body needs. Once she is regulated, she absolutely thrives. Starts to use language, participates in the classroom's activities, etc etc. Any tips, personal anecdotes or advice is appreciated. I know everyone is different but hopefully I can find similarities within you guy's experiences that can help me figure out better and more efficient ways to keep her regulated.",5.668407871198567,7.533462906976747,6.8583720930232595,69.45693202146693,68.18604651162791,10.292307692307693,32.707513416815736,10.475803106731721,3.9341322898032214,1496,67,247,43,26,504,185,344,0.023,0.8809999999999999,0.096,0.9745,1,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,1,1,1,5,18,10,1,1,18,0,24,5,4,3,2,53,46,28,0,5,9,3,2,1,0,5,0,1,1,3,13,16,1,3,10,1,0,3,2,3,1,1,2,4,44,7,39,38,12,38,0,1,0,0,43,21,0,13,13,184,57,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3925608269988948,0.07979782135657701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09011453449850773,0.2612159013856077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05553202784476241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570990103595909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14444438018202996,0.1783045134594637,0.09070654952333272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08824612926052304,0.0,0.06519936730917572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531797651480748,0.0,0.0,0.07146176656219264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18214637424373487,0.05393607516119272,0.0,0.0,0.07803023030563326,0.0,0.07987976441035274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07463633531413215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17065723251469433,0.0,0.046409617215700284,0.0,0.0653114646899839,0.0,0.0,0.08085686117556018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642061944528953,0.0,0.0,0.08110743000575209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261624018372181,0.0,0.21775115686411411,0.0,0.08503697861675158,0.04487854597731281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039895258392902484,0.16369080614459353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13884989278428253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956399414943221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12110064307094813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869659045550091,0.055335355467051435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07130291126892359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737122610638186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05779981336800946,0.0,0.19564285092969436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0713749889071602,0.0,0.0,0.09481428402662254,0.0,0.05232483362193666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055442206609228765,0.08882331469210886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0705285642598476,0.0,0.13475714190210214,0.0,0.0648184061502695,0.0,0.09944064637419646,0.07342271233645728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2656724055659184,0.05944991033816958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Happizouki,2019/04/05,"Relieved for explanation, frustrated with dismissers. I (an adult) was recently given an official diagnosis of being on the spectrum, which was a massive relief to me as it gave me a reason for all the enormous struggles I have dealt with my entire life. I work in an artistic field because it has always been easy for me and I love it, and it’s great because lots of people in that scene are different and wonderful and accepting, and so I feel as comfortable as I can be around people in that crowd. 

I am a reserved person and keep things to myself, and when things get too hard I tend to just leave, and have always tried to hide what I struggle with from most people, and for better or for worse I have done a pretty good job of it. My closest co-worker/collaborator though has seen me at my worst and knows a bit of what I deal with but tends to minimize it when I tell him that I NEED for something to happen. He thinks I exaggerate. I do not exaggerate; and I definitely do NOT want attention. 

I have not been announcing it or anything, but told this collaborator/co-worker about finally having an explanation, of being on the spectrum, which actually explained SO much but he keeps insisting that I have a “healthy expression of emotions” and continues to put me in stressful situations and then be angry when I don’t handle them well. 

I am tired. This is the first time I have reached out to anyone in this world and I am very happy to meet all of you. Thank you for reading my little venting.

autism,CNN7,2019/04/05,"How can I help my son? Hi there,

My son is 8 y/o and in 1st grade. He has Autism and ADHD and is an all around great kid. One major challenge for him is communication. He can talk but his mind races so fast I think it's a struggle for him to get out coherent thoughts especially when he's excited. He does a lot of stimming and echolalia.

He's been upbeat and happy for his entire life. When my wife was taking him to school the other day he mentioned wanting to play with friends but not having any. We tried to talk to him about it after school but we got back a scripted response that was unrelated. 

Today when my wife was dropping him off he said he didn't want to play outside because the other kids are mean to him. I don't think he's being sought out and harassed but I think when he tries to integrate with other kids he's being rejected.

I'm choking up just writing this. He's such a sweet, loving kid. It kills me that he feels rejected. I knew these days were coming but I was hoping it would be further down the road. Can anyone offer suggestions? I know there isn't a magic answer to have him fit in but I want him to feel good about himself no matter how others view him.

Thanks in advance.",1.7220295698924737,3.788406391129037,3.1424193548387116,90.93779569892472,79.84677419354837,5.584946236559142,21.623655913978496,6.6274283507984215,0.3822091397849468,947,28,200,9,24,309,145,248,0.11,0.711,0.179,0.9592,1,2,0,0,0,0,21.0,2,0,0,2,15,17,2,1,9,0,23,2,0,2,1,44,44,19,1,5,8,4,2,0,1,1,1,1,0,4,12,14,0,0,10,2,0,2,5,5,0,1,11,5,27,12,28,29,3,25,0,2,1,1,46,12,0,2,10,128,39,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18685948043769468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10573327909514632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10871682221445636,0.0,0.0,0.13841218940498584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195562725574574,0.0,0.09478055204700953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133934213053307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005464100168169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136063587119035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15723302048549684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1201252204071193,0.0,0.08123307168578085,0.0,0.0,0.13041115593304622,0.12435337934143482,0.17141975770544293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655137735146812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421649188209486,0.0,0.0,0.15442898209050482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17201810129139164,0.0,0.08544899243493262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109821729385124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13218547058223765,0.14032882412614267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16936577927571245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15699277530105438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10535881383230823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14789924914030778,0.0,0.0,0.3147127273382934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16254383323653046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11690332121310384,0.2499415270622548,0.0,0.1431471896330328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29888029223898377,0.0,0.1234355592558484,0.0,0.0,0.1473790171654924,0.0,0.0,0.2111245179611154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27512242359624745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11045014755333556,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,tissuesinmypocket,2019/04/05,"Sports fans made me cry with unexpected eruption of sound I was in the Student Union at my college waiting for group project members. Evidently there was a basketball game going on. It was playing on TVs nearby to my table. At some point, the winning point was scored and the students watching it started screaming. 
It was horrible for me. I kind of shut down and couldn't communicate well and then started crying. Sports are so universally accepted as a uniting pastime and not being into it certainly doesn't make me relatable at school.",5.851778350515463,8.248645969072168,6.048028350515463,73.29719716494847,68.69072164948453,8.561340206185568,36.86726804123711,9.188382445141503,3.8643618556701034,437,24,68,9,8,139,71,97,0.133,0.773,0.094,-0.6292,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,3,7,0,0,5,0,9,0,0,2,1,14,15,7,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,6,0,1,1,4,0,1,3,1,1,0,6,3,7,6,15,7,1,15,0,0,1,0,2,11,0,1,3,50,11,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5675062314911957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14680958435897887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26900121644712205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.244429254888832,0.17243104677052906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4883930415606444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2614342994987357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3656813861293116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23226129684555116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,tempthethrowaway,2019/04/06,"New. How do I Cope? So, I'm going to try my hardest to not say something socially unacceptable. I was raised to believe autism was a terrible thing. I knew there was something, different, about me growing up but didn't know what it was. I wasn't tested until adulthood as my parents would never allow it. Something about shame, I don't know, I don't understand them.

I like finally having an answer to why I am the way I am. It gives me a frame of reference to work from. My question is, how do I try not to get overwhelmed by all the stimuli in the world? I'm fairly high functioning, but pretty often something like trying to get groceries is just impossible due to the massive amount of people and noise. Sometimes my cat wanting to play and meowing to let me know is too much. How do I counter the overstimulus response I have? I welcome any help from you guys so that I can learn and be able to live life as best I can.

autism,FreedomDaisy,2019/04/06,"Scared to get a diagnosis. I (24F) have a 5 year old son, diagnosed asd. Through his diagnosis process and educating myself i've found a lot of traits/ signs that I have myself. Recently i've been exploring that further and i'm thinking about taking the next step to get an assessment done. However being a parent I am absolutely terrified of telling anyone about my worst days/ weeks. The days/ weeks that I struggle to get out of bed, to shower, to look after myself. I'm scared opening all of these secrets up to someone will lead to me being seen as an unfit parent to my son. (I'm not great, but he isn't neglected and he doesn't ever go without) 
My partner and I are also trying for another baby and I am worried how a diagnosis will effect that. Will I be treated differently? Judged harder? 
Does anyone have any experience with any of this? I'm so stuck. I desperately want answers to explain why I am like this so I can get help for the first time in my life but I can't jepordise my children to do that.",2.923034825870648,4.981233865671643,4.909278606965174,79.75456467661691,76.01492537313433,7.650746268656717,28.08208955223881,8.515128840125781,2.269728358208955,801,34,151,16,18,275,119,201,0.118,0.8170000000000001,0.064,-0.8303,5,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,3,7,8,0,3,10,0,20,2,0,3,2,27,37,12,0,1,4,4,0,1,1,3,2,0,2,2,8,8,0,1,7,0,0,4,5,5,0,1,5,2,21,3,27,26,3,21,0,1,2,0,13,5,0,1,13,103,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794071374080045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005846340821928,0.15464696469914732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2062446581538639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19022642924713384,0.0,0.0,0.14969037876208086,0.0,0.15408653135894673,0.0,0.0,0.1290618482078035,0.1509245377336078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13340524697990874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426497587674147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544748803402828,0.0,0.1617055939663432,0.0,0.0,0.3082114940330621,0.0,0.08381700118289369,0.0,0.0,0.1625986144951728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885358265815583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417037848209476,0.07205189614833803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384711786822215,0.0,0.0,0.12538329688924654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15684799767311136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15475677781610828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3275209814473841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14561995617901566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2953089476666215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12496039660803525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15417943901431078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11088755644957532,0.0,0.1289051254582773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09450003910182876,0.0,0.0,0.08599751119970171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10013009750435724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698827076509445,0.0,0.236601148504452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13307890174644596,0.0,0.0,0.14216667586013795,0.0,0.0,0.14977438276136038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497309881670486

It explains how (some) people with high-functioning autism perceive the world and why.

Most people with mild autism with whom I shared it found it very useful, to understand themselves and to help their friends understand too.

&amp;#x200B;

Being autism a very diverse condition, the book does not apply to all cases. That said, many people affected by autism and their friends or parents found it useful, so here it is.

autism,EPJ327,2019/04/06,"Help! I need your advice Hello people of r/autism. I need your input on something:

My brother is on the autism spectrum and has recently lost his spot in an education program for the third time. Obviously, this hit him very hard.

Here‘s where i need your help: as an allistic person, i experience and express love and support through physical contact, talking/writing messages (we don‘t live in the same city) and spending time with each other. I want to support my brother and show him that i love him but i‘m afraid i am only going to cause him discomfort this way.

Tell me: how do you express love and support? How do you want other people to show you love and support?
For those of you who were/are struggling with your education, do you have any tips that could help him cope?

PS: he loves cats. I was thinking about offering him to spend some time alone at my place with my cat. The flat is quiet and has blinds to shut the world out. Is this nice or insulting? I honestly have no idea.

Thanks in advance, i‘m grateful for any advice on how to be a better sister to my struggling brother.",3.756416799574694,5.845611406698566,4.238811802232856,85.35307150451891,73.68899521531101,6.749707602339183,27.879053694843172,7.594959193182576,1.6601098351940458,860,34,162,11,18,271,122,209,0.092,0.659,0.249,0.9913,0,1,1,0,0,0,29.0,1,9,0,3,6,19,1,4,8,0,15,6,0,4,1,31,36,14,0,6,2,4,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,9,14,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,0,1,2,3,32,13,26,31,3,19,0,1,1,5,40,12,0,2,4,110,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21506051105227508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139687211637275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496625607696424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09732183690130324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11304185560246645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08785834635221303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764067655469824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06253852440124502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09857463028719593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22127338501628327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12422227543584728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09716773460119224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1201221515922624,0.0,0.4965790181729876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447808011375993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369072188552433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15257638720090147,0.09608307768508928,0.1149688507736947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865167035668452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847145155607323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2300763442473201,0.0,0.0,0.4994904007410778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618020473349163,0.10131046322784837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050947800426059,0.0,0.0,0.1924964163609276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09079489675510236,0.12980941854491565,0.08734498834235373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Druid027,2019/04/07,"I really enjoy complex stories even when I can’t understand them Mulholland Drive is my favorite film. I failed English Comprehension because I can’t convey story themes, motives, and character arcs. It’s like there is some mental block and no matter how hard I try, I can’t gleam these details. To an extent, I feel I can understand them, just not well enough to use my own words to describe it. Since failing that class I have set off to read, watch, and listen to stories with more room for personal interpretations. 

I’ve always hated movie theatres, so my recent interest in film has really opened up a new world for me. The way the director uses pauses, sound engineering, and angles to give the impression that what we’re seeing is a dream is also very interesting to me. 

Does anyone else on the spectrum enjoy cinematography and literature despite not being able to comprehend it as well as NTs?

It was my autistic friend who brought it up and I told her I bought one but I feel like i’ve offended her. Is it a bad thing that I bought an autism toy when I’m not autistic?,2.2006666666666668,4.498545288888888,2.7322222222222234,93.285,79.44444444444444,5.777777777777778,25.555555555555557,6.937597516519254,0.9495555555555556,356,14,75,4,9,110,61,90,0.1,0.8220000000000001,0.079,-0.4215,2,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,2,1,0,3,5,1,0,4,1,5,2,0,1,0,11,13,9,0,1,4,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,9,5,2,0,1,2,4,1,2,2,0,1,6,1,11,3,5,7,0,3,0,0,0,0,9,1,0,2,2,46,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26865416796778024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2932232825469566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585972867395075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17756876536751398,0.2508853306917268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27132325018408204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17157036056417874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344174965767321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2379708083584694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4869323915052135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23331049709384774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3355705737407913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,alk1234,2019/04/07,"Parents of autistic children, what was the first clue that your child was autistic? My son (2.5 years old) is starting the process of being evaluated by different doctors and social workers. Next week, we’ll have our first meeting with an Early Intervention Coordinator. 

I don’t personally know anyone else that has a special needs child like this so I was just wanting to know- how did you know that your child was having issues? And at what age did you start approaching doctors and specialists about it?

My son doesn’t speak like other kids his age. He babbles a lot, says about 30 words, barely uses sentences or puts words together. He shakes and bites things constantly. He is very aggressive and just recently was kicked out of daycare for his behaviors. He has SO much more energy than any other 2.5 year old I’ve ever known. 

My concerns are justified, right? This isn’t normal behavior, is it?

autism,Random_Name10,2019/04/08,"Meltdown vs. tantrum? I’m hoping to get some advice on how to support my almost 3 year old son with ASD. He is great kid, playful, happy and loves being around his family. Language is developing and he now uses some  words to request and some short scripted phrases but sometimes our limited communication can make it hard to understand why he is upset.

I’ve read a lot of information from autistic adults on sensory overload and meltdowns, but based on the descriptions I don’t believe I’ve ever seen him have a true meltdown. He does get upset occasionally when transitioning from a preferred activity or when frustrated with a task (example-trying to open a locked door) but I think it’s more as a result of difficulty with emotional regulation. Can meltdown occur as a result of emotional dis regulation? Or would this be considered a tantrum? 

I recognize he’s not doing it on purpose but I want to make transitioning easier on him, especially when he’s at daycare and I’m not there to support him. We give countdown warnings, if-then explanations, sometimes it works fine but other times he has a hard time. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",6.430015797788316,8.09536558767773,7.456189573459718,66.65970300157979,66.1090047393365,10.366003159557662,35.867614533965245,10.504223727775694,4.2880367140600315,933,46,149,25,15,314,132,211,0.136,0.6920000000000001,0.171,0.7337,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,2,1,0,2,8,15,3,2,10,0,14,1,0,6,2,44,31,18,0,5,10,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,1,2,6,11,0,1,4,2,0,0,3,5,0,0,1,3,12,10,24,25,5,18,0,0,1,1,21,9,0,8,9,92,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2852058871231461,0.0,0.0,0.14612969736589987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923868218431836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12991031198830574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16441525497991505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12770597104827774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3283074447791506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13200373964173928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13757158825891555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15248676770209466,0.1399911561420678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16089041218266936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15534719917434872,0.2614525999341844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14494328375020488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12406606526116358,0.1317092186862164,0.0,0.1948213253090406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1531309590072469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14597137060222382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886607203173067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3312035346605949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13435446795126407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935072558248827,0.0,0.0,0.17018810481948482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09907816686743774,0.0,0.0,0.1519202329811876,0.0,0.12603828898640568,0.0,0.0,0.08607440341300814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13168082287342184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10624014621667152,0.0,0.0,0.20733164021883999,0.0,0.0,0.0939753457452657
autism,tigrekell,2019/04/08,"sense of 'safety' = ability to pursue your own day... Hullo lovely people and happy belated awareness day!!  I am a 32 yo adult recently self-diagnosed on the spectrum.  It makes sense for absolutely Everything, so not looking for diagnosis validation.  Just seeking shared reality about the endless mystery in my life:

I am a solo artist/freelancer.  Having an open schedule has 'worked well' for ten years, but as my mental health got worse (leading to my ASD realization) running my own business and artistic practice has started to break.  

The main reason is this mysterious 'lack of safety' -- meaning emotional safety-- the feeling of ease required to settle into your day or art practice without worries, crutches, addictions.  Strangely, marijuana turns this off Immediately and connects me to this whole other side of my brain (is it a left/right brain disconnect?)

On this relieving, joyful side of my brain, I can pursue my hyperfocuses (consciousness &amp; Terence McKenna research) I can make new music (future-psych beats &amp; vocals) and I can generally function as the beautiful weirdo I am.

But my sober, waking reality is mostly flooded by ultra sensitivity, depression, and this general anxiety or panic that 'something's not quite right' -- which makes it hard or impossible to access the place in my mind where these passions are stored.

Any shared experience would be Huge!!  Can't find anything about this on the NT internet.  &lt;3",7.687654320987653,9.93078865020576,7.836316872427982,62.92509259259262,63.73251028806585,10.17366255144033,38.60288065843621,10.380263240014207,4.821130041152264,1154,61,158,29,18,374,168,243,0.095,0.7290000000000001,0.175,0.9663,0,0,1,0,0,0,52.0,0,2,0,5,6,10,0,1,11,0,16,9,4,5,0,32,26,13,0,2,9,0,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,13,7,0,1,5,2,1,2,4,2,1,1,1,3,18,8,27,23,6,25,0,1,1,2,6,14,0,4,8,108,31,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13797368602240906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742645682112118,0.0,0.08606801256764368,0.0,0.09682128513588063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10415157259356583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42386259472204535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24487036274819696,0.0,0.1090095808970705,0.1284600234659139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1423677172114244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11374776385483025,0.12380409709491802,0.0,0.0,0.06399467461430286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11567740806759436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122497200107064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13472997017486474,0.11337668518805848,0.0,0.0,0.13453185197634562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375123999782766,0.0,0.08939605454223652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10628207236234044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142291537901045,0.0,0.2534478074386374,0.0,0.0,0.13786554379074334,0.0,0.0,0.12754696982885946,0.0,0.12779378709593694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12223651646001002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.148495847381298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774369717851671,0.0,0.13223267652767626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13461663159672166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13012910177904305,0.12496690263302575,0.0,0.0,0.21617031196237765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13203408853279314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743532320237974,0.0,0.0,0.08958280935232397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13766553216084707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379643736025948,0.0,0.0,0.14130443651507493,0.0,0.12200339572987015,0.0,0.09214026263248483,0.12853211330767875,0.12897975720311464,0.0899075936079142,0.0,0.0,0.08150321085108378
autism,ghoul_boii,2019/04/08,"I’m pretty sure I am on the asd spectrum??? I was on twitter and an autistic friend of mine retweeted autism signs in adults. I glanced at it just to learn something new about about people who have autism but I found that I fit into a lot of the signs? I didn’t think much about it at the time but it kept bugging me. So I looked up more symptoms/signs in adults and I fit into more of them. I was diagnosed with a language comprehension disorder at a young age and I’m thinking it might have been a misdiagnosis. 

I’m kinda scared that if I talk to my friend that she is going to get upset with me? Like I dont want her to think I’m just trying to um like make a small deal out of this since I’m not professionally diagnosed. I’m not sure what to do??",1.5935357142857145,3.2187614250000043,3.17464285714286,92.65750000000004,78.5,6.071428571428572,21.42857142857143,6.868970318607317,0.2585446428571432,588,16,137,6,14,194,92,160,0.073,0.759,0.168,0.9368,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,0,6,8,0,2,9,0,11,2,0,1,2,30,27,7,0,2,7,0,0,2,2,1,2,0,0,2,10,8,0,1,5,0,0,1,4,2,1,0,6,2,18,6,26,20,4,19,0,0,2,0,10,14,0,4,6,89,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872257379614789,0.0,0.3686484512311631,0.0,0.0,0.2081339042775632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21283852203148126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1991193998709041,0.2806135820873625,0.0,0.09488058857436862,0.0,0.10320973174243038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774450712398223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525016122249564,0.0,0.0,0.1543932168210492,0.0,0.0,0.12122207251630525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926531331811711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13349982718616846,0.0,0.0,0.17539426376032186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12590133956631006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847565441389369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1818172735821516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502246959489724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13980762273212607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3423192199735254,0.0,0.0,0.14596640693690674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34909350899109104,0.0,0.0,0.10589474612758318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12329718740733556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071147376271872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,fukuimamess,2019/04/08,"Advice on talking to NTs about autism I’m a 19yo female with high functioning autism and I find it extremely difficult to accept people’s dismissive reactions when I tell them I’m autistic. I usually get met with the classic “well you don’t seem autistic to me” or “everyone’s a little autistic!” I know that they’re trying to pay me a compliment but it just comes across like they don’t believe me or that they simply don’t care. I don’t tell everyone about being autistic, only friends that I deem close enough to trust so it’s disheartening when they dismiss it. 

I know I shouldn’t care what others think but it’s starting to get to me. Does anyone have any advice on how to explain this to others without coming across as needy for approval?",3.172710371819964,5.566103746575344,4.07577299412916,84.41575342465754,76.60273972602741,6.911154598825831,26.18199608610568,7.957251820313856,1.7735201565557728,601,23,110,10,14,193,86,146,0.068,0.73,0.202,0.9687,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,1,4,1,8,10,0,0,4,0,7,0,0,1,0,21,22,10,0,1,6,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,12,6,0,0,7,0,1,2,6,2,1,0,1,0,17,8,20,19,1,13,0,1,0,0,11,7,0,3,5,72,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33198179596239635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551457185126865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11877411992332612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19138059239387206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3463790168344475,0.0,0.0,0.2926486988674045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14865071002346905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17551678380417549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3246281108411295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15525426772566267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13123789900983646,0.0,0.17749574355870218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17947254849268393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18670760730613992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08298785171387392,0.17025016122804107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291905985947943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11776356058248427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15463944849536146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202318905578841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13653169907114893,0.29694040014342044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10884314849663744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532773081613075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18708318494502327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15272975810309178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16374457364239192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,OrsonWellesInASarong,2019/04/08,"I Interviewed at an ABA Facility  

This after-school organization for autistic kids had a kiosk at a career fair I attended a couple weeks ago, so I walked over, handed them a resume, and stuck around for a bit to specifically discuss my misgivings about ABA (and about the whole principle of delineating autism in terms of ‘functionality’). I think, at least at the time, my concerns were well met— the woman at the booth obviously worked with advocacy/outreach as opposed to on-the-ground clinical cases, so she shared some of my skepticism about behavioral therapy, although she felt the merits of the organization outweighed the potential for individual abuse. Her manner (paradoxically, her ambivalence about ABA) set me at ease, so I told her she could add my resume to the applicant pool for 'therapy assistants' at their behavioral clinics.  

So, I got the go-ahead for an interview at a facility which happened to be on the third floor of a bank. As I arrived, there was this reception area next to a hallway opening into seven or eight retrofitted classrooms, each of which was supposed to correspond to a different ‘aptitude level.’ One of the managers found me just sitting across from the front desk and invited me to ‘shadow’ some of the classroom activities while I waited for my interview- initially she led me to what I think was one of the lower-aptitude rooms, where there were just, like, three or four kids sitting unresponsively at separate tables, while counselors hovered around to maintain calm. There were homework-adjacent math handouts and that sort of thing littered around, but no one seemed to be paying much attention to them. Also, all the buzzy flourescent office lights were switched on- I asked one of the counselors how the kids felt about the harsh lighting and she sort of stared for a moment and said it hadn’t occurred to her to wonder.

Eventually the same manager came back for me and led me into one of the ‘higher aptitude’ classrooms, which was mostly full of teenagers, with a desktop computer pushed up against one corner and some maps on the wall.  It was actually kind of difficult to distinguish the employees from the inmates until somebody ‘misbehaved’ and they had to spring into action. They were all supposed to be doing multiplication tables. One of the counselors actually drew me aside and started blithely explaining how some of these teenagers are chronic masturbators, so they need to be supervised on trips to the bathroom. Rather than launching into a metaphysical discussion about the consequences of pathologizing masturbation, I was led at this moment out of the second classroom and into the manager’s office for my interview. She asked what interested me about the job and right away I brought up the fact that I’m autistic- I didn’t really examine my own motives at the time, but now I wonder whether there wasn’t part of me that wanted to impress her with my relative normalcy. In fact, that’s definitely what I was doing. Just for a moment, my subliminal strategy for getting the job was presenting myself as a model autist (who had presumably benefitted from some form of behavioral conditioning), in contrast to the dysfunctional subjects of her program.  

The guilt didn’t really set in until a couple hours after I walked out of the interview- I’m ashamed to say that initially I was just elated not to have made any major social blunders. And then I forced myself to keep thinking about how the counselors didn’t really pay attention to the kids they were supposed to be counseling unless the kids were fidgeting or shouting, which was the ‘misbehavior’ they were supposed to discourage; how they trapped these children who already have difficulty communicating in a harsh and repressive sensory environment without making any attempt to understand how this might impede their functionality; and how they pathologize the sexual habits of 16-year olds to an extent which would be outrageous were it not for the fact that those 16-year-olds happen to be autistic. I talked it over with some friends and it hit me that I obviously can’t accept this job if it’s offered to me, and as it is I took my morbid curiosity way too far. Part of me is still kind of grateful to have had an inside look at the whole process. Simultaneously, I understand that what I was flirting with was the possibility of grossly economizing my privilege as a ‘passable’ autistic person and I’m still guilty about how comfortably that role fit me.",13.431368821292779,10.178156313054496,12.075365019011409,55.33137452471485,54.31051964512041,15.691102661596956,48.35323193916351,13.662883650711644,6.542550114068443,3637,174,565,102,30,1164,360,789,0.071,0.86,0.069,-0.5154,6,1,0,0,2,0,72.0,0,0,11,3,42,22,2,3,64,0,49,6,1,14,7,112,85,50,0,6,16,0,3,1,1,2,5,3,1,8,36,37,0,5,19,1,3,13,10,7,1,13,41,10,72,15,137,33,24,91,0,1,2,0,52,49,0,17,25,452,108,25,0.0,0.0999559586886967,0.16465157615573087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07478240918998899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309629467857193,0.0674647898517581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147390053581262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22530196373855316,0.15773540059601387,0.0,0.07926149744553594,0.06486967922948593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921021765241239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09648841018585068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735672048521747,0.186691360497748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08814102549831766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16200276957492055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09249930383471178,0.0651783829362541,0.0,0.04407600864730829,0.0,0.047945244618714696,0.0,0.06747252700693443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14920324574926505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308022792673952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511507722375137,0.07498540969310268,0.0,0.17570145956891384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04121533504326013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084338830684117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07982599003181817,0.05631273157928824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08949545203725923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062016263030026,0.06255384448157053,0.0,0.0,0.08972064748515134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17704884364943654,0.0,0.4001642588690971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182713082455636,0.0,0.0,0.07366222192538431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09510622501918893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621346433897297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07204525189606717,0.08024820985785361,0.06708857442408488,0.0,0.0853795172564467,0.0,0.07680059850947757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08599710926903156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05971232595962394,0.0,0.13474426075857465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06780751164211922,0.0,0.0,0.19295211120685454,0.0,0.05604680362745691,0.16216856105345792,0.0,0.0,0.09838509259173683,0.0,0.0,0.0806121382615627,0.09373002093356728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17564901147781192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049759283461964746,0.06696315387015371,0.06767063830738664,0.0,0.07585216415769241,0.0,0.0,0.18837579740426505,0.0,0.08132259511254103,0.1829754152621509,0.061417022262358414,0.0,0.0,0.05992881418405641,0.0,0.0,0.10865357602160572
autism,StrangeFishThing,2019/04/08,"I am an autistic guy who does not like technology, but unfortunately has to use it on a daily basis. I have a rather... interesting form of autism, since I was young I have always had a distaste for electrical equipment, the things I am the worst at involve something to do with computers or electronics in general, using a computer for anything else than the internet can easily make me overwhelmed; same goes for things like phones or radios for example.

It really sucks that my particular form of autism makes me dislike technology especially since in this day and age our whole lives depend on it. 

The stuff I am really good at doing are things such as creative writing, piano and such, but everything has to have technology in the way now and it really makes me overwhelmed/annoyed.",9.675674044265593,8.910145802816906,9.605935613682096,62.323873239436615,59.28169014084507,13.466398390342054,39.29979879275653,12.540900571622839,5.200081287726358,632,27,103,19,7,208,93,142,0.128,0.768,0.103,-0.6085,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,1,0,0,0,4,7,1,1,10,0,14,0,0,6,0,19,20,8,0,1,6,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,11,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,0,0,2,0,11,4,19,18,5,12,0,1,0,0,6,7,1,3,6,82,22,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15544948122976973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15373721426255707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048365821377036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16348773058978916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15606441426220025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16790206722924786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156696029985102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18498149950857254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825419541027574,0.0,0.16496577495156894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741120648136637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35904566347756545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30907941664895194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438234179944695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.213864582585384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37234537986762783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3227055659913933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14828928295149674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20857822778673998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,AnaisMothThing,2019/04/08,"Help with writing a good autistic character      Hello, I'm Anais and I was recently making an autistic character. My reason is simply that autism fascinates me. I myself was almost diagnosed with it as a kid before they diagnosed me with ADHD and I still have several things about me that have lead people to believe I'm autistic myself, which is probably why I'm so curious about it. I understand that not every case of autism is the same and that using it as a joke is deplorable. I feel as though I understand the basics but I'm also worried that my own disorder is going to take over because the only real reference I have that I know well is myself. I'm also worried that I'll end up doing it wrong and do more harm then good. Right now he's simply a quiet teenage boy with some sensory issues, the occasional breakdown and a few obsessions. I would appreciate any feedback and I hope that this is appropriate for this sub.

autism,billpaxtonma,2019/04/08,"Question about ABA My son turns 3 next month and has been receiving 20 hours of in-home ABA therapy each week. I've been doing some reading recently by autistic authors regarding their negative experience with ABA.  I'm now coming to the realization that my son being autistic is what makes him, him.  I don't want to strip him of who he is and what defines him, but I also want him to be able to succeed in the world.  He's high functioning and incredibly intelligent.  Any thoughts, insights, or opinions on ABA are appreciated!

The basic ideas are already in place (low lighting, enclosed area to help control noise and distractions, special “waiting” area with activities instead of standing in a line), I was just wondering if any of you had some specific ideas on how we can make it as enjoyable as possible for the children and for the parents too! Even if it’s just a suggestion of what not to do in this setting, that’s helpful as well.

autism,pinktrashcat,2019/04/08,"Autistic Wedding Help? My fiance (recently diagnosed) and I have been engaged for approaching two years and have yet to figure out how to best accommodate his autism and hesitance toward a wedding (we've considered elopement but I'd like to travel for it, which is another major stressor almost of the same weight). Some of his reluctance and fear stems from not being confident he'll feel okay that day; disappointing everyone; having the pending date on his shoulders for x months; everyone watching him; etc. At his brother's wedding, where he was the best man, he was three klonopin deep and slightly intoxicated \_just\_ to make it through, which he doesn't want to have to do at ours. We've looked into trimming the guest list, but according to him, anyone more than the two of us and an officiant would be enough to make him anxious. We're at a loss of what to do and worried another year will pass by with panic attacks triggered from invitations.",10.233965517241376,8.79130708045977,9.236178160919538,67.58288793103449,58.6551724137931,12.608045977011495,43.014367816091955,11.45678717892309,4.985795402298852,768,37,129,17,8,241,121,174,0.19,0.722,0.08800000000000001,-0.966,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,2,0,0,3,4,10,1,2,8,1,15,4,1,4,0,25,21,10,0,2,4,1,2,1,1,3,2,0,0,1,6,10,1,0,2,1,0,3,2,5,0,3,3,4,11,5,29,13,8,19,0,2,2,0,20,9,0,2,8,93,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619081660116943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33909000463536537,0.0,0.18266253401335986,0.0,0.11305670018397501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18394456654782365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33936523593133616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104276021357203,0.0,0.0,0.16411091975536027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16706794726506058,0.1803259626811821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3090015149962646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18194506422645415,0.08175481077336834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083767207037894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07899307253284073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13577802788987958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.215857310658574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290586079818542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897071901132168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15964836979440689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31589329478324824,0.0,0.1944919448713123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09536835460800007,0.0,0.0,0.19689362867109345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16420301634632956,0.0,0.1148592183147238,0.0,0.0,0.2082448147666039

autism,blue_m0n0chr0me,2019/04/08,"Understanding During school today, I had a meltdown. I was just sitting class like usual, not doing much. Then, I don't know, I suddenly felt if was too much. Like, everything felt too much. But this time, there was nothing to set it off, it was so random and I don't understand. It's probably because I've been stressed lately but I'm not sure. I felt exposed, unsafe sorta.

&amp;#x200B;

During said meltdown, I went to the bathroom and hid in a stall. I sat on the floor trying to calm down, but I felt really uneasy. When I did try to come out the first time, I had to run back in because I wasn't used to the noise (as the bathroom was rather quiet). So I became slightly more sensitive ???? Also note the 'meltdown' wasn't severe, I did cry and such but it wasn't like ""I was raising hell on Earth"" type of meltdown.

&amp;#x200B;

When I did get home, my dad started questioning me about it (I hate when people do that because, like, ??? It makes me uncomfortable to talk about because I can't explain it. They wouldn't understand anyway). It eventually got to the point where his questions became too much and I had another ( ""I was raising hell on Earth"" type) meltdown. So yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone help me? Like, my parents sorta see my condition as something that is black and white. I hate it. Because when ever I TRY to actually explain (or at least what I know) was wrong, they don't understand or think it's something else. I don't know. Sometimes I don't understand because I just don't, they don't seem to get that. It's really infuriating because I have emotions I want to. convey but it feels like no one understands or listens. I really can't do this anymore, it's too much. I feel like some people don't see ME, like I'm not human. Or I don't have emotions. It's difficult to get people to understand when you don't want ot understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I really wished I had someone I could talk to about this (besides on reddit or teachers), I used to talk to the other people at therapy about this but now I don't. Where I live, getting help (besides in school) is hard. Like I don't have any one to relate to.

autism,TrickyPicc,2019/04/08,I went on a date for the first time in 5 years On Saturday I went on a date with a girl I met on a dating app. It lasted from roughly 4:30 to 9:30 and I had a wonderful time. I'm bad at thinking of places to go and things to do but she handled all of that. We did all sorts of crazy things I've never done before and she didn't mind any of my quirks. And she doesn't smoke which is nice. She's really great. I like her an awful lot and can't wait to see her again. She seemed to really like me too. I'm still afraid I'll mess everything up though.,0.27354105571847503,1.6323967500000016,2.319266862170089,98.51253665689151,81.5,6.121994134897361,16.11143695014663,6.980632752743323,-0.5095548387096769,423,6,111,5,11,142,82,124,0.098,0.75,0.152,0.8349,0,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,1,0,0,1,4,7,0,1,7,1,8,0,0,0,3,18,19,7,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,7,0,1,3,0,0,3,4,3,0,1,7,2,15,4,19,12,3,23,0,0,1,0,10,8,0,4,14,69,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378916868685542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693058721322002,0.0,0.0,0.17254375374276168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2075058161176613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18223809946977967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17247747632898666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523981120744148,0.0,0.0,0.2235564786686677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16528597214508925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19812798816685112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17238922006472718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047415799235534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15639001003518302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118532342223496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598014442378454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16158276562974094,0.1845957100278523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16193371516393645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2694249709297584,0.12992789662597914,0.19922213325878715,0.0,0.23647557930015925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375942733505949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2198972231563384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13057830539106027

The more I hold it in, I get jumpy and forget words for specific things, yelling out whatever descriptive words come to mind. My parents (and my older brother especially) find this very annoying and don’t seem to want to be with me. I have no idea how to let out this frustration, so I sleep all day and retreat to my dreams.

autism,rosswoodblues,2019/04/09,"am I going nonverbal?/is it possible to go partially nonverbal? I just recently got diagnosed with autism. As far as I know I don’t recall ever have going nonverbal before, but I’ve had a couple of experiences lately that I think come close?

Like I’ve been extremely stressed out for the past couple of weeks, and today it really hit me. I think I began to sort of shut down, but even as soon as I woke up I had a super heavy feeling. Like I had a hard time responding to a friends message, but then my mom started talking to me and it got worse. 

I was really overwhelmed and it felt really draining to talk. Most of the morning I just didn’t respond, but I did say a few words when she kept talking to me (like to tell her to leave me alone). It felt really forced though and I had a hard saying anything more than a few words. Even responding to a friends text I had a hard time formulating my response, although I started to calm down and it became easier.

When I got to school though, it still felt very difficult to speak, but my friend talked to me. I didn’t talk as much as usual, but I still responded a bit. It still felt tiring and a little forced, but it was much more natural and easier than with my mom.

Is it possible I went nonverbal? Like is it possible that different ppl make it harder to talk? I already thought I was going nonverbal, but then talking to my friend made me doubt it, because it had been far easier. Do you think I only went nonverbal for a little bit, or is it possible to be nonverbal but talking to certain ppl is easier? I guess I wonder that bc my mom stresses me out a Lot and it really affects me, but my friends are way nicer and caring. Or do you think I was just stressed out or something?

Sorry, this is long and confusing. Its 4 now and I’m still having a hard time speaking out loud fully, especially to my mom, but I don’t know. I guess I just wanna know how to tell if you’re going nonverbal, what it feels like, etc.",3.3978757346767448,4.6978178765743035,4.997196473551639,82.80518178001681,73.00503778337531,8.819781696053736,26.83534844668345,9.2995712137729,2.2296032577665827,1535,54,313,35,30,519,166,397,0.099,0.723,0.17800000000000002,0.9903,1,1,1,0,1,0,45.0,0,2,0,1,18,21,0,6,16,0,29,2,0,4,2,70,67,40,0,2,19,4,10,5,5,0,2,5,0,0,23,19,0,1,15,0,0,8,4,7,0,0,29,15,49,14,43,36,11,46,0,1,0,0,32,13,0,12,29,216,72,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06413904827335473,0.0683394254637805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0509617190909356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037750920455823865,0.0,0.05269642705345369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13521934142178196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0631400351317092,0.0,0.0,0.05334575199330977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370449850825721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06285592686950292,0.0,0.06470189885795631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906643104467082,0.08180612392439826,0.056017698114751935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060577766243424876,0.0,0.0,0.06262562436261096,0.08848318816358665,0.2378435411316012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392282774465309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17597641679919315,0.0,0.1485891703691395,0.0,0.13644202153223084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22190239237433132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102102532010201,0.0,0.06985782641966333,0.06557313416656407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15127521062349664,0.1241368632471806,0.0,0.05480460191788164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05264923106684042,0.0,0.05859806037057635,0.04133762504417303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2901187334311664,0.0,0.0,0.0910488607417835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047099267204517486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05911757527930855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27925943984262114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1983642925010241,0.0,0.06114673095240414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984957488835767,0.0,0.06267475172697179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0476754353959793,0.0,0.06932366826761957,0.08766634726496685,0.0,0.19782410023032446,0.0,0.2128159953936258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3982050115958165,0.10825613784821378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15872463136433432,0.1216884921647941,0.04916415739566998,0.10833267948742084,0.07117747756674958,0.05870079287059341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06820527974202664,0.05109733799314752,0.0,0.04915580666802143,0.04967515150480572,0.0,0.0,0.11481631993475334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715860602285713,0.0,0.0,0.06311023435673277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,RosyAngelina,2019/04/09,"Seven years later. Since the age of 17 i’ve been trying to find help to deal with my  depression and anxiety. Every single time I explained my reason why I  needed help, but there was something about me that felt different from  how others were. I tried to explain that as a child I had a hard time  keeping up with the rest. Social skills weren’t as fast and i’d rather  be alone than play with the other kids. I ended up being bullied which  caused my anxiety to fit in because how else would I survive school.

They  all said it was a phase, my anxiety was purely from being bullied and  obviously it’s why I became depressed. I believed them, took pills and  kept going to therapy every single week. I never got better. I kept  struggling socially which caused me to lose every single “friend” I had  and I started noticing I lack a lot of skills in the adult department.  They told me I was too close to my mother, I needed to be cut lose from  her, I told them if I do that I have a hard time trying to survive. I  forget to eat after awhile, I don’t take care of myself and hell, I even  forget to pee. They looked at me weirdly, thinking it was me trying to  seek an excuse to not grow apart from my mother.

6 years later at  age 23, I went to a doctor who said there’s a lady who studies autism  and helped women find out what was going on with themselves. I thought,  well, can’t hurt since all those years I didn’t feel better anyway. We  met, first time my mother went along (as she always does) and asked me certain questions. She asked me to come in the next week to talk to me  personally and if I was okay with that. My mother told me she could be  trusted (i’m not always sure) and I agreed. Week later we went trough my  entire childhood and adulthood, how I did things, how I react to  light/smell/touching/stress etc. It was odd to me, things were asked  that I was never asked before.   


A large part of my family has  autism, however only the men have it and as I thought what was tought to  me is that it doesn’t happen to women. Turns out, it does happen to  women and they’re now trying to figure out how women react differently  to certain things. There are similar things and things that they’re just  discovering. She asked me to meet with a man who has helped people for  40 years, she told me he was gentle, calm and trustworthy and is good in  listening to people who felt ignored.

4 months passed, a month  before my birthday I finally got a set date to meet with him. We talked  and he asked me to fill in tons of forms together with my mother, he  told me to take my time and see what I can remember. I did, there were  moments I was shocked when my mother told me how I was when I was  younger. She said that she always noticed I was a bit different, but  everytime she asked for help she was told it was a phase (as I was told  aswell.)   


A week before my birthday I hear it, i’m on the  Spectrum, I have autism. It’s almost two weeks later and i’m still going  trough a lot of emotions and i’m trying to place them, but it’s hard.  I’m happy, but sad at the same time. Happy because I finally know why I  have been doing things differently than from people my age, sad that it  took 7 years and I wonder what could’ve happened if I recieved this  diagnoses sooner.   


I couldn’t go to school, I was constantly  overwhelmed and work was something I struggled with. I felt hopeless,  why didn’t I function like others, why was my body making it so  difficult for me to go out and just do things like it was supposed to  do?! Now I know and it’s okay, because my brain is a bit different,  that’s all. It's taken seven years with help, but i'm just finding out who I am after years of trying to be someone i'm not. It feels like my life is only now beginning at age 24.

autism,Digital_Moonshine,2019/04/09,"New here, looking for some advice about eye contact / greeting people Currently my therapist is considering I have autism, and I don’t think it will take long before they diagnose me cuz I fit a lot of the symptoms...

Anyway, every morning and afternoon I travel by train and bus to school and home so I come across a lot of people. And every time I find it very, very awkward. For example asking people may I pass when they stand in my way, walking past them, looking at someone, people looking at me, greeting the bus driver, come across people I know and greeting them, all that kind of stuff. I absolutely cringe every time I have to do these things. 

Especially coming across people I know. For example: I recognize someone from far, we’re walking towards each other. When he/she notices me I just keep smiling at him/her till he/she says hello and I say hello back. Sometimes I got this voice crack which makes it extra awkward. So after we walked past each other I absolutely cringe inside.

When I notice people in the train making eye contact sometimes, I look back but immediately look at something else again. And that’s how it goes the whole train ride.

So does anyone have a bit of advice to make it all less uncomfortable?",3.9906493506493534,6.377903995670997,4.73982683982684,80.67259740259743,73.97835497835499,6.651082251082251,26.15151515151515,7.62386473244151,1.6401307359307364,977,35,168,13,21,314,132,231,0.029,0.928,0.043,0.2542,1,0,1,0,0,0,32.0,1,0,4,0,14,3,0,2,7,0,8,4,2,5,2,32,26,18,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,1,0,14,14,0,1,4,1,0,9,1,2,0,0,1,10,28,1,25,23,11,39,0,0,7,0,12,12,0,4,16,115,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18528231071950574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06628900638745341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08862873554552753,0.0,0.0,0.14579650791462465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067103307316423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350117241253397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24499518263352904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962238398096809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08296342564025189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07919639217586752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396288173068852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08664893624629309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07582324234243172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09509591989639278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426595450800764,0.0,0.0987235467514322,0.10420335491681627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08389836087737698,0.39805648596772975,0.0,0.0,0.16119756492642076,0.0,0.0,0.1898467754021657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915620802596414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21586946088446246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18100186814277813,0.4600750228493096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507835399863668,0.0,0.09594648540953647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16065386814041122,0.07298458056189,0.18752672258568906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10852764504343897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09853742582168158,0.07128064313104528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11007449410910657,0.0629834180291868,0.060746433403015776,0.0,0.0,0.11056169154149458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156446092218531,0.0,0.07525082680523272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058450333167784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

How can I be sure he is understanding me?",2.250173745173747,4.36360112162162,4.319343629343631,82.92391891891893,78.32432432432431,8.012355212355214,26.787644787644787,8.841846274778883,2.219029343629344,289,12,59,7,7,99,54,74,0.075,0.861,0.064,0.3049,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,0,4,0,8,0,0,1,1,16,15,8,0,3,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,6,2,2,13,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,4,3,33,6,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22415109411345055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536202891557107,0.0,0.0,0.22945241265147584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076863289239694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26192196934208783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2473829920969965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676132805462653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2867293636207927,0.1812982246208139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24141026928076226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14935812940947288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5333045301042367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23030190960464095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28005044721533445,0.0,0.0

autism,Kamiuq,2019/04/09,"Is anyone else feeling offended by all of these ""Autistic"" memes out there? It seems as though the internet is disparaging us as a group by taking lightly the use of the word ""Autistic.""

""Autistic"" is being used as an insult in the internet and there are memes that poke fun at us, how some of us have sensory overloads and how some of us have meltdowns.

In fact, you know about that ""REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" fad? That's supposed to be an autistic kid screaming.

I've just been noticing this on the internet more and more and it's disturbing me greatly, like how people used to use the word ""gay"" or ""queer"" as insults.",6.525329192546579,7.042476191304349,5.900621118012424,82.01913043478261,65.34782608695653,9.006211180124225,34.68944099378882,8.841846274778883,2.8589875776397515,482,21,90,7,7,147,73,115,0.139,0.787,0.07400000000000001,-0.853,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,4,1,0,0,8,8,3,1,9,0,9,2,0,7,2,23,17,13,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,7,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,3,6,3,18,14,5,5,0,0,0,2,9,5,1,4,1,66,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060521008353495,0.15540517250147567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12670191071713913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668956746308014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16721814581268588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335458098759152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409893690435462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17267878250566598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10514978355289566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13807585689154947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140379433168418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14901628405838382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7297676056559549,0.5239812292054146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Rebekah3333,2019/04/10,"Is it bad to purposely stim to prevent meltdowns I don't know if its ASD that I have but I have all the signs and struggled socially and acdemically my whole life. I mean trying to get diagnosed but in the meantime, I've been looking up some things to help autism. I've never really stimmed, at least I don't think I did, I did hit my head and throw things when I get really fraustrated (Which I believe to be a meltdown and I just never knew their was a word for it). But aside from that and lip picking I never stimmed nor did I know that was a thing. Since learning about it, I've tried some of them when I get fraustrated,nervous, or angry and it helps alot, I feel like it gives me control. I don't want to be purposely giving myself signs of autism or making myself have something I dont.

autism,MGTB4,2019/04/10,"Thoughts on elopement? I teach young children (2.5-4 year olds) with autism. Many of these children elope and I am trying to help them get what they want/need without allowing them in dangerous situations (e.g. pointing/using a visual to get something vs leaving a supervised area). To better understand my students, I have a few questions for you all.

-What does the urge to elope feel like? Do you notice when you're doing it or is it hyper-focused on the objective?
-Is there anything that helps/helped with safety during this time?

My students parents are so worried that their children will leave their house and get hurt--they are nonverbal and don't respond to their name, etc. I'd love to pass on resources for families as well if you have any suggestions?",4.992761904761903,7.366492085714285,4.552857142857143,83.20047619047621,71.0,7.238095238095237,30.95238095238095,8.07648339933343,2.3684523809523808,612,27,105,9,12,185,104,140,0.051,0.821,0.128,0.8999,1,0,1,0,0,0,27.0,0,3,6,1,4,5,1,0,5,0,11,1,0,1,1,16,18,8,0,1,4,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,3,8,5,0,0,4,0,0,1,2,1,1,0,1,1,14,4,17,16,3,11,0,0,0,1,19,5,0,3,6,67,22,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181677519355816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14299571730280689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15368309377746606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15206497280462758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937965207012454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16381238602674986,0.0,0.08786198971514407,0.12413942451699793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723587941113419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23294517422916586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200504183303198,0.1860215345593972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36798905230058543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08489394643316757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15683181133376106,0.0,0.0,0.17617281187865685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978352716598705,0.18233959560262528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19294807035674413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946591926179275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1953217740313066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337745900998123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13795186029413942,0.10132513506851833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11797661946858873,0.0,0.0,0.18089793223547573,0.20902071814871329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024924810228765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15623770992238953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16750551769247835,0.0,0.0,0.17646917162355552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11190047166750723
autism,John9798,2019/04/10,"I wrote about what's been helping me the most with diet/exercise/supplements I don't know what's best for anyone, but this has been what's helped me after trying a lot of different things over the past few years.  I was in very bad shape a few years ago and did almost give up.  

Never add/change medications without talking to a doctor, I have no formal education on this subject so don't do anything based on what I write.  It's just the personal diet/routine that's helped me, especially with some of the neurological issues, focus, anxiety/depression.  Often I don't even know exactly what's helping what, but this is where I'm at.  I am in a much better place than I was though.  It's been a lot of different things coming together.  Being able to get a lot of nutrients in me was one of the biggest things since I couldn't stand to eat vegetables, and then going out in the sun more, targeting possible nutritional deficiencies and gut health issues, etc...   And this is all still evolving as I learn and try new things.  But it's been enough where I'm able to do volunteer work and get out of the house, do my own grocery shopping.  Hoping to get my own car soon.  It was a very rough 12-16 months starting from zero though laying in a bed almost all day every day.

It's terrifying posting anything like this because I greatly fear criticism and rejection.  Maybe I'm wrong on a few supplements or dietary issues.  But then again maybe something in there could encourage someone.  

Thank you for reading.

It's amazing to be in a position to be the person I wish I had supporting me at that time.

The kids are great, I can't wait to (hopefully) have a positive impact on them!

autism,wuzzywuz,2019/04/10,"Is 'child-like' taste a possible symptom? I've been diagnosed pretty late a few years back in my twenties. Something I've only thought about recently is that I don't like a lot of types of foods. As in, really really don't like. Most of these are pretty strong flavoured like mushrooms, asparagus etc. It gets to the point where a bit of lemon sprinkled in my food can ruin the dish for me because it'll taste like it's 90% lemon juice. Sometimes I'd rather order of the child menu because those are more bland foods. I've heard that over or underdeveloped senses can be a symptom but does this sound familiar to anyone else?",5.459672131147542,6.3086009918032815,5.446024590163933,83.17920081967216,67.77049180327869,8.722950819672132,29.1844262295082,8.841846274778883,2.1242262295081966,499,17,98,8,8,156,82,122,0.079,0.866,0.056,-0.1606,0,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,4,6,0,0,8,0,11,9,0,0,0,6,14,3,0,1,3,0,0,4,0,1,3,2,0,1,8,0,6,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,3,5,4,5,14,9,6,11,0,1,0,0,2,6,0,3,8,54,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10513826434268696,0.1540660673195722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11562091985338427,0.0,0.18332144984898585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16415894909154422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526166714107426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13158487434185764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12561013762833295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1676960206814081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5454635827710116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07855917778226218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16961755988887167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29384174587384804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127834411135775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11435887981672928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14214293264634814,0.1695132356304811,0.0,0.30594924453004635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926545327132339,0.0,0.1484666762607544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575783892739852,0.1487142077171307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31257230989809265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11937251470364535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968297250286652
autism,DjDapperB,2019/04/10,"Possibly touchy subject? CBD oil. I am the father of a 5 year old boy who has moderate autism. He is currently attending 35 hours a week of ABA therapy which has helped tremendously with his verbal communication, play skills, and socialization. But he still really struggles with denied access to preferred items, or activities. In his melt downs to whatever situation it may be, he has because aggressive, particularly to his twin brother and 8 month old brother. My wife and I do our best to intervien, but obviously can't keep our eyes on him every second of the day. We are considering CBD oil to see if it would help his, and the families quality of life. I fear that if we consult a doctor about this they may try to steer us towards a prescribed medication... I don't want my son to be sedated, I want him to be the happiest version of himself as he can. We live in Michigan, so Cannabis is now legal, but I don't really know where to turn for laws, brands, milligrams, and doses... And what the laws are for children. Trying to do this the right way and be informed as we can before trying it. Anyone here had any luck with this? Or know where I can turn for answers? Any information would be greatly appreciated.",5.457586956521737,6.734066356521745,6.587554347826085,73.4365489130435,68.04347826086956,10.097826086956523,32.20108695652173,10.270032843473604,3.455760869565217,962,41,175,25,16,323,142,230,0.051,0.8440000000000001,0.104,0.9484,1,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,7,0,1,2,7,7,1,2,10,0,26,5,1,0,1,38,34,17,0,7,7,5,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,2,10,14,0,1,6,1,0,1,3,3,0,1,1,4,24,4,29,24,3,20,0,0,2,0,33,8,0,7,10,122,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19791584768624185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10175028245821377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870704409759937,0.0,0.12382596826709955,0.0,0.15271323396278585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09384772958567253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14894488341473336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260605076097073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13718238144897693,0.1637493544990591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16043523357444198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19507666375475144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14330692239108114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12934399141067224,0.0,0.0,0.15994689577797544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10278438752507978,0.0,0.0,0.12849596093004687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14659510354417632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615189364671448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30539546567775283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16405083071933851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18644642122428406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427244820777153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595981874375932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635694757909095,0.0,0.1483383155224582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621167756183877,0.0,0.0,0.15212807555240104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16641368178659222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2963935879309744,0.3165658144293497,0.0,0.0,0.17504146409987306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17166177684557152,0.11550622493710758,0.11672658048823632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20674507370964884,0.0,0.0,0.09370947802509694

I don't want to live like this, and I probably can't. I just learned that this may be because of being on the spectrum, and that there is something called ARFID.

I honestly didn't even think people could be that casually evil. they've just been using me for their own twisted pleasure; to subtlely toy with my insecurities and laugh behind my back. Idk if i did something to turn them against me but i cant believe anything I’ve done would justify years of calculated abuse.  ive put up with their insincerity for so long and now realize theyve been laughing every step of the way in my slow downfall into suicidal insanity",6.858526170798896,7.609757938016528,7.182991735537192,72.29933608815429,64.66115702479338,10.420275482093665,35.96804407713499,10.355215969177356,3.8277825895316804,1039,48,184,24,15,338,144,242,0.16699999999999998,0.6809999999999999,0.152,-0.797,0,0,2,0,2,0,25.0,0,0,6,0,20,18,1,1,3,0,23,0,0,1,2,45,37,16,1,5,12,0,2,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,9,14,0,0,11,3,0,4,3,5,0,0,17,4,31,13,30,15,3,24,1,0,2,0,10,6,0,5,13,128,40,0,0.0,0.29586634125615296,0.12184080883805215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0873017622029463,0.12792905852846104,0.10274531286225452,0.11114773039987223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09600605558625204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14066922136080212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12729834823988673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09968683563448352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12777036963526495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043006219863552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08246577967339085,0.0,0.10519601547614743,0.0,0.0,0.12213248799694175,0.0,0.0,0.06313061532371828,0.0,0.11988071380709885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2893887959456289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07095817143903048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754224190193184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2697304017868449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33147916146409684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178304666266944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495811818820317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1731179547999365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2510282196054563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19898709421709745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10328163390760108,0.0,0.0,0.12727430366245496,0.0,0.19223949321110573,0.0,0.0,0.0883732577894156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13657148563420568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14496668200387555,0.0,0.08000226542286737,0.0,0.1982423993277617,0.07280415735374446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358067652747933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078349328079764,0.0,0.0,0.0736429190143125,0.09910436353393504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126625313692259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17738731358355406,0.13650972268241715,0.0,0.08040275043038786
autism,monitorcable,2019/04/10,"Can autism be diagnosed later in life? I read the rule that says this sub can't give a diagnosis. I get it. My girlfriend's dad struggles big time with basic tasks to the point that he could become homeless even though he has a good job and is a wizard for certain academic subjects like math. He has cancer and sees doctors all the time, but I don't think his doctors see beyond his ailments and I don't think he is aware of the possibility that he may fall in the autism spectrum. I'm tired of seeing my girlfriend cry every time she gets off the phone from hearing their ongoing problems that wouldn't be problems for most people. It's not my place, but if the situation ever arose where I can make a helpful suggestion; which type of doctor would evaluate him and make a diagnosis? Are there organizations that focus on older people who may not have been diagnosed because there was less awareness in the medical community 50 years ago?

autism,mykthesith,2019/04/11,"New Autism-related Subreddit, and a Request for Help Hello! I've created a subreddit that's specifically designed to let the world know what it's like to be autistic, from an autistic point of view - specifically, to translate the sterile and clinical terms used to discuss and define autism into relatable human expressions of joy and engagement.

My primary motivation for this is that I was undiagnosed until age 34. I spent decades filled with self-loathing, compulsive masking and not knowing why things just seemed off - and I want to help other people like me to figure it out sooner.

Reflecting, I realized that the reason I didn't figure it out sooner was that the way autism is represented is so often using terminology that nobody would relate to. So I'd like to invite everyone here to participate, if you feel like it - post, or comment, and let's work together to create a resource for our brothers and sisters out there in the cold feeling like aliens and wondering what's going on.

autism,ChronicallyOwlish,2019/04/11,"Advice for Social Inflexibility from Actually Autistic People Hi everyone. I would like to have my question answered by those who are actually autistic. I have access to a great deal of therapist and parental advice but would like to hear from those who may have experienced this as a child.

Now, for the question. My son is five-and-a-half and we've reached a new stage that needs support. Right now, from a parent's POV, it seems like the world is literally my son's stage and the creatures in it are his play actors to direct as he sees fit. He insists that I say exactly what he wants me to say in response to his actions. He insists other children play his games, by his rules, and respond to him the way he thinks they should.

This is in one part developmentally appropriate for his age, and also, I think, a way to exert more control over the randomness in his world.  In the past, social stories, social coaching and natural consequences have worked, but this time it isn't. This behavior has lead him to be unintentionally cruel to our animals because he wants them to react and move and also to playground conflicts that leave him frustrated.

Is there anything that helped you with the randomness and spontaneity of people/animals and your inability to predict those I interactions? I always fell into social interaction easily so I'm out of my element. I want him to know it is okay to feel the way he does and he who he is, but also have the friendships and animal relationships he really wants.

Thank you!",6.619202983902628,7.519649084805657,7.220111896348647,71.3009727129957,65.21908127208481,10.246486062033766,33.03670985473106,10.25414643259724,3.4643209265802906,1213,49,212,28,18,400,151,283,0.06,0.799,0.142,0.9677,2,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,1,3,2,3,7,11,2,0,14,1,20,0,0,3,1,42,35,21,0,8,3,4,1,3,0,4,0,3,0,2,20,15,0,2,8,5,0,4,1,2,0,1,0,6,28,9,37,30,2,27,0,0,1,0,52,12,0,6,9,144,48,2,0.0,0.0,0.2134101171306501,0.0,0.0,0.21370156082474212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2623297457688613,0.09098389474894833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08998171245606107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06665576691685371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263984375661108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11273001175937147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956886465947058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448394282166414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055288175362789724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205533747987708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123239891043615,0.0,0.07329172537779358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060093215327527434,0.0,0.0,0.11578068810610365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16026149918252675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621655207953335,0.0,0.08107801692197643,0.0,0.10560619299198837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409507948380957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428296191420496,0.11841010343951765,0.10438228448279424,0.0758061345857848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2449831061721111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07004928031382644,0.0,0.0,0.11739573174555143,0.0,0.09338013036270434,0.0,0.17391124774208805,0.0,0.0,0.08713389932597024,0.09954368555882888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4458542964603759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408354017790645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10067029048585442,0.0,0.12695810575096386,0.0,0.14012786846568698,0.0,0.0,0.06376001561641176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257978326351673,0.2603791869690496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07960454567667649,0.0,0.0,0.15535126420440645,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,YuukiSAan,2019/04/11,"Feeling of distrust of normal people Hi i am a 25m with high functioning autism, over the years dealing with people i start to have a sense of distrust and even hatred for normal people. 

I came from a background where i grew up being bullied which destroyed my self confidence and became a shut in till 3 years ago i decided to change back then all i did was video games and watched anime. 

But thanks to someone i met who struggled alot gave me inspiration to change things got better. I slowly changed to be more independent learning things alone and have a strong will to prove i am capable.

Overtime i became obsess with learning things and picked up as many skills i could alone. I study computer science and cyber security so i love learning things on the internet. 

I have dreams and aspirations to be able to live alone by having an apartment and travel alone.

Back to the main topic, from my experience growing up i had a fair share of people i am close with. The people i am closest with are people who have similar mental struggles aside from autism. I find such people easy to talk to.

However i had bad experiences with normal people who i tried to make friends with. Generally i am able to communicate or work with people normally (1000+ times practice to achieve this) but when its comes to being friends or be close to people who are normal i have dealt with constant betrayal (ghosting , backstab , seeing someone true colors)

after experiencing this alot i came to a conclusion that i can never trust normal people. The worse trigger for me is when someone is insensitive towards mental health which disgusts me. 

I grew this anger and hatred within myself towards normal people although i dont show it i just avoid them as much as possible. 

I also started to tell myself  that i dont need people, and i rather pursue more knowledge and skills so i can live alone to make myself capable. So i spend most of my days just studying and learning things and only talk to 2 people whom i am close.

I know what i think is toxic , but i dont feel normal people can understand and i can never be normal . I feel weak each time i experience someone who turn their back on me. 

Whereas with knowledge i feel satisfied and stronger with capabilities to prove i am not weak . 

I feel my anger and hatred is something that will not go away easily. 

Hope to have some advice.",5.339795488517463,6.992777625560543,5.740550346514473,77.97765932871316,68.70852017937219,7.917271368392446,29.210218779725512,8.391295532112219,2.237670553064275,1895,70,327,28,33,607,216,446,0.174,0.7190000000000001,0.107,-0.989,1,6,1,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,2,7,15,25,6,4,15,0,40,4,0,5,6,91,65,33,1,13,10,0,5,0,2,2,3,0,0,1,22,34,0,2,20,5,1,8,7,13,0,0,9,9,55,12,60,47,10,46,0,0,3,1,21,19,0,7,19,242,77,7,0.10832328242930213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05292612895167804,0.04801102701035663,0.0,0.0,0.2804756300101552,0.0,0.04331304491129445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0508866448133683,0.12494087668642323,0.04522270808096873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047901570255271315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238929774474127,0.0,0.0,0.17188750448328705,0.04665545810696036,0.0,0.05852949287748872,0.0,0.04324366333704225,0.0,0.0,0.03492977790266664,0.05583827386262026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19043112038614685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0357732532116731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15894143373615569,0.0,0.0,0.13692876586679598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049502758849328664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0836902992973587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030781308857797795,0.0,0.043318012239442566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05757129189864906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0572247476237282,0.0,0.05379473056340312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029765821562286295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565144295960652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048882995807878096,0.0,0.07230663216563239,0.05491140318592121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10916439078080274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03981503821107903,0.040160170680999856,0.08354559332801499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4776021790656612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041192368760768136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5632329364743209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061059112533387035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04315981571674978,0.0,0.05650240400191649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1835639313600194,0.041696277505417205,0.0,0.0,0.07667177684033494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132430143012581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706615120366214,0.04733966169257573,0.049864762384462066,0.0,0.0,0.1799129388815017,0.034704592739128286,0.0,0.0,0.0631641770972879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0367721991212454,0.058912312734745675,0.0,0.05638417861731977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03943031986629954,0.0,0.05519533955618932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06975664236614998
autism,NoSwagStanley86,2019/04/11,"Need a little advice for my son. Hi everyone! I've been lurking on this sub for awhile now and I've got a question for the group.
My son is 4 yrs old and has been diagnosed autistic. He's non verbal but other than that and a few stimming and eating habits hes a totally normal,happy, loving little dude. 
However, he will NOT allow anyone to touch his hair. His hair is getting long enough to cover his eyes and ears and he hates it. If hes watching videos on the tablet or doing a puzzle or looking through his books his hair will inevitably end up getting in his way and eventually he will become frustrated with it and begin to cry/meltdown. If I try to put it up ponytail style he immediately pulls it out. He is absolutely TERRIFIED of clippers and im definitely not confident enough to use scissors on it (besides he wont let me use them either) Does anyone have any advice/tips i can use to get him a little more comfortable with the clippers? Going to a barber is out of the question at this time. Ive tried and I'm not going to put him through that kind of stress ever again. 

P.S. - I refuse to restrain my son unless its for his own safety so if thats your advice just move along I dont want to hear it anymore.",2.7332702237521502,4.467643726907632,4.341113023522663,85.05783132530122,75.5863453815261,6.670567986230638,24.708548479632817,7.447530270364453,1.1854259323006309,964,32,192,12,21,323,146,249,0.119,0.813,0.068,-0.9053,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,1,0,5,6,2,1,11,0,19,8,5,4,2,40,36,18,0,5,12,3,4,0,0,4,1,2,0,0,13,15,1,2,2,2,0,6,5,3,0,0,3,9,22,3,33,28,7,27,0,0,3,1,30,12,0,8,8,126,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24085777757509216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08380755629379852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12222115432253645,0.1723448147223723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361091090014444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12508620016827932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784832206663443,0.0,0.14443658657150518,0.0,0.0,0.126105482833316,0.0,0.0,0.10915423002598308,0.2546801239607132,0.0,0.0,0.111477808829319,0.0,0.11776128430314844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19316374049360496,0.0,0.14008048178075974,0.0,0.0985664393336666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13119147547432325,0.0,0.12167417459253375,0.0,0.0,0.13890065262417547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331205549232773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283356947165782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12602144556847636,0.0,0.0,0.3705571446739676,0.0,0.10906369131864843,0.10349072200927052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11122908443056248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13098481987350796,0.0,0.09138104041288778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12074922128182287,0.0,0.0,0.12931984972842722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2477808632168096,0.2761144386046331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411712229571497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186234672434866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16734400063489085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3193198690340345,0.0,0.0,0.07269025797916838,0.09782232763944276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,TheSurferLurker,2019/04/11,"I'm an aspie in the film industry and the Art of Autism published our article about movie characters who might be on the spectrum! https://the-art-of-autism.com/which-autistic-tv-movie-character-are-you/

I created a special Reddit account for this (My life is usually a perma-lurker, hence the name).

I'm producing on a project called Stella Incarnated and one of the main characters has Autism. What drew me to the project though is that it doesn't focus on the character's autism, but just treats him like a unique character of many in a story. I was born with Asperger's Syndrome and was taking special education classes even into college. But I would consider myself pretty ""normal"" these days as outwardly you wouldn't really know it. Normal for the film industry anyways. This is the first feature I've ever worked on that has dealt with a character on the spectrum so the project is personal to me.

Because we exist on the spectrum, we're all different in a number of ways... which makes representation of an Autistic character very hard. I even feel unqualified at times because I've been able to change myself to be reasonably outwardly normal!

So we wrote this article to talk about movie characters out there that we know are on the spectrum or who could be. We're passionate about bringing this project to life and we want people on the spectrum to weigh in. The answers we're asking for are a mix of doing something fun and hearing from regular people about how they see themselves in characters on screen. 

Side note: Even though the article says written by ""Stephen Gibler"" Avi and Vanessa wrote a ton and did a ton of work as well. Credit where credit is due.

I posted this here because I've lurked here a bit and we would love any support and direction in this!

Thank you

autism,dieanotherday4,2019/04/11,"Talked to the GP today I don’t know how I finally managed to get the courage to call and get an appointment and they asked me if i could go almost right away and I did.

Last week I visited my sisters who live in another country and it surprised me how i couldnt even feel comfortable with the people i love the most.

So i managed to leave behind the idea that i wanna get the ASD dignosis to excuse my feeling bad and my deteriorated mental health.

The talk with the doctor went well.
I was of course pretty nervous but managed to keep the confidence. The doctor was very sensitive, I really like her as a profesional.

autism,sivvus,2019/04/11,"How do I help my 4yo autistic (non verbal) niece play with my pets? My 4 year old niece is fascinated by my bearded dragon. The first thing she does when she comes to my house is go to his tank and stare at him. Yesterday she got very fixated, then had a full on anxiety meltdown, because he wasn’t moving. 

We took him out to show her that he was fine (she usually strokes him nicely) and she shoved him around like a doll. He’s a very gentle animal so he just came back to me and hid in my hoodie, so she shoved at me instead. 

We took her out of the room and she spent the next 4 hours crying and trying to get upstairs, unable to focus on anything else. 

Some of this is pretty normal toddler behaviour, the problem I have is that it’s becoming more of a fixation every time she is here. She’s non verbal/ pretty uncommunicative and so if she is interested in something we want to encourage it, but at the same time she cannot understand what exactly she’s looking at. 

We have basic makaton, then “sleep, play, yes, no, ouch, good girl and tinkle”. She has a rabbit at home but it’s always been there so she doesn’t really interact with it/seem curious. 

Questions:

autism,throwmyilfeaway,2019/04/11,"is this autism, am I just too socially stunted, anxious? I swear I can never figure out social interactions, I'm always too blunt, or just afraid to speak or stand up for myself. I never can ease into a situation or make people feel comfortable. Any casual conversation at a cafe seems like it becomes too intense, and I never really get a feel for if others want to get away, which I usually assume is the case now.

I'm in a shared house for the first time like 6 years, I'm 30 though, and the others are roughly the same. Now everything seems hostile and passive agressive. No one is friendly, just rushing past, or swearing under their breath about whatever upsets them, a broken dish, door sticking, or just, rushing past me, which is always the case. Talked to them once since I moved in, and thats about it.

I'm broke, and not making a lot of money, living in a 3rd world, so therapy and any of that, is a no go.",6.279166666666669,5.911533027777778,6.966666666666669,77.17500000000003,65.94444444444444,9.644444444444446,30.222222222222214,9.120678840339163,2.4134888888888892,715,22,137,11,10,237,111,180,0.124,0.7659999999999999,0.11,-0.3839,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,3,1,13,10,1,2,13,0,9,2,1,2,3,33,23,14,0,2,11,0,3,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,9,8,1,0,6,1,1,4,6,4,0,2,0,4,12,6,19,23,2,26,0,1,0,0,11,10,0,10,13,95,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2469797755212757,0.0,0.0,0.2018492149619848,0.0,0.0,0.1676622500332207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13943707273874933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1639083515620281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13338228775605673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15008217858513434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262383686292027,0.0,0.0,0.11466201390809555,0.0,0.15507730289883914,0.0,0.08434542340019056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712464328610028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14501229110206926,0.0,0.13104968168407485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12617377279293146,0.0,0.0,0.1981310649533058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15773746564521282,0.0,0.0,0.34339126749087684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15805293129182132,0.10056717262234972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2833502925006017,0.10288953970806554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09507592291511434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702157033584693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12276715936634792,0.16682024540288293,0.0,0.30257276400077604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11928718530169875,0.0,0.0,0.16972097697203373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14581310924012106,0.0,0.0865396803886351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16345381110169455,0.0,0.08753668617327888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955718543764602

autism,i-diogenes,2019/04/12,"An outlier of outliers, apparently. ⚠️Rant, and possible trigger warning! ⚠️

im sure there a few people here that may be like myself but...well.

i hate the two sort of representations autistic ppl get in media; either ""low functioning"", or very ""high functioning"".

""low functioning"" autistic people are nonverbal, ""empty"" and distant.

""high functioning"" are constantly seen as wanting a job, friends, want to meet and reach out to other autistic ppl because they crave the idea of being able to relate to someone, and can live in relative independence.

then...theres me. i dont want friends, i cant hold down a job, cant function, BUT I CAN TALK. and thats what matters. i cant drive, my mum feels that i cant be left alone for extended amounts of time. i constantly am between wanting to kill myself and others. if the whole universe were to never talk to me ever again id be elated. im 27 and i have no goals, no aspirations, and no fucking future.

autism,TheL0nePonderer,2019/04/12,"Looking for some insight on rectal digging and ways to reduce behavior. Hey folks, sorry for the sensitive material, but as I'm sure many of you know, sometimes a person with Autism will engage in rectal digging behavior and smearing for a variety of potential reasons.  I have an institutionalized patient who is highly Autistic, and one thing that they are dealing with regularly with him is rectal digging.  He will also sometimes put feces in his mouth.

In a setting like this, I would expect the staff to try to determine why the behavior is occurring so that a plan could be instituted to address the issue.  However, what I'm finding is that they have given up on the issue somewhat.  It's my job to try to find the least restrictive alternative to institutionalization that meets his needs, and this issue is beginning to be a barrier to his appropriate placement in a group home that would be more appropriate for him.

So, as someone who helps make sure that indigent individuals who need care get the help they need, I'm a psychologist but by no means an expert in any particular condition.  I was looking for hopefully some insight into your experiences as to what has helped solve this issue. For example, maybe worked with someone who was doing this because he liked the texture, and successfully implemented an alternative that lessened the behavior, insight like that.

One thing that I was considering asking them to do is to try installing a bidet attachment, that perhaps he is not getting fully clean and this is leading to the behavior, however he also loves water play, so that may be a recipe for disaster.  However, in my limited research I've found that there are numerous triggers for this sort of thing outside of simply the area being uncomfortable for the person.

Anyway, any tips or things to consider would be very helpful.",12.63886022514071,9.808533664634147,12.057926829268293,53.55198874296436,55.34146341463415,15.21425891181989,48.09662288930582,13.397384779245865,6.533919981238274,1494,75,226,42,13,495,176,328,0.056,0.7909999999999999,0.153,0.9893,4,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,2,4,5,7,11,0,0,24,0,31,3,1,4,2,46,51,17,0,9,4,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,3,2,29,11,1,3,9,1,0,2,2,0,0,2,5,2,17,11,45,33,5,17,0,0,2,1,31,12,0,7,4,171,46,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16379102361399936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392816843968121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957375053733755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06242686810690809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10441161693117536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176432639750014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10557798524126052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10017451701382267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18719781904629404,0.0,0.0,0.1122849095947711,0.0,0.0,0.10700773824427738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745672631263585,0.10819950442804256,0.10272341228867296,0.1017140910095827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4275487098753743,0.10162397836614323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05628067008892288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15009389186929176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1719935852843862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09242707291866437,0.0,0.0683580277070384,0.1038254751463774,0.10288243877138142,0.11155215850003276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278023449226017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387884040124097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17883714982810206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029481633766688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052923144390292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735396592276254,0.0,0.20256794256053087,0.11463719144792685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19303635252115092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2721408710115401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20858460125379089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08449719214780692,0.0,0.08128657586360509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240714612928752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07455412642490669,0.0,0.0,0.2182427716905717,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Mekare13,2019/04/12,"7 year old hands in pants Hi everyone! My 7 year old son is a high functioning autistic kiddo, who is a great kid. Very sweet and making tons of progress in therapy. However, I'm dealing with a very frustrating issue and am not sure how to proceed. 

Lately, he has been putting his hands down his pants, mostly his backside, constantly. We've been speaking to his teachers, so I know he's been doing it at school as well as at home. I've bought new underwear, we gently tell him to take his hands out of his pants whenever we catch him and I'm not sure what else to do. I wasn't really worried about it because kids do stuff like this sometimes, but tonight he told me that another kid told him he was ""waving his diaper"" and it sounds like she was teasing him. He's finally beginning to make friends and seems to like the other kids, and I don't want him to struggle because of this. If he doesn't stop soon I'll probably take him to the doctor to rule out any medical cause, but I really think he's fine physically.

Any advice would be *so* appreciated. Thanks so much!",3.789369158878507,5.121803766355144,4.844941588785048,84.14909462616824,72.0841121495327,8.714485981308412,27.860981308411212,9.188382445141503,2.2241971962616818,842,31,173,18,16,276,128,214,0.048,0.7809999999999999,0.17,0.9801,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,2,0,0,1,7,14,2,1,5,0,17,5,3,4,2,29,32,15,0,3,5,1,3,3,1,1,2,2,1,4,10,11,0,1,3,0,1,2,5,3,1,0,9,6,22,11,23,21,3,23,0,0,0,0,37,8,0,3,16,97,32,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266028700512923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1762081717369027,0.13585317259711896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15795507275802026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13309206125449327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14000649448029973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13356891708766566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13260840858829687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10822933401722727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12379850651953013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14192478348087256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10009642020268453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428384817124504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13688545583485678,0.12995753714748612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13522520355399914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120185273063706,0.0,0.1461474041109478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18988692152670156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1729623408556864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13051635572938974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952402567232278,0.0,0.0,0.12512821222622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27189928089602744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13968575877505274,0.0,0.0,0.13024187444914306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16599672737123294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13111991508537424,0.0,0.11794500927923975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12813647022463076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083165389609609,0.0,0.13544246393769424,0.14831325547540036,0.0,0.0,0.2442143265557089,0.0,0.1948234338064572,0.0,0.11323966358864575,0.11927987474886853,0.14816120569641753,0.0,0.0,0.08301572648070225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24759701303906026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137983297624108,0.07641684132091117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11648846986948184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315727412528921,0.0,0.092034498196783,0.0,0.0,0.1668625932714498
autism,789DidYouHear,2019/04/12,"How to find someone that's right for you? Hello,

This is something I've struggled with a lot the past few years as I've been looking for a life partner.

I seem to go for people that either and up being some form of abusive or just don't treat me in a nice way. In the past I've just not told people when things upset me. I used to change my life and sacrifice my routine to make the person I was with happy. Which just ended up with me being unhappy. 

However, my last relationship I tried really hard to talk about what I need for it to work, and I thought I'd found someone I could be with. But I failed at being able to communicate with my ex properly about things. He told me that it's really hard to read and understand me because my facial expressions and tone of voice don't change. Every time we talked he just thought I was digging at him and in the end he got so distant it just didn't work. He couldn't cope with me needing the routine and not being able to talk in any other way! 

I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do differently. I don't get how I'm meant to meet someone that's a good person and who is right for me and understanding of all my needs. People are so good at pretending to be someone their not and I'm so bad at telling until it's too late!

autism,thatcrazyanimallady,2019/04/12,"My ASD friend thinks I may be on the spectrum? I’ve always joked that I think I’m autistic due my awful social skills/weird quirks, but today my friend (who’s diagnosed ASD) told me that she genuinely thinks I’m on the spectrum. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD/OCD/RSD/Anxiety/Depression so far (all on the severe end of their respective scales), but I still feel like there’s a puzzle piece missing and I’m honestly not sure how to evaluate whether ASD is a possibility for me or if my issues are solely due to the aformentioned disorders. When I did my ADHD testing ASD was one of the potential disorders flagged based on the questionnaires I filled out, but as we were testing for ADHD that’s what my psychiatrist and I pursued. I’m just at a loss as to what to do - how to figure out if there’s any merit to the possibility, which specialist I speak to etc etc. I’m more than happy to answer questions if it helps you form an opinion/shape your advice for me as I’m so confused!",6.2469990723562105,5.96809166836735,7.0723562152133574,76.09342300556587,65.98979591836735,10.596660482374768,32.61410018552876,10.230975488527342,3.1489448979591828,781,29,153,17,11,261,117,196,0.087,0.7559999999999999,0.157,0.9458,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,2,1,1,9,12,0,1,11,1,9,2,0,2,2,30,21,18,0,3,10,0,1,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,8,6,0,0,7,1,0,1,1,3,0,1,5,2,21,9,25,14,6,15,0,2,0,0,13,8,0,8,7,101,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4943327397264617,0.1339806825419203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11408512199668483,0.0,0.0,0.09323837251560456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11809121191758512,0.2783241570000178,0.0,0.0,0.3142760711876728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12143729289920473,0.0,0.3058240830242948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06932609610351813,0.0979502251451684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21185912599493456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14595437693309626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09190082985725066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14310548458889366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06698420907736717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929081592471857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30913810379354195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15359271897455867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15489339731488194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13976468567536238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10949489704686516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292229873824859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2635604633076244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12996267420302354,0.1310128940555381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am asking this for a friend. I was asked if there is anywhere that a highly skilled autistic adult can get help developing skills for interviewing for a job. I myself have worked as a caregiver with intellectually challenged and autistic adults, but something like this never came up for me. I am in the Indianapolis area.

autism,laubanniang,2019/04/12,"Ideas for managing son's extreme emotions My son oscillates between uncontrollable, prolonged giggles and similarly uncontrollable, prolonged anger. This is particularly frustrating when I'm trying to do lessons with him. He will find something, anything, completely hysterically funny and is unable to settle down for an inappropriately long time. I'm certainly not trying to be a jerk by sending the message that he can't laugh or can't giggle! In fact I acknowledge that he finds something funny and give him some time to settle. However it becomes very disruptive and draining (due to the way it often just ends up with a meltdown by him) when we're trying to get tasks done.

What I've tried so far is:  
i) stay quiet and avoid any additional stimulation and hope he settles down on his own (NOT useful because he'll just giggle and giggle with no end)

ii) rationally talk to him calmly about the negative trajectory of his behavior if he continues (NOT useful because it has zero effect or it tips him over to a tantrum)

iii)  enforcing negative consequences - such as taken away a toy (NOT useful - it stops the giggles immediately but he swings to the other extreme - yelling, screaming and extreme, prolonged anger)

My son is 7yo. We are in the midst of have him go through a diagnostic assessment. I suspect he is autistic. He is highly verbal and very intelligent. However he has problems with rigidity, anxiety and as described, emotional regulation. Can any parent or anyone who has ASD please enlighten me as to how I can manage such situations better please? Thank you",7.859956035171863,9.208114284172666,8.303117505995202,63.04162270183855,62.633093525179866,11.21374900079936,38.82573940847322,11.095144083064902,4.941124060751396,1273,65,190,35,18,421,169,278,0.134,0.7290000000000001,0.13699999999999998,0.6963,3,1,2,0,1,0,35.0,1,1,0,3,10,22,5,4,12,0,19,0,0,6,2,49,31,22,0,3,11,4,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,11,16,0,3,8,1,0,2,9,11,0,1,2,3,17,11,34,26,2,24,0,0,0,0,29,10,0,7,10,127,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1754831667240052,0.0,0.09870395060289554,0.0,0.0,0.0902174433708604,0.0,0.10617677365118468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212234542875459,0.0,0.0,0.15730516975730616,0.14249823359497996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11411233406011595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352805026992272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13203761065265635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29027204312279603,0.22855612063344924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358534521773981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741035927444969,0.12377276104663272,0.07332801368452202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13632224335330848,0.0,0.12815116982620128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456537838123493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11418327161403005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14326725288785094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2832619220467809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234597233874424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14502976859477454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19865985696942232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13752373174271515,0.0,0.1078708727188546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10370559543804864,0.0,0.1187891000800306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15047130269732362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3503986569030599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3343091261338533,0.0,0.212918660793038,0.0,0.1024142248600132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,hp9700251,2019/04/13,"I dont like talking. Everytime someone says ""hey"" or ""good morning"" or ""i love you"" or anything like that i would much rather just be like ""mhmm"" than actually say it back. It makes me really angry when people expect me to talk to them when it isn't necessary. And another thing — I'm on facetime a lot with my girlfriend. We call each other all time and just enjoy each other's company while doing our own things. So a lot of times when i call her, i dont have anything to say. If i dont have anything to say, then i'm not going to say anything in the first place because i dont like the vibrating feeling in my throat. So let's say i havent said anything for the past 10 minutes. my girlfriend will go ""are you there?"" and I'll just kind of hum in response, she'll say ""why aren't you talking?"" or ""say something"" and it makes me really angry. Any advice on how to reduce this? It happens a lot and i dont ever want to be mad at my girlfriend because she's very sensitive.",3.3374876847290658,4.027105285714288,4.8876600985221685,85.84656403940888,72.49753694581281,7.573399014778326,27.80049261083744,7.7094869923839395,1.538907389162561,755,27,161,9,14,255,111,203,0.104,0.836,0.06,-0.7775,0,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,2,3,1,1,13,9,1,0,6,0,18,2,1,3,2,31,29,18,0,5,10,0,1,4,3,3,0,9,0,0,11,9,0,0,1,0,0,2,9,1,0,1,1,10,25,8,18,22,8,20,0,0,0,1,28,7,0,8,15,112,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.08269536917512503,0.0,0.0,0.0828083021709958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057627048755989924,0.0888587325291512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34867470345880913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06516089547883216,0.0,0.10331512539240616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17306086063318346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4965813695441684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07665343566512578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04284779123049647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208098010429995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09632096567812387,0.0710770545053837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0749365282582685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08824511372983848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665380914599348,0.0,0.16560144405080976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2161322893775389,0.07648240988072395,0.0,0.1131310670917468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062294669578857285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808952421441492,0.05874900749408149,0.0,0.08853671265392002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10857500429480313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08060846418574819,0.539118014800924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07180110182266825,0.06523805945125354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20433574967255969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259682355362538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988267679321496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06992051873487208,0.049982665357359776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07646592067659144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06019784965180875,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Ed-Grimm,2019/04/13,"Neurodiversity Stack Exchange proposal effort I hope this isn't too off-topic for the subreddit.

While reddit r/autism is a very welcoming place, it's also a very active place, and posts can get lost in the mix.  I've also not found it to be very effective for searching for answers.  Asking a question usually gets good answers quickly, but results vary a lot based on who is reading just then and how many new posts come in right after.

Stack exchange sites are horrible for discussion, but they're better for getting questions that happen to be on topic for one of their sites answered in a consistent manner.  Stack exchange is trying to set up reference sites, not forums.  There is currently a &lt;a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/121277/neurodiversity""&gt;Neurodiversity Stack Exchange proposal&lt;/a&gt; in the works.  Autism spectrum is not the only type of neurodiversity that is to be on topic for this site, but it is easiest sort of neurodivergence to point at.

Stack exchange sites can be easier to search, because duplication is suppressed and questions generally have tags from a limited dictionary.  Figuring out the appropriate tags for a question is generally easier than guessing key words they would have used in their question.  For example, a question on stimming would have the [stimming] tag on it, even if the person used other words in their question to describe the behavior.  Even if the person who wrote the question doesn't know to put that tag on, somebody else will add it in later, if the OP doesn't update their own question in response to comments.  Other aspects of questions (and answers) can also be edited by others, though the intent is that only the OP of a question or answer make semantic changes; other people editing should only be to improve clarity.

The rest of this message is technical information about what is needed to have this proposal succeed.

---

This proposal is roughly half way through its four month proposal period, and at the current rate, it's not going to make it by the end of that time.

What it needs right now are some more people to ""follow"" it, and a lot more unique questions that have been voted to 10 for on topic for the proposed site.  Each person is only allowed to submit five questions and vote up on five questions.  Note that stack exchange moderators will prune down the question list a bit once it gets close to finished with the current phase, to comply with stack exchange policies.  Overly broad questions are not welcome, if they somehow get that far, they'll be pruned out at that time - so no ""why are people autistic?""  That said, in the ""definition"" phase, it's preferable to have questions refer to CountryX or something similar when they would be asking about a specific country.

If you don't have a stack exchange account, signing up on area 51 and registering your email address will get you 50 reputation.  This will be enough that you can vote up other people's questions.  Voting up good questions is probably more important right now than submitting new questions, although if you *do* have distinct sample questions to ask, that's still important because some of the existing questions will likely be closed.

If you've voted up a question that gets closed later, you should be able to undo your vote on that question and apply it on a different question.  You just can't undo your vote from 5 minutes after you voted until the question was closed or edited.

What it needs for the phase after that: At least 200 people to 'commit' to it, at least 100 of the people who've committed to it to have at least 200 rep on at least one stack exchange site (area 51 does not count), and &lt;a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/53733""&gt;a really complicated formula that measures significant stack exchange rep and currency of commitment&lt;/a&gt; of at least 500.  The proposals currently in commitment struggle most on the 100 people with at least 200 rep on at least one stack exchange site.

The final phase before going live is private beta.  At this point, the people who committed to the SE are supposed to contribute ""expert level"" questions and answers as much as feasible to seed the initial site for when it goes to public beta.  I know the least about this phase, because it's a long way away and it sounds like it just takes the involvement of the right people rather than teeming hordes like the commitment phase.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  Have at least three wonderfully good days when nobody else told you to.",11.317590731434956,9.940894097989947,9.873534338358457,63.65654383026245,56.51256281407035,12.211278615298715,41.83472920156338,10.922573925877558,4.69601044109436,3666,157,563,67,36,1136,321,796,0.023,0.8809999999999999,0.096,0.9957,6,0,1,0,0,0,123.0,0,13,8,7,25,14,0,1,51,0,65,0,0,9,6,134,99,42,0,20,23,0,1,3,0,11,0,2,1,3,55,26,0,2,44,1,13,5,12,2,0,8,7,4,23,12,123,70,23,116,0,1,0,0,69,73,0,47,36,405,78,7,0.029986977611368905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07194172548544532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08410132836661803,0.0,0.028173752576821493,0.0,0.0,0.05483934966848116,0.0,0.02551670930201244,0.0,0.0,0.02652104483136811,0.03273801299250559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03172224618149193,0.025831125983736374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019339119798570916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031330009201040836,0.0,0.0,0.02624180618638504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050100543898749884,0.0,0.02655956155716689,0.030984563896934218,0.0,0.039612231796775435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032849268221368806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03287917316422313,0.0,0.0,0.10966870694557294,0.0,0.03408458085342237,0.07545496229369969,0.0,0.0,0.03303403660067194,0.0,0.026517385268219142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02978383492149472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03296011733598762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04395036768050654,0.0,0.026479050617736432,0.026537531550907045,0.0,0.0,0.03273432837945259,0.05098771204143721,0.0,0.0,0.04003308081657204,0.030402088655682162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02393531943694045,0.0,0.022043878890222,0.0667048918056492,0.0,0.05792321967548991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03193515248703063,0.06095985629563193,0.09122579095363656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18710275106810026,0.0785504165958037,0.06266001840208169,0.0,0.056694772980959485,0.0,0.057438470770930686,0.0,0.03233103369381247,0.0,0.0,0.030145194958217724,0.9069914997078452,0.0,0.029995092513383295,0.0,0.01921042571828886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10243486013618812,0.02852448265718894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023085440396406316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023947639056197314,0.0,0.0,0.0313488998702754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0225464752383396,0.0,0.0,0.027607980107046837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0294620532509686,0.0,0.05245694338222564,0.0,0.0,0.028653842171356875,0.0,0.02035918940121226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0517982412959296,0.033026419310636525,0.07422719105919165,0.0,0.04760453409797627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027058583118260825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032519598060705986,0.021830876844256213,0.0,0.0,0.06390566558009214,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,mediameter,2019/04/13,"Think my GF may be on the spectrum; do any of these symptoms sound consistent? I suspect that my girlfriend may be on the spectrum, and I trying to learn more about it, and how to find ways to support her if she is. Do any of the following seem consistent with being on the spectrum?

\- very little ability to stick to a schedule without being late  
\- very, very, very messy  
\- can not organize at all  
\- often stares off into nothing for long periods of time  
\- often unable to focus when being talked to  
\- can not do more than one thing at a time, if sending a message or reading something, etc. absolutely unable to multitask   
\- difficult time making friends  
\- difficult time relating with others  
\- difficult time understanding jokes  
\- difficult time feeling empathy  
\- unable to handle and work through stressful/difficult situations  
\- always obsessively searches all of amazon for hours and hours for items, or other sites for items

I'm sure there are many things I can add to this list, these are just the things I thought of off the top of my head. If these things seem consistent with the spectrum, what types of things can I do to support her? If she gets an official diagnosis, what good does that do? It is who she is, right?

autism,kenonoreeves,2019/04/13,"Having a few relationship bumps due to behavior It’s super hard. I’m extremely high functioning in most ways but in terms of personal relationships and certain work things I have always, always struggled deeply. My boyfriend is the only one who knows about how I am, even though I was diagnosed years ago as “on the spectrum”.

We have a great relationship, but we just struggle sometimes because I completely shut down. If something isn’t completely perfect or done an exact way, I literally have to go lie down in bed immediately or I’ll have a meltdown. I take medicine and go to therapy to help, as well as try and have a set routine.....but if I wake up late or have a bad thought or something goes wrong, the entire day is completely shot. Anything my boyfriend says wrong, I have a meltdown. And it makes me so incredibly sad. He is a human being and will not always be just perfect and I feel like even though I tell him he is enough, my freak outs make him feel otherwise. :/",4.323386809269163,6.194251213903747,5.047401069518717,81.07972905525848,71.62032085561499,8.409126559714796,30.64848484848485,9.029198982220553,2.652688698752229,775,34,147,16,15,250,118,187,0.152,0.701,0.147,-0.0201,0,0,2,0,0,0,24.0,2,0,0,4,10,14,0,2,11,0,19,2,1,3,4,32,29,21,0,2,11,0,3,1,0,1,1,1,1,2,4,9,0,0,4,0,0,2,2,7,1,1,3,4,18,7,17,23,4,21,0,1,0,0,15,10,0,7,7,97,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477444183698903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29504792883821457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09726599770480616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09868949473875037,0.0720517480161612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3717816791535531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07622723801455929,0.0,0.0,0.11996739018385995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095649069994195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212901887724273,0.0,0.15613590757547438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11952783273747958,0.08443990636850539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13434807190823198,0.0,0.0,0.13031252636150562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10588122797064213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07922490690382017,0.124881540031321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06495793850306959,0.0,0.13333127895613492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057745046877416724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15779472962809954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009329489621421,0.08989408712131704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10320499526963277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3806977883453594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09399493831583823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18198753387916072,0.11689978046414665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2471301772568424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886937731826257,0.0,0.10330932161733546,0.0,0.13516848395192627,0.0,0.07852478451042258,0.0,0.23225575609962976,0.09383515520489034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08024795297996867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876384338612346,0.0,0.0,0.10627322986558436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08604876864130187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25845956381314505,0.0,0.07611494403941033

autism,tay165,2019/04/14,"Daughter not diagnosed yet, therapies starting soon Hi everyone. I feel like a bit of a fraud even posting here because my 2 year old daughter has yet to be officially diagnosed with Autism (if she will be at all, I’m not sure). She will be starting speech, occupational, and developmental therapy within the next week or so and we are on a “wait and see” approach to autism. I don’t even know what sort of responses I’m looking for but maybe some moms, dads, or caregivers that have been through this before? I have no idea what to expect from therapy or how it will help. My girl is super bright but fiercely independent and I just don’t see therapy going the way they expect it to. Idk. I’m rambling. Thanks for reading if you did! :)",2.846287726358149,5.2570256408450735,4.154446680080483,83.34281690140848,77.80281690140845,7.437424547283702,27.748490945674053,8.418075326091056,2.1603927565392347,579,25,112,12,14,190,97,142,0.045,0.804,0.151,0.9574,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,1,1,1,1,9,5,0,0,5,0,15,2,0,2,2,28,28,13,0,4,10,4,1,1,0,3,2,1,0,1,6,6,0,1,3,1,0,2,5,0,0,0,2,6,11,5,14,20,3,16,0,0,4,0,12,3,0,7,10,76,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748838253039913,0.0,0.12212484125871405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15668653008952613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29133930022696997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18958704521131384,0.0,0.0,0.13713938914345902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725679601223596,0.10253062600982098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156565129198927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619834566098236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16201646741597964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07887476887955562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011656052139216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12052054698920632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14418500289773373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16808874077231328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15263501322524967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15059996416331772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13745236585992632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14355871160269376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22873351453910784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20316820972710892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526578189635766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13213381663523982,0.6565099310227835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391939495607062,0.1151229852049214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09242209278401133

autism,WindowsKidd,2019/04/14,"Few questions about interacting with autistic people: * Do autistic people understand sarcasm? They seem to, my autistic friends and I make jokes all the time.

autism,fakeariellejane,2019/04/14,"Driving Issues Does anyone here have any tips for autistic people trying to learn how to drive? 

I’m 21 now and about to have to retake my temps test for the 4th time because I keep letting it expire (it only lasts a year). I’ve been trying to do this since I was 17, but so far all I’ve managed is slow back roads during low traffic hours.

Being able to drive is really important to me, and it’ll help tremendously with my independence, but getting behind the wheel triggers a meltdown for me almost every time. There’s just so many things going on, so many things to think about, that my brain goes into overload mode and then shuts down instead of trying to process it all.

Have other people experienced this? If so, how did you get past it or work around it?",6.847799999999999,6.219009746666671,6.747833333333336,80.07975000000002,64.86666666666667,8.833333333333334,29.416666666666664,7.6454224807358475,1.7596666666666665,602,16,116,5,8,191,105,150,0.039,0.916,0.045,0.2094,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,1,0,1,15,1,0,0,4,0,12,1,1,4,2,21,18,14,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,12,6,0,1,2,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,3,1,8,0,21,12,2,22,0,1,0,0,2,8,0,3,10,78,20,4,0.17930892474377713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17955198701037692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219362175907968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12537696932100978,0.0,0.0,0.1596229587216093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13787749504857594,0.0,0.10930505623853794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2001680610358648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15691444838479998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15107550262714275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18736302495135368,0.0,0.10190539410768082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12018699258583745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17658317184027136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871519315113242,0.0,0.1593780110597001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1461607057095632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833555241018472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3635822120831936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13637251723724514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17117065789567912,0.24862046263637835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148698886582899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832619547535378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23824976418630706,0.11489391879876175,0.0,0.0,0.20911295196454424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36521696926224095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13053903277245646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11546906866096845
autism,plzGiveMeLove,2019/04/14,"Am I autistic? I’ve been socializing a lot lately and I keep on running into people who call me autistic. 

I’m not sure if they are just being mean, or if they are genuinely concerned. 

I did take one of those spectrum, and I scored pretty high, but I take that kind of thing with a grain of salt.

I am able to make conversations very easily and I’m relatively successful.

They keep on being up that I talk about one subject a lot (the source of my success), and I don’t have a lot of friends (I do).

Also, I do have issues with eye contact but I’ve kinda over powered it.

One lady said I was able to teach myself when I was young how to view emotions and stuff. I never really had issues with it.

To be honest, I just assume people are calling me autistic to insult me because I’m “smart” and more financially successful than them.",2.7091071428571425,4.3780155059523835,4.542380952380952,83.86928571428571,75.48809523809524,6.942857142857143,24.5,7.7094869923839395,1.278364285714285,647,21,129,9,14,220,99,168,0.035,0.799,0.166,0.9757,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,4,4,6,9,1,0,5,0,18,1,1,2,2,30,28,14,0,2,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,8,10,0,2,2,0,0,1,3,1,0,3,6,4,23,8,20,19,4,11,0,0,2,0,14,6,0,8,4,99,31,4,0.2934846376956126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11734977936605115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08945275555666163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29968062863685024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16506535772763575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1133727515317546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15504131657507544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30632171205154296,0.0,0.2608626307884139,0.0,0.15280954376357467,0.0,0.0,0.16553172730583868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37426521578827215,0.0,0.0,0.09795163730369087,0.0,0.0,0.1598454042101333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11317672267243276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298309178917005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20346529461603208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14928969308412296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400688700572768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13958554887715674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14958531436937486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16798484728854715,0.0,0.0,0.1383028988900475,0.0,0.22066392293328327,0.11794591738962147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09748907621748218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12107778114830055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I suffer with intense sensory overload - typically more noises - and I cannot fathom people breathing, drinking or eating within proximity of me. It sends me into a total rage and often sometimes have a meltdown. 

&amp;#x200B;

With this being said, my very thoughtful brother has bought me VIP IMAX tickets to the new Avengers showing. The last time I tried to watch a film I ended up exiting briefly into the ads due to popcorn crunching, whispering - all the normal 'lark' to be heard when in a cinema. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to see this film nonetheless but with it undoubtedly being the #1 must-see film I'm a little anxious and, actually, quite worried that it's going to be busy and overcrowded. 

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily (I hope!) I've got an 8am showing and my seats have been booked so I've got familiar family members on either side of me therefore there's less of an incentive to panic - but here I am... Panicking. 

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you reading this suffer with something similar I'd like to hear from you - how you cope? any tips? 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you all have a wonderful evening.",4.496282240235813,7.276726940677968,5.111739130434785,76.6897089167281,74.08474576271186,7.833161385408991,33.14222549742078,8.716276077567194,3.3397699336772284,1042,54,164,22,23,334,151,236,0.1,0.774,0.126,0.6379,0,0,2,0,0,0,66.0,0,4,0,1,7,10,1,2,13,0,12,4,1,2,6,36,29,13,0,5,5,1,0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,10,13,2,0,4,10,1,2,1,5,0,0,9,6,19,5,26,16,7,20,0,2,2,0,11,11,0,7,8,104,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.06298722715102384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4895461659834688,0.5490100641827029,0.08778648783464184,0.0,0.0,0.07291819329414785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06551245898913519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06323014772402426,0.0,0.06604629656435705,0.0,0.0,0.0571682728266396,0.0,0.0,0.042631781962136184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084787853517081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07077095522532928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036682770783245534,0.0,0.10324607839817383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07274761961242318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12821675515619707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05261330582163168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031533736039307515,0.06469168117912692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062338574721543874,0.0,0.0,0.06324101616767698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07573039338736783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044747814984542264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686522259516466,0.06456310013154845,0.0,0.04134958539188247,0.0,0.06373102590875432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06139767794265024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05143451288243628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0496903818259288,0.06383728162927603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04288125062140296,0.0,0.0,0.10248404583409136,0.03763707776164248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043822248033445504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05325690712794556,0.03807068676131672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06999698583674244,0.0,0.06554922360021596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5490100641827029,0.0

autism,Azraekos,2019/04/14,"Is it normal to experience heightened levels of fear/anxiety when home alone overnight? I'm on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum ( to such an extent that some of my closest friends forget I'm even on it). I would have been on the lower end were it not for my mom working hard to get me as ""normal"" as I can be(I'm in my early 20s now but I was diagnosed ~2). I'm not usually all that worried about most things, and the biggest anxiety I deal with is social (I'll gladly talk to friends or anyone that tries to talk to me but i have difficulty talking to someone i don't know). 

Almost a year ago I moved into a new house (Dad felt it necessary to downsize) and things have been going well.  But whenever I'm left home alone overnight, it's like all my fear and anxiety is cranked as high as it can go. The sound of the AC unit, the dog moving under the blanket, the house settling...every noise gets my heart racing and I end up having to double/triple check all of the doors into the house just to feel safe enough to try to get sleep. If my Dad's home, the fear and paranoia aren't a problem at all. 

Any suggestions on how I could go about fixing the issue or should I just accept that it's a part of me I'll have to live with?",3.485931690445309,4.319368879377436,4.533197146562909,87.99208279290966,72.26848249027238,7.42317336792045,25.561824470384785,7.594959193182576,1.1320109814094257,970,29,210,11,18,317,139,257,0.113,0.792,0.096,-0.0959,1,2,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,1,10,10,0,2,18,0,19,3,2,1,4,39,32,17,0,7,10,3,3,1,2,2,1,1,4,0,13,9,0,1,4,0,1,5,4,3,1,0,5,4,19,7,38,24,9,31,0,0,0,0,11,16,0,6,11,136,32,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08596907600575605,0.0,0.09711389839796583,0.2008891061539176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06595138067428083,0.0,0.22257388928381425,0.0,0.0,0.06781237268837208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743258188139926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09998463079513628,0.0,0.0984351288740288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2576929513878804,0.1002087791858746,0.0,0.06405598288210075,0.0,0.08171188332048948,0.0,0.0,0.09486742975650078,0.0,0.3273966023435101,0.049037232540922966,0.0,0.09311834535409533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498567756046354,0.0,0.15200795662269428,0.0,0.16535205632125974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08687721142101483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492465104166565,0.0,0.2049345320946074,0.2918438657897117,0.0,0.0,0.33571412258964817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122446409197018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05329900932362819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10537169812389426,0.0,0.0,0.047380718397757364,0.0,0.08563726587311728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11358465436901732,0.0,0.2061539579497096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936662389295464,0.0,0.0,0.1900443876674579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050225249695306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09279909141225676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09705247338462053,0.09886137800458006,0.08217290146491116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338524200515956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288616393378657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13168941295387046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068124492895362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08719885513593073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07060436688400676,0.09849036919450496,0.0,0.06889353843141056,0.0,0.0,0.0624535076930168
autism,urquhartloch,2019/04/14,"Should I tell my boss about my Diagnosis? To make it short, I have been diagnosed with level 1 minor Autism. I was told that it was extremely mild and as a result shouldn't affect my life too much since I can live on my own. However, I have an internship working in prototyping. As a result my day to day activities change, well, day to day. Recently we have been working on a project and I can tell my boss is getting frustrated with me. I think it probably has to deal with the fact that I have trouble putting A and B together. Which, according to the person who tested me, is my biggest struggle when it comes to my Autism.

I don't know what will change if I do tell her. However, its being pretty tough on me to not tell her. Any advise?",3.613733984136669,4.8239865906040285,5.056485661989019,82.93602806589386,72.35570469798657,8.90811470408786,27.63941427699817,9.339509955726095,2.2724845637583893,578,21,120,13,11,194,87,149,0.073,0.889,0.038,-0.6072,2,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,1,0,0,2,4,5,1,1,7,0,19,2,0,6,1,21,25,7,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,1,10,8,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,4,1,0,5,0,24,1,17,16,2,15,0,0,0,0,12,7,0,1,6,87,34,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10690197249637737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325953223990354,0.13541461763674584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055261879956039,0.16206717951987226,0.0,0.1595555594436922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08213095885672039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08639347911363181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11103561333483752,0.0,0.0,0.13881123560166875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049327918382308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11556071667296194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13726172364334116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15992978493478796,0.16948911047102122,0.0,0.0,0.15803027910677828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552168801125011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300381722714296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643404663017302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5496019070228947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10072796081509144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15021215427856102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14134244830286125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288881903484284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,SomethingAboutSean,2019/04/14,"Temple Grandin is having a lecture at my college, and I'm going. Hey all, just wanted to share my excitement with you amazing people. Temple Grandin is going to be the keynote speaker at my college's annual humanities lecture, and I've purchased a ticket. It will be this coming Tuesday, and I'm really looking forward to it. 

Dr. Grandin has had a very big impact on my life, to the point where I've wanted to follow in her footsteps and become an advocate for autism later in my life. I was very moved by her story, and I was inspired to start writing down my struggles as someone with autism. Frankly, she was one of the first people of prominence that I knew had autism. Reading about her and listening to her story lead me to start making waves of my own. I started educating people on the facts of living with autism, I persuaded people to do their research and to not do business with harmful organizations like AS, I started speaking my mind more, and I stood up for myself whenever I was getting bullied or teased because of it.

All I can say is, I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to listen to her speak in person. I hope there's a chance to meet her, but if there isn't that's okay. I would just want to say to her that I respect her and all that she's done to make the public aware about our cause.",8.297679487179487,6.420877665384616,8.381538461538465,73.56179487179489,62.73076923076921,10.35897435897436,37.82051282051282,8.59863814320734,3.208974358974359,1043,42,195,11,12,342,139,260,0.032,0.8759999999999999,0.092,0.9032,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,1,1,3,7,12,1,1,11,1,21,3,0,4,4,37,44,14,0,6,6,0,0,1,0,2,3,7,0,2,8,14,0,0,2,2,1,7,2,3,0,2,9,8,35,9,42,31,5,27,0,0,1,0,27,13,0,3,10,142,43,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735507475206565,0.15826490466819046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720979525113012,0.0,0.12344128558491416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14664686947596295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218919181736016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07486895672365088,0.0,0.162882736192703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14233041465838447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20243573544666485,0.07000972253173972,0.0,0.12653757530273205,0.0,0.12033690744875553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1913093128434974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14469335033157318,0.0,0.0,0.15230648545381956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09710459434278684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3973880046518236,0.1251250708663332,0.0,0.0,0.13546594266004566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433399683552972,0.0,0.09180241112184248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2279177143919989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12141863242535207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4057172766175721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14980951678591128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547154659643029,0.253568262266499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10179705316669688,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,deanisded,2019/04/15,"Why do I have to speak when there's no need? I want to preface this by saying my social skills are quite passable, at least in my group of friends who don't mind if I info dump or if I struggle to word something correctly.

However, I'm really struggling with trying to communicate that I dislike speaking when I don't have to, and being pushed to do it is really annoying and I hate it. What I mean by this is like, when my parents call me down for dinner by shouting ""dinners ready"" upstairs to me, but then will yell my name followed by ""dinners ready"" because I didn't shout anything down, even though they can hear me walking down the stairs. Or when me and a group of friends are getting up to leave and go somewhere else, and someone says ""everyone ready?"" which I'm clearly signifying that I'm ready because I have my coat on, my bag on and everything I usually sit with at a table put away. They still make me say out loud that I'm ready.

This stuff really irks me because I don't have to speak. There's literally no reason I should have to say anything. I've been told food is ready, so I know to get it. I am quite clearly ready to leave. I hate saying redundant things, and I prefer to only speak when it's stuff I can actually contribute to a conversation or if I'm telling someone about something. The weird thing is, everyone knows that sometimes I just don't want to speak because I have nothing to say, or I hate how talking feels, so I don't get why they insist I verbally answer them for these things that are quite clearly answered by actions and context.

I really don't know how to communicate to people just how much this stuff frustrates me. I know it's stupid and I probably should just answer. Maybe if I understood why I have to give a verbal answer it would be less annoying.",6.240682451253482,5.890121000000002,6.628884401114206,79.50767200557107,66.01949860724234,9.74267409470752,33.82743732590529,9.255337874911486,2.8383848467966577,1425,57,284,23,20,463,165,359,0.122,0.77,0.108,-0.6503,3,0,2,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,4,4,20,14,8,2,6,0,33,4,0,5,4,55,60,30,0,11,12,1,1,1,2,4,0,16,0,0,25,12,4,0,14,0,0,6,9,11,0,0,4,17,45,3,42,50,3,27,0,0,0,0,30,12,0,8,9,193,70,0,0.0,0.0,0.0832330057355432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.140376632366764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08013494708671713,0.0,0.0,0.20797363891426165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08709300018466253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07125079315215263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05633477632001506,0.0,0.0,0.16300094351803787,0.07665524212246709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04312636232012902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313581807397848,0.0,0.1317932775969444,0.0,0.13368515866758945,0.08182017016048514,0.04847359391891985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526255387463266,0.0,0.0,0.09613064924940913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18749772516028368,0.0,0.0,0.1806245140908818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04166952176398711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05693328931257685,0.0,0.08568760463449455,0.0929083463399993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08612093424612911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06269967281203517,0.0632431783293757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184028628387045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06486865666084378,0.0,0.0,0.09470703336166812,0.0,0.0,0.05913095892173895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09195955232616104,0.0,0.0,0.08574234462763504,0.0,0.27215665976328,0.0,0.0,0.21856178998531725,0.08769471562344143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4069672818350303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08694478432759667,0.1445358205528667,0.1313243977418566,0.08435629044681085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811456100452043,0.0,0.0,0.1783321142954914,0.2929179187017281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685547401026198,0.07454925155216854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16999329262554222,0.0,0.0837992763617422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08150047175901894,0.0,0.05790789001025073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09393744609296102,0.0,0.10061524638838576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23088917110111096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060589220597415526,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,acceptablelocal0,2019/04/15,"Re-Diagnosis? I was recently diagnosed with learning disabilities (unspecified). However, I was somewhat disappointed that I didn't see ASD on the new report. I know it sounds shocking, but learning about ASD from my psychology classes, it made me realize that I have some symptoms. It sounds cliche, but I do have poor communication skills, over-sensitivity, etc. I was also diagnosed as a selective mute when I was smaller, if that helps. 

I was wondering if I can be diagnosed again? I've seen many posts about how people struggle to find the right diagnoses and finally got the right fit on Reddit and other social media channels.

Please be friendly. I do need help because I feel like I'm ostracised from groups at work, school, etc., because of what I am. The problem is I don't know what I am or what I have. The new diagnoses report is only good for school, but I feel like it affects my social capabilities/social life and the way I function every day.",6.221949152542372,7.506535559322035,7.095833333333335,70.46036016949155,66.28813559322033,10.193785310734462,34.52401129943503,10.317481424215053,3.831312994350281,762,35,130,19,12,254,108,177,0.08,0.764,0.156,0.9409,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,2,6,8,0,1,7,0,19,7,0,3,0,26,30,13,0,4,6,0,2,2,1,0,7,2,0,0,11,4,0,0,9,1,1,0,2,4,0,0,9,6,21,4,12,19,4,15,0,1,2,0,6,6,0,6,9,87,32,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09355235334481338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426251645416388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544523667866193,0.0,0.0,0.5936833330110934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26093697777719393,0.0,0.0,0.09856437186850872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118301618495534,0.16714730553084364,0.0,0.1281506522269517,0.10692158902473883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903818291629511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09812093394323552,0.09356308233509897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15682430605873565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12858309371214555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262951568393427,0.1143053019408897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11069343344825662,0.0,0.11860378331815798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674242334223897,0.0,0.2259684547758162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08897188007237848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08110222804914895,0.0,0.0,0.12841370154151133,0.0,0.0,0.11203868291082973,0.0,0.0,0.11193823692867758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11550794600459274,0.0,0.0,0.1998080147290734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23678884301976505,0.09322139181162764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23850165310369856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12229745691442355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12159154634413942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285674269065368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12686455215848133,0.08516601001351362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Ostia99,2019/04/15,"Canada Revenue Agency with holding half of our disability child tax credit This is more a heads up, as the CRA don't tell you this.

Our 4yr  old daughter was diagnosed in Jan (she was 3 at the time), and we filed for her back pay separately from the taxes as we did our taxes before we got all the official documentation, so this was easier to spot)

Our back pay is due this week, but we noticed it's only half of what we should be getting (2017/2018 only)

So we called the CRA last Thursday to be told by the CRA, she's eligible for 2015/2016 but we have to write a letter to the Winnepeg tax office for them to release the funds even though we filed all the correct documentation, and her Paediatrician even wrote a separate letter to cover all the bases as she knows what the CRA are like.

We went to our MLA Friday and she's going to fast track it.

I just want all the rest of you  to be aware that the CRA could be holding a lot of back pay you are owed.",7.5670256410256425,5.5087469333333345,7.867179487179487,77.24948717948719,64.28205128205127,10.71794871794872,32.43589743589744,9.150863307647796,2.436897435897436,752,21,161,10,9,248,109,195,0.021,0.934,0.045,0.6738,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,14,3,1,0,9,2,0,0,17,0,16,2,1,0,5,30,25,11,0,3,3,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,9,13,0,2,1,0,10,2,1,0,0,2,8,0,25,2,25,11,7,15,0,0,0,0,33,3,0,1,11,115,34,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4683309810833832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1727555966168438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20730675469257695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16209544716983135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2060616583403449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268186412925782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10606989591654438,0.0,0.11538129840871833,0.0,0.16237413814213025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083577301899795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115748247069351,0.16548890418189238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09918562121144073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17260087320804368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2311403243877473,0.2130359916242908,0.0,0.0,0.3088126638217417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774489726071262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19946673086591488,0.0,0.11838295765901223,0.0,0.0,0.19399490510664055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197468232644689,0.0,0.16285089739651298,0.0,0.0,0.18820215108282887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Jcad15,2019/04/15,"For those of you diagnosed as adults What really led you to look into it? I’ve always struggled with some things that made autism make sense as to what made me feel so “off” in respect to the rest of my peers or family. So I finally told my therapist. Always thought I was just strange, had some quirks or what have you, but I started wondering a few years ago if I was actually just autistic. Therapist agrees and I’m being tested Wednesday. So for those of you who were diagnosed between say 17 and up, what led you to finding out?

autism,mastergr33n15,2019/04/15,"I took the Aspergers quiz online and I don’t know what to do. Here’s a little backstory.
I was diagnosed with ADHD by a child psychologist at the age of 8 and for the past 11 years that’s what I believed. 
    I wouldn’t call myself normal; in fact I’ve always been known as either quiet for most people or weird by others. I have always struggled with maintaining eye contact with people, I have never “opened up” to anyone even my parents, I’m always trying to figure out what facial expressions to make, I have to think about how something should make me feel versus me actually feeling right then, It’s really hard for me to have conversations because i never know what to say or what tone I should use, even if I say something and it sounds clear to me people will have a hard time understanding me sometimes. Honestly I can go on but I’m just going to keep this short so just comment if you want to hear more
Now at the age of 19 after going through a certain event that left me questioning everything about the way I feel/show my feelings to people and just flat out not knowing how to communicate well I started researching and stumbled upon the Aspergers test so I took it and scored a 36, then I took it again and scored a 36. 
I really don’t know what to do, I’m not sure if I’m being overreactive and using this as an excuse for just being socially awkward, or that I just don’t have adhd and this could be a possible explanation for all my abnormalities.

autism,Cavenge,2019/04/16,"I have had the idea that a diagnosis for Aspergers or autism might be accurate for me I have always had a very hard time communicating with people. In my head I tend to get stuck. I can’t explain it but I feel like I can never communicate well with someone (although people say I am very well spoken). I tend to freeze during conversations. It is like my mind hits a speedbump for a second. People say I am extremely intelligent but I just feel slow most of the time. It is like I have trouble thinking sometimes. I do not really know how to explain it.

Throughout my entire life I have had difficulty relating to people my age. I do not have this problem emotionally and I am a very empathetic person, but I just do not connect sometimes. Speaking to adults has always been natural and easier for me. I do not know why.

I do not know if this is stereotypical or not but I have always been sensitive about eye contact. Maybe it is just because I am very submissive or it is due to something else.

I have been diagnosed with ocd, depression, social anxiety, and recently ptsd. I tend to get very over involved in things and I obsess about them. And this might not be appropriate or it might not matter but I have some pretty weird obsessions about fetishes and certain sexual topics.

Along with this mental illness runs strong in my family. My father had ocd and extreme anxiety, my mom had ADD along with my brother, my cousin has several disorders, my grandma has bipolar. It would not be a surprise if something else is off about me.

I do not mean to be insensitive or if I just sound like an idiot. I am just sort of confused a",3.3633248870772263,5.67234877635783,4.94327200616944,78.84549520766774,75.61341853035144,8.15110719400683,27.72601079651868,8.939507131559953,2.5253257463919803,1289,53,235,30,29,433,148,313,0.16,0.72,0.12,-0.8205,0,0,2,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,1,1,12,17,1,3,10,0,46,6,2,1,2,67,62,22,0,5,28,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,2,14,15,0,0,10,0,0,1,12,8,2,1,9,9,41,9,30,44,2,13,0,1,1,0,16,5,0,15,11,184,55,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25627450904929466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15707565974792334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06258314173461031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08842452263581096,0.10420199912046238,0.0,0.0,0.11766206443042655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1715255264012709,0.11548340365657385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09678266826551872,0.0,0.1038202056633327,0.07334332301184532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10727561148467454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196695541147712,0.0,0.1053630849759444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11589538233961533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1692646736848299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07251475864205087,0.2006261639837245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031399851199524,0.11183140782032476,0.0,0.0,0.10346136392736256,0.3267314681060846,0.10366157292587448,0.12023906698801627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918095794803125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2846977109154265,0.08964241707543981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444639702442746,0.0,0.0982357716430134,0.1200089526307642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06576931361027058,0.0,0.1013685092600712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16328538054723155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115981320663946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465322026513768,0.08698704115205026,0.1580718294875661,0.2030750323473499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06820553080257298,0.06578307218410792,0.0,0.0,0.11972863801268267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42354357288169225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18461488556199604,0.0,0.09263846960248344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07292970012994472,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,hyperactivemass,2019/04/16,"I'm really frustrated with my therapist (19AFAB) She doesn't think I have it and doesn't want to test me because I'm ""too smart"" and too empathetic yet other healthcare providers have suggested I might have it and even my family suspects I have it. I know it in my gut because it just fits too well and the only person who has ever completely gotten me is my partner who is also autistic. Should I give up on a official diagnosis or search for someone who can recognize it in me? She's a good therapist for everything else such as PTSD and depression but not this. She was an autism expert but mentioned some questionable practices.",5.906714876033059,6.928667636363637,6.5947004132231415,74.72114152892563,66.85123966942149,10.67809917355372,33.30681818181819,10.686352973137794,3.7916685950413225,508,22,91,14,8,167,82,121,0.08800000000000001,0.851,0.061,-0.478,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,10,5,1,0,4,0,13,1,1,0,1,20,20,10,0,2,5,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,11,6,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,2,1,0,2,0,15,3,9,16,1,7,0,1,0,0,12,5,0,4,2,72,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16778520131573646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25579679280869344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21998208179297865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807092826355452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1752695627055881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385777080353505,0.18978540582933748,0.0,0.0,0.18856394675081412,0.0,0.19779045487018285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2012691341400426,0.0,0.1759789044993232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11530624026513947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22257554599828144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15957016874136404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831982395894617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24525698407294125,0.0,0.2350355256181621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344098348248345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1777715653599636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4872118013835674,0.0,0.13443795261313715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375153633973685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18864463465161235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,floof_overdrive,2019/04/16,"I'm sick of autism publications blindly assuming that all autistic behavior is disordered Here's an example:

[‘Mind blindness’ affects moral reasoning in autism](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/mind-blindness-affects-moral-reasoning-in-autism/)

Short summary of the article: Autistics are more likely to hold others responsible for negligence than neurotypicals.

Because researchers have a great bias towards discounting the value of autistic behavior, this is spun into a negative headline. It would be no more objective to write a headline like ""Neurotypicals think it's OK as long as you didn't mean it.""

Not to mention that the term *mind blindness* shows a spectacular deficit of self-awareness, as allistics are at least as blind to our minds as we are to theirs.",18.22774193548387,13.402713064516135,14.580645161290324,45.74096774193549,47.38709677419354,18.851612903225806,61.645161290322584,15.903189008614273,9.188683870967742,636,38,84,20,4,190,88,124,0.127,0.76,0.113,-0.1943,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,2,1,1,0,1,4,0,0,8,1,9,5,0,2,1,15,12,5,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,5,0,0,0,7,2,0,1,4,1,1,0,4,0,0,0,1,4,4,4,20,9,5,7,1,0,4,0,7,5,0,1,4,56,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12143795733230894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283145326983719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21963224282364924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19465011556080564,0.0,0.0,0.176296599631418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170005748334968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8045904581367856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048234033840943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20782185542111248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276471856743489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14151468857531718,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Thatrandomberryguy,2019/04/16,"My personal experience with many autistic guys, please for the love of god stop worshipping women. Have some respect for yourselves. You are just as valuable if not more valuable! I am going to anger quite a lot of people by writing this post. So be it, can't do anything about it.  
This post is only aimed towards a group of autistic guys on here that seriously grinds my gears.  


**Stop worshipping women like they are some holy creature that can't do any wrong, including autistic women.**  


Many males on here are some serious white knights. You think women are perfect beings and that sex is the ultimate goal of life. I can understand that being alone and all those raging hormones make you crave the magick cave. But for the love of god please contain it and try to act rationally! There is a nice cute looking autistic girl on here, and you flock to her like a pack of wolves onto a lone sheep. She is not special guys, just an ordinary human but with boobs and other genitals...  


Relationships really aren't that special, even for normal people not on the spectrum. Dating in todays world infested with feminism and fat acceptance is often absolutely not worth it! Many females have enormous egos that are big enough to fill the void of space. Look at Japans herbivore men, the declining birth rate, marriage companies dying, marriage rates plummeting, infidelity of female partners rising.   


Slowly men are realizing the game is not worth the effort. Groups like MGTOW are growing in numbers extremely quickly. Many of these guys are normal everyday people, and it doesn't matter if you have autism or not. Females expect to be treated special and you have to pander to there whims and every single need. Very often females will discard you just for being autistic, for not looking hot enough, for not being rich enough, no friends or social status. See the many studies performed on this topic by datingsites.  


I have seen how my best friend, who is autistic aswell, got destroyed and used by women. They used him as an emotional tampon and threw him away after they had used him. She did horrible stuff to him, gossiping behind his back, telling lies about him, putting his friends against him, berating and destroying his image. I told him many times that he should stop clinging to girls and try to distance himself from loving her to much. Yet every time it ends the same, they end up using him and trying to hurt him. He eventually learned that women in todays society can be toxic as hell.   


Just because a girl is autistic, does not mean she is any different. Keep that in mind! In my life I have met many autistic girls that would make a hooker blush. Some of these girls would have a new partner every day and cheat around like it's natural. Most where very rude and had no perception of decency or loyalty. They blame everyone else for not trusting or liking them and completely forget about any self-improvement or respect. Autism is not an excuse to justify being a massive slut and cheating... Yes, you have problems, but: that does not mean you should treat your fellow humans like trash.   
   
Sex is really not that great guys. If you really want it that bad, go pay yourself a hooker. After that experience you will understand that it was not like you imagined it to be. Without connection or true love sex will feel just like masturbation on yourself but worse. Stop putting effort into females and dating, just be yourself. Focus on your hobbies and what makes you happy. If a girl really likes you, she will take you for whom you are. Don't try to act like someone you are not just for 15 minutes of pleasure.   


Improve yourself, invest times in hobbies and loved ones, treat the ones you care about with respect. But DO NOT give respect to someone just because she has this magick cave in her pants. Respect is to be earned not to be given. And if you treat people well and are a good person, you have earned respect, don't forget that. You are to be treated with respect and decency by these women.  


Take care of yourselves guys. Have fun and enjoy life. Do what makes you happy. Treat these women like you would treat your male friends. They are no different, ordinary humans like the rest of us.

autism,OFFascist,2019/04/16,"Texas bill to criminalize sexual abuse of ""disabled individuals."" This bill is likely well meaning but the way I read it it would treat disabled people like children.

&gt; (2)  ""Disabled individual"" has the meaning assigned by Section 22.04(c).

https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm#22.04

&gt;(3) ""Disabled individual"" means a person:

&gt;(A) with one or more of the following:
&gt;(i) autism spectrum disorder
&gt;(ii) developmental disability
&gt;(iii) intellectual disability
&gt;(iv) severe emotional 
&gt;(v) traumatic brain injury
&gt;(vi) mental illness,

The bill is currently pending in the Criminal Jurisprudence Committee.

autism,Magea,2019/04/16,"[School Project] Autism and South-America/Asia // Help ! Dear Reddit community,

I, and 8 other colleagues, are working on a school project where we want to draw the most accurate and up-to-date map of autism awareness, autism diagnostic techniques, autism structures and patient pathways for South-America and Asia.

We are looking for any kind of quantitative as much as qualitative data, and as you can guess, for instance, to perform interviews.

We are as much interested as interviewing doctors and nurses as people who simply have somebody in their family going through this disease.

If you would have any suggestion of places to contact, people to connect with, it would be very useful to us.  


Additionally, we are totally open to share with you the output of our work and progress, as for us it is important to give back. For instance, we have done so far a couple of interviews of key players as well as a pretty detailed scientific literature analysis of autism in South America.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great day, and thank you for your attention!",11.683461538461534,10.03643006593407,10.46381868131868,60.56243131868132,56.03296703296704,13.715384615384615,46.37637362637364,12.38480682065935,5.8901186813186825,840,43,130,21,8,265,110,182,0.0,0.8340000000000001,0.166,0.9818,0,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,8,5,1,4,4,7,0,0,6,0,14,1,0,1,1,27,21,20,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,5,18,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,15,7,35,17,4,12,0,0,1,0,23,9,0,3,2,93,20,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16969604476654973,0.19030858150358868,0.21301185798668928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12042993449824868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17329535603679366,0.0,0.10100595521066076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1603056386069719,0.0,0.16027506965087138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14764595305076547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502427058439854,0.08900988470295662,0.0,0.0,0.17267241400697605,0.17253289994932255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10497805780090863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16309403344107354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13152006784625642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23026518963076364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21715905137147007,0.0,0.16363296463698246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593372874271579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3170125023837721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1441932430841682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37678546643454336,0.13526807049187115,0.0,0.12922663860658054,0.09237763033797096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408188119559736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280402202072649,0.0,0.0,0.22251453228901144,0.0,0.19030858150358868,0.0
autism,CareBearEmptyStare,2019/04/17,"Puzzle piece at work My boss meant well, and I appreciate it so much. They wanted to do something for me, their token autistic, for Autism Acceptance Month. They didn't ask me how they can honor this month. They just put up some primary colored puzzle pieces on the website. Why didn't they consult me on something I know more a out than they do? It's so incredibly offensive, but if I am honest with them I seem like an ungrateful asshole. If I say nothing, they never learn how to show their support properly and LISTEN TO ACTUALLY AUTISTIC PEOPLE regarding issues that affect us. The primary colored puzzle pieces are so infantilizing.

autism,kuleneko,2019/04/17,"Stepmom says Pills will stop me rocking back and forth At dinner tonight, I was unconsciously rocking back and forth, and my Stepmom asked me if i needed a tranquilizer. She said that the therapist I'm about to go to for the first time will give me pills that will make me stop fidgeting. Is this actually a thing? Because the only pill I could find that is FDA approved for autism is risperidone, which I already know turns me into a drooling houseplant. She was adamant that it would/ needed to happen, and acted like rocking back and forth was the worst thing in the world.",6.389007936507938,7.379754805555558,5.614179894179895,82.29166666666669,65.75925925925927,8.023280423280424,32.09523809523809,7.957251820313856,2.188546031746032,461,18,85,5,7,139,66,108,0.08800000000000001,0.863,0.049,-0.5106,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,2,4,3,0,0,8,0,11,5,1,1,0,16,22,6,0,5,1,0,0,1,0,4,3,2,0,0,9,6,1,2,2,3,0,2,0,1,0,1,4,3,12,2,9,13,1,14,0,0,0,0,6,4,0,1,9,60,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.1906601903561784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21560385487088576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18265152515211625,0.0,0.0,0.4506995564454254,0.0,0.11910026928033735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15599298165640396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17857143352862126,0.16618794407510376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1874238360121045,0.11103749723029313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17277161810712738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10737432721099124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954515445088636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041595316680815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28973978081051965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14859334128101262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18584867906481176,0.15537197601221328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32668856358991644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268482575727159,0.25960016898615884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392615193679627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21251454226116634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387905222279227,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,malhimoo,2019/04/17,"The ‘look’ I have so many clear memories of the look on kids faces when I said the ‘wrong’ thing. I tried so hard to follow the rules but I didn’t know what they were. I was lucky, I had friends, but I also had kids that didn’t like me or who avoided me because of stuff I’d said when I let myself show through.

I remember actually repeating social rules that I’d figured out to myself in my head. ‘Don’t be too loud’, ‘Don’t talk about anything unless someone else brings it up first’. The list went on.

Even as a 47 year old it still happens to me. It’s not as often - I’m an expert at mirroring who I’m with and the list of rules in my head is a long one. But every once in a while the wall comes down and I mess up.

autism,Fuck_My_Life_69,2019/04/17,"Taking notes in class Sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile, and sorry for my English, it is not my native language.

I really struggle with taking notes during classes, and while I don't really need to at the moment because school is really easy. I'm afraid that next school year things will get a lot more difficult and I will have to take notes to keep up with te information.

The problem is that I just can't do it, I can't pay attention to what is said and take notes at the same time, not without copying the entire sentence (I can't write fast enough to keep up that way, I write very slow). I just don't know what the vital information is in what is said, I never had to pay attention in class or take notes, thus I never learned how to do something like that. 

Tl;DR Does anyone have any tips on how to figure out what the important information is, I've watched tons of YouTube videos but none of the tips work.

Also on a side note, how would one study for tests, I don't know how to do that either.",8.155571815718158,5.616544643902444,8.086504065040653,77.65604336043363,63.536585365853654,11.257452574525747,33.021680216802174,9.444778638647367,2.636517615176152,792,21,167,11,9,257,106,205,0.041,0.905,0.054000000000000006,0.1153,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,1,7,6,0,2,10,0,22,0,0,5,2,40,37,12,0,3,8,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,0,0,12,7,0,2,9,1,2,0,12,4,0,1,3,3,13,2,28,31,7,22,0,0,1,0,7,12,0,2,10,111,25,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11138646191413994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471882946994883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09739157086558707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490707016028237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121889567936317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14391902292350486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07277085824040062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24760647737137514,0.0,0.0,0.1530951959891476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06804779733490827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11841544264618065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10327833868955442,0.2148509315930948,0.0,0.14813157361011708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09438337301123766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133277290400556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676893283233456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2649845701928555,0.0,0.0,0.28192846573834024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10722868447208786,0.0,0.3118371416800179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14561131323533769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5236263284944759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09253501228383837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08121842069743768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492501930025208,0.0,0.11055824533950127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13426612849704178,0.0,0.10140140992268716,0.0,0.0,0.09894433219668608,0.0,0.0,0.08969521311753043

autism,DMBear89,2019/04/17,"Employment I just got offered a new job today working in an office dealing with peoples insurance claims. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past I have been discriminated against from securing a job because of my autism, it got to the point that on application forms I wouldn't even say I am disabled or having learning difficulties cause I didn't want to be treated any differently.    


I had my interview for this new job today and I mentioned I am recently diagnosed as being autistic. They asked me if I needed any extra support or anything to make sure I'm fine working for them and I said I would need extra support on the I.T. systems AT FIRST and once I'm comfortable with it I'll be fine on my own. For this job you had to pass a data assignment like spot mistakes e.g. wrong spelling, wrong address, wrong postcode etc and i got 38/40 right. Since I'll be working with peoples data attention to detail is paramount in this job and I think mine will benefit me greatly in the role.

&amp;#x200B;

What the company did is that because they are introducing new systems between now and July they are pushing my start date back till July when the new systems are in place and then I can come in and get started with them. I hate being thrown in at the deep end especially working with I.T. systems  and then a new system gets brought in and i end up messing up and losing my job (which has happened) so I thought it was quite considerate of this company to push the start date back that way come July and everything is in place at there end I should have full training on the new systems. Start date was the 29th of this month, i'm not fussed, July is better as it gives me time to prepare more for going back into work.",5.183367588932807,6.404800915151519,5.63171277997365,80.24104743083005,68.63636363636364,8.163372859025033,32.83267457180501,8.456263369488248,2.6069868247694328,1362,61,251,20,23,437,172,330,0.065,0.8490000000000001,0.086,0.7159,8,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,5,9,11,19,1,0,15,0,30,1,0,2,1,40,59,22,0,8,5,0,0,1,0,4,1,2,1,0,14,20,0,1,5,0,0,7,3,7,0,1,13,2,33,12,44,37,7,70,0,1,0,0,15,25,0,3,32,171,47,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15777133295814175,0.1769354059990023,0.09902165020016708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059913435209462136,0.0,0.06806412350033288,0.0,0.0,0.1679508027425374,0.0,0.0887641691518157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06439131363862997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07479219268922027,0.0,0.12543247413016276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07506016579763437,0.0,0.07389692830626048,0.0,0.07606715578487698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934544889772894,0.0,0.08119834290047888,0.04808791768519286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06543366662865523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061929057205374324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607664188600523,0.06984249986749269,0.04137753527300878,0.0,0.17468970416507448,0.08026927486865851,0.0,0.0,0.0643824284653646,0.0,0.0,0.07188121267167574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4334945006431256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03556951253671773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0814516997214818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048598814246782716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05811334623898087,0.0,0.0,0.1079699948173036,0.0,0.42190104825798425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07753640299486593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950191397423534,0.1009495331665974,0.0,0.15213431156975396,0.0,0.06882554838808674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774385315021587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188750239469248,0.0,0.0,0.062176238233618536,0.06925552597333193,0.057898543989592925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060226177808678526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20613088061403428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16523960129431664,0.06861913774968338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04665137914806073,0.0,0.057800121567665,0.04245397715067449,0.0,0.13802384272479953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04294308065337145,0.05779030398715854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2650195056082735,0.0,0.0,0.05171955305453728,0.23880699364922384,0.1769354059990023,0.0
autism,seth3511,2019/04/17,"Lost for what to do Alright, so it's pretty likely that im on the spectrum. I have all kinds of trouble socializing with people, very limited interests, etc. Now, a diagnosis would be nice, since it would open the door to some resources, but I dont know if its necessary. Really, I just want to treat the presenting issues, regardless of what is causing them. I just want to be able to interact with people on more than the most basic level, so I can have some quality of life. But I dont know where to start. What sort of provider should I seek out? Psychologist, psychiatrist, or what? Or should I first start by finding a primary care doctor and ask for a referral?",4.868759689922481,6.019013085271318,6.007751937984494,77.51922480620159,69.31007751937986,10.074418604651164,29.837209302325586,10.25414643259724,3.0721534883720936,524,20,101,14,9,175,85,129,0.04,0.8079999999999999,0.152,0.9232,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,3,6,9,0,0,7,1,13,2,0,1,1,29,22,8,0,8,7,0,0,1,0,4,2,0,1,0,8,5,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,9,7,19,15,6,11,0,1,0,0,4,6,0,7,6,75,17,1,0.17967061640348336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16796777258687115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18318616784222594,0.1845712155954665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1839004891848569,0.0,0.0,0.4211452486159105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20038023107241976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642156883851211,0.15282773452802606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19407509734833295,0.18752944363361415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870992985248643,0.19748454396560625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269066698571689,0.08777798766135654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19613170202456426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24912196554760474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18278960963490465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11510159759714195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14862539055388124,0.0,0.0,0.1831515669690959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543435740999461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14824707516202934,0.2119487693198572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25526570178242725,0.0,0.0,0.0

1.i have like 3 friends 
2.autism USUALLY gets diagnosed around 2 or three, all those 25 year olds getting diagnosed don’t mean anything

autism,farfromtheash,2019/04/18,"Keychain Fidget/Stim Toy Recommendations? I work with three boys with developmental disabilities. One of them seems to struggle with the bus ride from home to school, so I thought I'd get some fidgets to help him have a smooth transition between places. They all like the toys, but the child I'm talking about also likes throwing them. It's not a mean-spirited behavior at all, but it is unsafe, so I'm looking for keychain-bound toys I can attach to his backpack to make them non-projectile.

He likes lights and buttons. He seems curious about things with multiple moving elements. Not a fan of plushy things. Squishy-rubbery seems okay (like a slime-filled stress ball). I'm currently looking at the [Simpl Dimpl](https://www.amzn.com/B07KLY7PPP), and keychain flashlights. It'd be nice to get/make an assortment of things for him, see what he likes, and anything he doesn't like will go in the bag for the other kids!",7.1118400876232215,8.449977084337352,6.0050930996714165,78.88760679079958,64.3012048192771,9.168893756845565,33.76560788608982,9.339509955726095,3.0248265060240964,740,31,130,13,11,221,107,166,0.047,0.79,0.163,0.9609,1,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,4,1,5,10,0,2,11,1,7,0,0,1,2,19,20,8,0,0,4,0,1,6,0,1,0,0,1,3,8,7,0,0,4,4,0,4,3,2,0,2,1,5,10,8,23,16,3,9,0,0,3,0,16,4,0,4,7,73,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13109040302868605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348959369800512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712876227782669,0.0,0.09316209913625728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10987517016360247,0.0,0.16442968876168698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4805115284866629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753106722919556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10942090970113262,0.0,0.0,0.17856189055819885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1742258538701946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107951715700648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712662646889584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16590039563060438,0.13062664258631218,0.4476922599288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18777501763457072,0.17136953099623958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13175634355446064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32671256038018265,0.0,0.0,0.13013778177085153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193390243842068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,bloonsthecat,2019/04/18,"I might be on the spectrum, but what do I do now? I'm 17 years old, female, and currently a freshman in college. I've been going to CBT therapy for social anxiety since early fall of last year.

So, a story my mom always likes to tell people is how I learned to read when I was 3 years old, without any external help. I also hadn't learned any real social skills at that point outside of gibberish. Basically, I learned to talk after I learned to read, and even then I didn't really talk much. When I entered school, my mom says that my friend would talk for me and lead me around. My mom didn't see any concern with it though.

I recently learned about Hyperlexia, which basically describes that to a T. Precocious reading skills far earlier than expected without training and underdeveloped social skills. I brought this up to my therapist, who I've talked to about the prior things before, and she felt it was pretty accurate as well. She also commented on how it's not a sole-diagnosis and mentioned ASD. But she didn't say anything specific on it. I know a therapist can't diagnose autism, so I assume she couldn't make any conclusions. However, it stuck in my head, and before I knew it I was heavily researching the possibilities and talking about it with my mom and my friend and BF. I brought it up to a HS teacher of mine who I keep in contact with, and he said that he had figured that was the case since he first taught me. He elaborated why, and as I continued to research more on autism and how it presents, he might be correct. 

I assume it would be level 1/high-functioning? But I'm not officially diagnosed, and I'm always scared to self-diagnose myself. Everything seems really accurate, especially when it comes to my social skills. But if it is the case, is it really worth it to get professionally diagnosed? I'm already in college, it's not like my childhood development can be aided at this point. Should I just keep it in mind to understand myself better, or is it a good idea to seek a diagnosis? I'm lost on what to do.",6.372626218376957,6.419175284634763,7.311008651845362,73.38977658525901,65.67506297229218,11.13608586135144,34.64122221005365,10.848893137575418,3.783662227576389,1616,69,307,42,23,544,193,397,0.044,0.8759999999999999,0.08,0.9501,2,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,0,9,19,9,0,1,13,0,29,4,1,5,1,63,52,34,0,6,12,4,1,2,3,5,3,3,0,0,30,19,0,2,15,3,1,7,11,2,1,1,18,5,40,7,48,24,2,46,0,1,1,0,35,19,0,7,22,202,70,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08404390861525557,0.12180945874645326,0.1267416198822374,0.0,0.0,0.20716430260125585,0.0,0.05826181357553679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06267278416651154,0.06779810702691312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12961226026046094,0.0,0.0,0.0673568939548081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0656046707315967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.309201181478909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050302635386613496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844725313285857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312506909422031,0.0,0.0,0.06478123683442212,0.0,0.0,0.11768129071297002,0.0,0.0397901984785676,0.0,0.04328320231416051,0.06387898020731428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07816162509790851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051048111448608983,0.08046669945768536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08597481202335673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13538813636962452,0.0,0.0,0.041855272713696184,0.062080162203412476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07441537526026124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313709732615059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05083706159375706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16158640080079678,0.07689939035043977,0.35678837149407033,0.0,0.0,0.055985999880560564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15983318012263315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05279941203288797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439907000554402,0.08585839975534952,0.0,0.07748159736319864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22854034730927994,0.08668619118137341,0.14636918901510165,0.0,0.07519832415051718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244513048684913,0.12113019186194005,0.07624895156500118,0.07707748595892362,0.060689265818426125,0.06933275384388778,0.07945097445171963,0.0,0.0,0.1259998606249552,0.0,0.0,0.31054010119464864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3060706299619166,0.06656676504529452,0.0,0.08709503239295988,0.1768541127466249,0.05059699162578337,0.0,0.0748263278892105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928473157803907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06847654221630141,0.0,0.06872210824470884,0.0,0.0,0.14683009190841562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820305577349174,0.0,0.0,0.1471326744862769
autism,Nirokogaseru,2019/04/18,"Is self diagnosis legitimate? I’ll be up front and honest, I’m officially diagnosed and biased biased against self diagnosis, but I’m also looking for honest discussion on the issue given how many are taking the “Aspietest” and sharing their results.

The Pro-Self Diagnosis argument as I understand it:

(This is not my view, but I will do my best to write an honest argument from their perspective)

Diagnosis and referrals of diagnosis are incredibly hard to the obtain in even the most aware countries, so If you don’t meet all the classic stereotypes or are severely impaired by it, diagnosis is essentially impossible in most settings. The scarcity of diagnosis should not prevent those who know they’re autistic from participating in the community and identifying as an autistic.

The Official Diagnosis is the only valid Diagnosis Argument from my perspective:

One of the things I see a lot in mobile gaming, which I might be a little to into, is something called confirmation bias. Confirmation Bias is when you hold a view or hypothesis, and then you pay attention primarily to the data that confirms your theory.

A cardinal truth I find to be true is that every person has massive blind spots— we are less likely to see our own faults and more likely to exaggerate a small fault that no one else would even notice. A diagnosis provides checks and balances that are crucial because no human being, no matter how aware or trained, is able to assess their own psychological state with an acceptable reliability.


Instead of writing an entire essay, I want to flesh this out more in the comments.

I was tested for autism when I was in elementary school and tested negative, but my I’ve started to become suspect again my girlfriend and I talked about it. Apparently she always thought I was on the spectrum. I started taking some tests online. They all indicated that I could be on it, but I assumed I shouldn’t take most of them too seriously.

I took the quiz that a lot of people in this sub have been posting ([yes, this one](https://rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php)) and I’m pretty sure I got [rather extreme results for someone who tested negative.](https://imgur.com/a/oCcAJF1)

What do you all recommend I do with this info? Should I get retested?",4.184609164420486,6.481697905660379,4.943688230008989,79.84712264150946,73.0880503144654,7.3101527403414215,28.96720575022462,8.192908349453996,2.1992601976639707,673,28,119,11,14,217,96,159,0.069,0.843,0.08800000000000001,0.7013,1,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,1,2,0,6,3,0,0,5,1,12,0,0,1,3,29,26,10,0,5,9,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,12,4,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,1,0,0,8,0,19,2,15,14,5,14,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,7,5,84,31,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1752982997601735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2326737505908953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16820667482001098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11006888103361376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16849587283618747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17910817028029893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14275868811668854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14605537101864466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2017682102526804,0.21433199754100052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21321413204190198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17850406353356305,0.0,0.0,0.2358331760775115,0.2982333974422429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985584937073424,0.0,0.31680244235530475,0.16933241373655086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16725224843895378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4681348806317101,0.14303435145619833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16722383997943152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,ofbalance,2019/04/18,"I Think my Daughter's Education and Healthcare Plan will be Derailed by a Certain Physician. (UK) I've just received a letter asking my youngest daughter, M, to attend an appointment with a developmental paediatrician for her EHCP.

It is vital that M receives an Education and Healthcare Plan! Without one to one with her hlta she will absolutely be permanently excluded from school. Her hlta funding needs to be permanent!

The problem is that my eldest daughter, L, attended a similar appointment with that same developmental paediatrician. 

At the end of the meeting the DP  used a finger to draw a 'line' in the air and said, ""This is the line between normal and sub-normal. Your daughter is above this line.""

I was not impressed. My complaints at the language used were heard, but that's about it.

L has been diagnosed as autistic, and has been home schooled for two years because she could not cope with a school environment.

I do not want that DP anywhere near M. 

M has so many more complex needs than L. And I really can't home school two children. 

M needs her Education and Healthcare Plan to enable her to access specialist secondary education. She would not survive in a typical secondary school.

I am going to ask for another appointment date, in hope that M will be seen by another DP.

If there is not another DP, what do we do? It's always one battle after another!",5.797932480603901,7.704367031872515,6.486408052002517,72.08767037114703,67.92430278884463,9.427636821136508,35.12287691339903,9.811843763644266,3.7961107569721113,1099,55,183,26,19,360,134,251,0.054000000000000006,0.91,0.036000000000000004,-0.4834,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,1,1,0,5,4,6,1,0,17,0,26,3,1,2,1,36,40,11,0,10,9,4,1,0,0,4,2,2,2,1,12,12,0,0,2,0,1,5,7,2,0,5,7,4,19,4,30,24,2,16,0,0,1,0,23,7,0,2,4,128,31,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09406252129865277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4741502846015128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2113636872866441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06891120140102662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025725836747377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147383264686543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012434355913744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06424609600749168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267867656183798,0.11227922244761901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11460991789811675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514643733801281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076012824461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2298067150665179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081688272088328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07241954127876858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10753171114168388,0.0,0.0,0.5720380307111692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243469104316867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22085713760016468,0.0,0.0,0.1952692214481711,0.0,0.0,0.066676887937152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897137546649034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030394631006123,0.0,0.0,0.07279729337241317

autism,throwaway123091484,2019/04/19,"I believe my girlfriend may be autistic My SO of nearly two years is the love of my life, extremely extremely intelligent, has a great sense of humor, beautiful and just awesome. I was having a conversation with a friend of mine (20) who just got diagnosed with highly functional autism (I'm really sorry if this is the wrong/offensive wording) and after we hung out I couldn't get these thoughts of my girlfriend out of my head - so much of what he was saying made something click in my head.

Just to name a few she :

* Has trouble expressing how she's feeling and in turn represses a lot
* Struggles with eye contact
* Finds it very hard to make decisions day to day
* Trouble reading body language (from my experience)
* Very few close friendships
* I was reading a post on masking on this subreddit and it really really hit home extremely hard

I really really don't want to armchair diagnose her, but looking back across a whole different number of situations it really does make a lot of sense to me. There's just a plethora of examples - I literally just remember as I was writing this that she told me once that she used to be really uncomfortable with people touching her. She has been diagnosed with social anxiety and depression and has been in therapy for years - and is much better nowadays.

I'm really struggling to actually decide what to do in this situation. I'd really like to talk to her about it but do not want to make her upset by doing so as I could easily be completely wrong. I just want her to get the help and resources such as a different therapeutic approach or support from her family that she needs if she does in fact need. I really want to see her thrive. Again, I will stress that if diagnosed it would be as extremely functional (again, sorry if this is offensive) - which the main problem why I'm not actually sure all things considered.

How do you think that I should bring this up with her in the best way possible and has anyone on here had any similar experiences or general advice?

autism,Ivory_Beetle,2019/04/19,"I'm in dire need of some help, or support (sorry about long post) Heyo,

I'm very new to reddit but heard it was a friendly place, so here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to ask for advice for me. Not a diagnosis.

I pretty much want to ask you guys if you've experienced these issues that I'm having, and how to deal with them if you have had them.

Here's some quick background info real quick:

I've never been professionally to see a doctor about whether I'm on the spectrum, I'm 18, I'm a woman and I take a low percentage script for depression/anxiety (not sure if those come into it).

&amp;#x200B;

Here we go!

Since I was a kid I've had issues with touch. I like feeling very secure when it comes to being touched. I like heavy blankets, being held tightly. When I was a child and my mom was holding my hands I would want her to squeeze it as tight as possible otherwise I'd feel anger. I still like feeling weight put onto me, like a heavy duvet. I also have a special 'skin brush' (?), where my mom would brush my arms slowly, backwards and forwards, not disconnecting the brush from my arm until it was done; she would have to brush my whole arm, down my hand, and finally end at my fingertips. (I hope that makes sense). If I feel a disconnection in my skin (especially my arms or fingertips), I would have to touch the areas which 'weren't complete' to feel grounded.  I'm also very much aware of sounds, light and smell, and that becomes a problem if my 'safe space' (usually my room) is being intruded with large amounts of these.

It's so difficult to explain, but I get obsessive over small acts. Very small acts. If I'm watching something on my computer, I have to make sure the mouse curser touches the 4 edges and 4 sides of the screen and I keep going until i feel like 'it's' complete.

I've only just realised I am not good in socializing. I end up embarrassing myself at social gatherings where I don't know people. I understand that it's normal to feel nervous around new people, especially in large groups. But I went to uni for around a month, made a good, small group of friends, but no matter how hard I tried I could not socialize with anyone outside that group. I much preferred being quieter, or in my room, or just away from people. I've always had a very small group of friends, and they are usually people I trust, but I'm also very good at just expelling people from my life whenever I feel like it. Which may not be very nice, but I feel no guilt.

Last, and probably most important is overload. I feel copious amount of overload, like my head is being pushed to limit with sounds, and things. I feel anger, and my feet and hands start to feel dirty (?). Like, I have to go sower, or clean at least my feet, then go sit in my room and cry, or just sit in silence. Switch off all my lights, and make my bed, and clean my room and just sit in silence to calm myself. I feel so much anger and stress, and I feel overwhelmingly sad when I feel overloaded with senses. It's usually at home, in the afternoon/evening. It rarely happens outside anymore. But when it does happen outside I go completely blank instead, and I usually just walk for hours, with nothing in my head. It has taken me down some pretty dangerous places, but because I don't feel anything I don't sense danger.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so sorry this is a long post. I don't know what's wrong with my brain to make these issues so prominent in everyday life.  I thought they were normal until other people started noticing how stressed I'd become in certain surroundings. I hope any of you can understand or help, and I hope that if you're feeling the same as me you know you're not alone. It sucks, but I wanna know what it's all about!

Thanks guys!",4.689823646850048,5.461193266304349,5.226383096716951,84.34499223602485,69.46195652173913,8.23642413487134,28.06388642413487,8.354732019191555,1.7802981144631769,2908,96,591,41,49,933,305,736,0.128,0.7120000000000001,0.16,0.9695,1,1,1,0,0,0,117.0,1,4,4,1,37,46,6,7,23,0,44,18,14,8,6,144,115,68,0,23,37,2,31,8,3,5,3,3,8,5,32,36,1,8,27,0,0,14,15,18,0,0,18,45,84,28,82,85,15,96,0,3,3,0,36,49,1,22,38,366,116,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04789913473590792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05076713622589296,0.0,0.11759734266165785,0.0407863172974352,0.15933066050623682,0.17868414100449806,0.033333442425809164,0.0,0.037498097578740085,0.0,0.04861198668702468,0.034274033350856964,0.0,0.0403370583917755,0.08727157213027519,0.09164911056825358,0.0,0.046053363517275306,0.0,0.0,0.029880488922531024,0.10827150555787184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054719513774129466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08444812111882019,0.15418110804273585,0.0,0.0,0.03913632260062647,0.0,0.05384319841901733,0.0,0.05053468024476357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05017127990472696,0.04289536640020487,0.050161712657646684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08682955100968319,0.0,0.0,0.032375461978187116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4213385036902236,0.0700359326826533,0.0,0.05369605225822035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361192481484746,0.0,0.025609514254002798,0.0,0.1392882957370063,0.12334014782797847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706965984608412,0.08669166664646788,0.0,0.043909869594990505,0.0,0.10061177519077152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06571052107152679,0.0,0.0491683449139205,0.1460557062291978,0.04827216317023687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15348396704038536,0.0,0.04356882524786025,0.0,0.0,0.1077544967506444,0.03995563881631409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0692447321201045,0.1915790004888894,0.0,0.0,0.0867575296569148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04638135104106296,0.13087770388661873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11481693023423148,0.03912513833313018,0.0,0.14413341142171945,0.03634570418370417,0.037805160803122385,0.09468242061587943,0.0,0.0,0.09605308622646884,0.047033417898315485,0.055806516834335455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03727986271515669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20389452881782474,0.0,0.10242528387376744,0.0,0.0,0.0552596367053771,0.09389004063542088,0.09973642494719076,0.05284893602761959,0.0469029327230471,0.0,0.04927592154877082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055792414553557934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0390604389389791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04054761411174188,0.0,0.0,0.1499008823542462,0.0,0.03773590953612455,0.0,0.10974170042628788,0.06938938936323302,0.0,0.039145276222198516,0.0,0.11229829482503184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05562424707196479,0.09239644351973764,0.0,0.036854906613992974,0.0,0.0,0.0451285408424274,0.0,0.0,0.032564913667070636,0.0,0.0,0.038914258055402134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03327952667485468,0.0,0.0,0.10205746847763253,0.0,0.0,0.21594250748663293,0.2831108212482454,0.05782334282058335,0.0,0.0,0.05968986167704225,0.0,0.045439524844842684,0.0,0.05472606092053983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13928192394669606,0.05359271874784104,0.17868414100449806,0.0
autism,thouartmorelovely,2019/04/19,"Which state is best for autistic kids? Today we went to visit a public school where we were going to enroll my son. When my son approached the school psychologist/BCBA in a friendly manner b/c she reminded him of my daughter's teacher, she viewed it as a negative. Now if he did so to everyone, I would also be concerned. So she told me she was going to discourage him from acting that way in the future.

My state is heavily saturated with ABA, which I think sucks out the humanity in every child. Let's just say I haven't had a good experience with ABA therapy. IF YOU ARE A BCBA OR RBT, PLEASE DO NOT POST IN THIS THREAD. I ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SAY (bad therapists but you're not, etc.). 

I want to get away from this type of harsh therapy. I want my son to retain his individuality. But everywhere I go, this is the only option in our schools. If I were to move, what state would be a better fit? Or is everybody following the ABA cult? 

I encourage autistic adults to answer this post.",2.931584392550988,4.777385557788944,4.807454921667162,81.44498669819691,75.3316582914573,8.099438368312148,24.771208986107013,8.841846274778883,1.8663943836831207,782,26,156,17,17,267,123,199,0.07200000000000001,0.833,0.095,0.8219,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,3,2,0,2,8,8,1,0,11,0,18,0,0,0,0,25,30,12,0,7,10,4,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,4,10,5,0,2,3,0,0,9,4,3,0,0,7,3,27,5,25,18,2,28,0,1,1,0,28,9,1,6,4,110,37,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609605568621105,0.1166444935388359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13704062885216775,0.0,0.12178732507406095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15307147039995092,0.1290016532798433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626728806393127,0.0,0.0,0.12289366142613542,0.13937584421835356,0.0,0.14267944048157394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11269136810453638,0.0,0.07620602861397112,0.0,0.24868744667110976,0.1223407668130116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08016105051055579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491521213415816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550265009225197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11093339204401748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16011089667139042,0.0,0.0,0.2793878498539449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2319880578635183,0.0,0.4428554763537441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33360811377946026,0.16935514387704234,0.0,0.09346144220102116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13825858564915472,0.13937584421835356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720644629896523,0.11577718075028835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352140339791919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20723005864962607,0.0,0.0,0.0

Every interaction he has with others, he says something incredibly rude. A couple weeks ago I was on the elevator with him when a woman came in with us and he looked straight at her and said "" oh my God you're so short. Why are you so short. You are so tiny..."" And I felt so embarrassed and I told him not to say that and I talked to him for half hour when we got home. Then a few weeks ago he called a lady an elephant, ""you are so big like an elephant"". I was so embarrassed yet again. But today, he did something much worse. When speaking to an older woman he said "" you are so old, I thought you gonna die, why are you not dead"" and stuff like that. I feel horrible for the woman and she was genuinely hurt. I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm gonna take him outside anymore. I'm too embarrassed and afraid he will say rude things to others.",0.46079822616408006,2.5356257073170743,2.1465299334811507,96.26972838137472,84.60975609756099,5.6784922394678485,18.58647450110865,6.980632752743323,-0.010317073170731828,750,19,178,10,22,245,107,205,0.146,0.779,0.075,-0.9412,0,0,2,0,0,0,28.0,2,6,0,0,13,10,2,5,9,0,15,0,0,0,0,26,32,20,2,1,3,2,2,2,0,3,0,6,1,3,7,17,0,0,5,0,0,1,4,8,0,1,11,9,27,2,18,17,2,26,0,1,1,0,37,7,0,0,20,104,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359060776795245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319635440797016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358730273041082,0.15218954988898822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472325747081362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13809922657982535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11211199881136906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06728106039090928,0.0,0.1277621246680678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10642328436419578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918986689179195,0.0,0.13347385066049944,0.0,0.13104104905958106,0.0,0.14244756055806893,0.0,0.1437317485250836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0731283899858344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001651238062215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117400873147562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978172107733702,0.09866512897392553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4188842541524985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2531483089863314,0.3174530471990079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20487804349651004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15232622706469176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004742502752094,0.10695165000676676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840168265131186,0.08526191648417569,0.0,0.10563780166576953,0.0,0.0,0.1261289330147923,0.12714817265602715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600593795600198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21347152398645144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24013878331383084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13560339021784876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17137746177708305

autism,Chaibrary,2019/04/19,"What to do when there aren’t enough resources where you live? My 5 year old is autistic, issues and behaviors are severe, and totally nonverbal.  I work with her as much as I can on everything I can.  She’s on a waiting list for a full time day program at an autism center but the waiting list is years long.  Her preschool can’t handle her and the schools here are not equipped for her needs.  If I could afford to move I’d be leaving every member of my small support system.  

We’ve been in touch with every agency that provides “services” here.  It’s not enough.  It amounts to phone calls and meetings with case workers which is hard enough to deal with, and the most involved services we have access to are people who would come and give me tips.  I’m not devaluing that but I have been living and breathing and researching and working with everything I can soak up about autism for the last three years.  At some point it becomes frustrating because the stress of working these appointments and meetings into my life when I care for her full time versus what they actually accomplish is just... well, you get it.

I’m at a loss.  I’m good with her, I make it work, I just want more for her and I feel completely stuck because of our location.  Is anybody else in a similar situation?",4.766900584795319,6.181373627530366,4.810249662618084,85.01625618533517,69.80971659919028,7.918038686459737,29.91655420602789,8.344100000000001,2.1000438146648666,1014,40,196,15,18,315,145,247,0.068,0.852,0.08,0.615,2,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,2,2,1,7,10,7,1,1,10,0,21,2,1,1,1,40,36,18,0,5,9,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,12,20,0,2,1,0,0,2,5,3,1,1,3,3,27,4,31,30,11,29,0,1,0,0,21,15,0,3,11,138,39,11,0.0,0.0,0.1230987902754934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537929763156763,0.1393166384684607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12880759104458306,0.0,0.12861267765570306,0.0,0.0,0.10866227728737887,0.1322600597278127,0.0,0.0,0.10071608182860654,0.0,0.0,0.0813527369797678,0.130049392801985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10537750458114173,0.0,0.0,0.3910228236953733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125642856512549,0.0,0.2267410023262249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378242601808949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06590527064890159,0.12100925441636055,0.0,0.10580398289811267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11300065323822008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13166203632676138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282456605858316,0.0,0.1335687626692991,0.0,0.0,0.08909955819784597,0.0,0.0,0.2227757274183547,0.11163387200863016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842024023865098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13407159101291524,0.09273068785181247,0.09353451406355896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13236738439908358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745268114218313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924728225708785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12766492169663188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425073271135145,0.0,0.0,0.14179165122784038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14449804553979534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14314723120319325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14711169078309091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07440326709475023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341901323505893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3673386587283499,0.0,0.0,0.08960940066221655,0.0,0.0,0.24369867716387156

autism,MaxArdite,2019/04/19,"University Hi all,

I am 18 and hopefully going to university after the summer to study animal science (with the aim to go into animal behaviour and rehabilitation). I have autism and considerably struggle in social situations (along with panic attacks, anxiety, selective mutism, depression and agoraphobia). I am going to try to live in dorms but also at home when needed (I specifically chose a close university).

I was hoping some of you might have some experience and/or advice.

Thank you!",8.20662601626016,10.501356573170732,9.742439024390247,49.55601626016261,62.536585365853654,13.271544715447154,34.39837398373984,12.45797560212912,5.800920325203251,397,17,52,16,6,139,60,82,0.113,0.787,0.1,0.3602,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,2,0,0,2,7,1,2,3,0,6,0,0,0,1,18,13,7,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,9,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,1,0,7,3,14,11,3,11,0,1,0,0,4,5,0,5,3,40,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21041718407144336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1721986686786694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647262344937459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24496802992803995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854627085326848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21063325797341945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3671296083908572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21599272594969812,0.4277409267308378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901396123104576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22843023342212554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15966385968336738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526423992694374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420390219863774,0.0,0.21950098353349265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22510881351995649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19824617997114027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14619437968477272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,DarkStarletlol,2019/04/19,"Posting for Asperger's Brother - His Success My younger brother has Asperger's and Dyslexia. He wasn't diagnosed till he was 10, but my mother and I always knew he was different, not bad different, more what we'd call Quirky.

We had never even heard of Autism before, so when one of my brother's teachers mentioned that he thought my brother should get tested, it took a little while of our mother doing research at the local library for her to agree. 

Once it was confirmed, that same teacher took extra time to accommodate my brother's needs.

We saw change in just a few weeks. It was like night and day. Whereas before he was loud, disruptive and angry in class, he was now attentive, eager to learn, and a model student. All it took was one teacher taking a little extra time to help. 

As it was, we were told that the likely-hood of him being able to hold down any kind of job for a 'proper' length of time was not going to happen, that he'd probably never have any kind of romantic relationship with anyone, or be able to have 'real' friends, simply because he was too socially inept. 

Cut to now. He's just turned 24. He has a full time job as a tech analyst, and was recently promoted to the Supervisor of his team. He saved up his money well, and bought his own 3 bedroom house last year. He's just finished decorating and repairing it, and moved in officially last week. His fiancé moved in with him. He's planning to host his Dungeons and Dragons group there twice a month. He's the Dungeon Master for the group of 6 great friends. He has a bedroom that he's turned into a library, with more than 3,000 books. The wedding is this autumn, and their hoping to start trying for a baby by Christmas.

Not bad for someone who was supposed to never get anywhere in life.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother wanted to post this himself, but didn't have a reddit account. He asked me to do it for him.

All he wants if for others to see that they don't have to let what other say about them hold them back. He was worried for a long time that he'd not amount to anything. That he'd be living with our mum for the rest of his life, unable to do anything for himself, not even read. He's gone above and beyond what was expected for him, and has never given up on living his best life, just because of what a few doctor's have told him.",5.23777861616238,5.7767392231947525,5.76417716743379,81.804113785558,68.14660831509846,8.053995321813929,29.76299705727005,7.873277556716777,1.918659760054327,1823,64,350,20,29,589,225,457,0.027000000000000003,0.847,0.126,0.9939,4,0,0,0,0,0,57.0,6,0,4,6,16,15,1,0,21,0,41,5,0,0,6,55,67,23,0,7,13,9,0,1,2,1,5,3,2,0,24,21,0,2,4,3,3,7,12,3,1,3,30,5,37,12,63,28,14,53,0,0,2,0,74,16,0,3,29,239,61,13,0.1719457515427382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07153631978526248,0.09315157497919033,0.10446645426239966,0.1169290073201225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060114233708269516,0.0,0.1414967027921549,0.0,0.08037303336108931,0.0,0.0,0.06610783467926717,0.14356752035934633,0.10481653419768737,0.0,0.14631317015985926,0.0,0.09022322901712472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08778791850632829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094790296959487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055445392513976066,0.0,0.0,0.08726065919312179,0.0,0.1796467135744779,0.0,0.08799688133466649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135685472349738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13284486111204102,0.0,0.08983455838190055,0.0,0.04886036654656869,0.0,0.0,0.0947853990488482,0.0,0.0,0.07602553011483924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0576258063991054,0.0,0.0,0.08539046425038294,0.0,0.09920115570090383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.170629626741457,0.0,0.0,0.1790550405066301,0.0,0.1401587368010806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791309031676882,0.18217555403194471,0.042002004444196175,0.1723348148155476,0.15183124880443907,0.0760832896490354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06862272921162793,0.18275112220337664,0.0,0.06374779802611681,0.26523032741820984,0.0,0.0,0.08067971994910463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09155830684537863,0.11651489123638575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16467649978217372,0.0,0.0926933010502621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085996141252533,0.0978559544856538,0.0,0.0,0.08488784297921281,0.09230269412787176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06836908151195528,0.0,0.0,0.06850925104403185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08763852002936852,0.07284453864855406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060852043970938186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06464090312366537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825286009905407,0.25065737618918993,0.0,0.0,0.16430153417238805,0.2865570850030064,0.05836993924097885,0.18702760221299414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10141805922071392,0.0,0.1379245102797359,0.0,0.07729994024576749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08730962856852592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10446645426239966,0.05536371326530777

autism,ghosttowns42,2019/04/20,"Two year old son just diagnosed this week; I'm in search of some videos or documentaries that have (up to date) information about what autism is and how to handle it. As the title says, my 2.5 year old son was just diagnosed with autism as well as global developmental delay. I've been suspecting autism since before 18 months, have had him in our state's early intervention speech program (he babbles but he has no words), and have done a lot of reading about autism and the spectrum and sensory issues and the like.

My husband isn't a reader, and he seems a bit lost after our son's diagnosis. I think his only experience with the word ""autistic"" comes from the kinds of negative things said in school in the late 90's/early 00's. ""But he's smart,"" my husband protests. ""He's a good kid.""

I was looking for any kind of video or documentary or something that he can watch that really describes what autism is (better than I can) and what our current understanding of it is. There's a YouTube channel (""How To ADHD"") that helped him understand my ADHD diagnosis a year or so back, because she really breaks things down into understandable and relatable language. Are there any YouTube channels that are similar for autism / ASD?

Thanks in advance!",5.9744642857142845,7.349222017316017,6.02936958874459,77.54976866883119,66.92207792207793,9.238203463203462,30.454816017316016,9.516144504307137,2.7436686147186142,990,37,180,20,16,313,138,231,0.071,0.875,0.054000000000000006,-0.4482,1,0,1,0,0,0,37.0,3,0,0,3,11,10,1,0,12,0,17,2,0,2,0,34,28,20,0,0,8,5,0,1,0,0,2,3,0,1,13,12,0,1,7,5,0,2,3,2,1,1,7,5,14,8,28,21,3,27,0,1,2,0,23,9,0,7,15,112,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3084834669561406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17455345820030554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09868681366470773,0.0,0.07823588406376696,0.0,0.10920929894552377,0.0,0.0,0.11350776775546405,0.14011585136093582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055497502708418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2605281645006569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313380763647564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12554276927389252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764689438756604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602470865938938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13395534772038892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26729617607255113,0.0,0.0,0.14477498145008508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06270125176900686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077746698342842,0.0,0.1401000815371846,0.10911148888705716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024410877126416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2693459633270701,0.0,0.0,0.0976096149182118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12837639001257767,0.0,0.16443790618204246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220823075932315,0.10206243844367796,0.0,0.12988861067837326,0.0,0.11683742612061172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061655465187713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09880367925582673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11815975630348075,0.0,0.0,0.17052899079455305,0.08223615283775472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12537115200900048,0.4008245794952647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10294793734970996,0.0,0.11539456459794699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24794346152650154

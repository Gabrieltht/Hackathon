alcoholism,broncotate27,2019/01/01,"Been an alcoholic for past 3 years Like my title says I've been struggling with drinking for past few years.  My drink of choice is vodka. I occasionally drink beer as well. 

Long story short I quit smoking weed about a year and a half ago and before that I was slowly weaning myself off. However I've found myself drinking a lot more now. 

I usually drink a liter of alcohol every two days or a 2 liter every 4-5 days and crazy thing is, I don't get drunk when I drink 6-10 drinks a day. I usually drink to relax due to my depression and anxiety and my health problems make my anxiety worse. 

Along with some bad news about my little sister being sexually assaulted by a family member and not having a great relationship with my girlfriend, I feel like its very hard to quit at this point.

I have a great job as of recent and would hate for something to go wrong because of my addiction. I honestly feel like quitting weed was a bad decision because now I substituted a somewhat harmless habit with a dangerous one.

To make matters worse I spend a lot of money on alcohol even when I'm broke I either use my credit card or sell stuff for alcohol money.

There are some days where I can barely function because I'm so tired and antisocial. The thing that makes me feel normal is coming home and drinking until I fall asleep because honestly I'm more happy and fulfilled when I'm at work and don't even think of drinking then.

Anyone have any advice or experience with quitting heavy drinking? I would hate to put my life on a further hold because of my addiction. 

I would love to quit but I know I have to make some hard decisions about my personal life as well, like my relationships and coming to terms with my failed relationship with my mother throughout my entire childhood and young adulthood.",6.750100864553312,6.843577230547553,7.125203170028822,74.88065778097985,64.87896253602304,10.167665706051872,32.91195965417867,9.888512548439397,3.1366980979827086,1437,54,262,28,20,469,182,347,0.136,0.772,0.092,-0.9186,2,0,18,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,7,15,27,4,1,16,0,19,25,1,5,0,56,41,26,0,5,6,2,5,4,1,3,10,1,1,1,7,23,17,1,8,15,5,5,3,12,2,3,5,6,38,15,41,32,11,40,0,3,0,1,9,10,0,9,29,165,45,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696239822574013,0.0,0.056903388819867076,0.05161892985042967,0.2489281108034152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03959958453359145,0.0,0.08909425350970979,0.0,0.0,0.040716991172010525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724215212369583,0.17748766117186993,0.0,0.0495509273781888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10032298699393967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502186366361126,0.0,0.050154918011058466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6274943686194479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692303885341506,0.0,0.09812551603519462,0.0,0.0,0.05696182196216117,0.054895708193313936,0.0,0.08833116223395132,0.08320154279980058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06384810448841158,0.0,0.0,0.03042368416711707,0.0,0.033094443538821336,0.0,0.0,0.12840141238551755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06198877706110225,0.10432841412979828,0.11498358800585955,0.0,0.06189762358705481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058411189757228074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057786023185717086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032002645034704714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226160946919991,0.11379635994101163,0.05836350811296665,0.0,0.05153326328688008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09901309712949544,0.05255642481760284,0.0,0.15548057210579866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05705474788874985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03945933853954348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11117758236125576,0.0,0.05084571502013353,0.0,0.0,0.05504782269242027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05571991711847834,0.0,0.0585389890403377,0.0,0.30968315193476176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057496824628409986,0.1875573096479648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046308222140371474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04482964347152781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060876465004663365,0.06666141802344422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737316987037635,0.037312551920673585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06692882647043749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0568839550157416,0.0,0.0,0.05029353241426945,0.12826808390170408,0.0480472894594716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471466707396077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042393405055040086,0.0,0.11868624930714305,0.12409848608355716,0.06366727352458873,0.0,0.11249800680549094
alcoholism,noodlecanoodle,2019/01/01,"The ways in which alcoholism has negatively affected me Just looking to relate or have a discussion with others. Hoping this is a judgement-free sub. 

I have racked up $6,000 in credit card debt. I considered getting a third card to support my habit. 

I gained back the 70 pounds I worked so hard to lose. 

I destroyed my credit, going from 740 to around 560. 

I lost several friendships and I lied to so many people I love.

My apartment is so disgusting that I can’t even think about allowing another human inside. 

I was arrested for a DUI and lost my parents’  trust as well as causing a near $8,000 loss between us. 

I became pregnant and went through the process of an abortion after having sex while in a blackout. 

I’m sure there are so many more, but these are the most pertinent.

alcoholism,abouttenbagels,2019/01/01,"My Q relapsed this weekend My Q is a coworker of mine who I care about very much and consider a beloved friend. She relapsed on Sunday and ended up incoherently texting a group chat full of work colleagues, some of whom don't know about her alcoholism. I texted her back individually hoping to prevent her from continuing to text the group chat. We'll all be back at work tomorrow and I'm worried about what to say to her, if I should say anything at all or just pretend like it didn't happen, and I'm worried that my coworkers who don't know about her alcoholism will start asking questions.

alcoholism,heathumss,2019/01/01,"Love hate relationship with alcohol Hello! I'm a 27 female .This will be short because I hate typing on my phone. So basically before I got pregnant I smoked and drank. Not every day would I drink but when I did. I would always go overboard and do cringy shit that made my anxiety even worse the next few days. They problem tho is that I LOVED how it made me feel. So that's why I would down more and more.  Now that I'm pregnant, I obviously can't partake.  I love and hate who I am sober. I'm a stable minded woman now but angry on the inside now that I have to actually deal with my emotional issues. My relationships are stable. ( Everyone has left me I believe due to my stupid actions as drunk me) therefore I don't have a lot of friends.  Now I'm able to be more calm and make friends. The problem is how do I maintain this after birth! I hate feeling bored!! I hate that my father was an alcoholic and obviously so am I.  I want to drink like a normal 27 year old woman and have a few.  I have one 11 year old and I was sober for that pregnancy too but obviously still very young so I didn't make concious life choices.  I want to be a better person. Especially for the new year.  I guess how do I maintain this sobriety. When I think it's stupid and boring and I hate how I feel sober. :( Also ranting a bit. I do have support from my fiance but he is NOT always going to be sober especially with special occasions. But all in all he is not a big drinker.

alcoholism,Helipilot22,2019/01/01,"Atheist based Alcoholics Anonymous, is there such a thing? I'm not an AA member per say but I do frequent them often to show support to my family member. I try to relate alcoholism through my struggles with depression as I do not suffer from substance abuse. When doing the cross connection I constantly get a mouthful of Jesus. I have nothing wrong with christianity, ok maybe I do but it's not the topic of this post. My problem is that these meetings preach so much it feels like they alienate the atheist's and agnostics for you cannot become sober alone, you need a higher power. For I honestly believe what truly aids sobriety is networking and making connections. I honestly like going to meetings because people there don't rely on a bar being their only source of happiness.

I have thought about this for a while because I live in one of the most drug ridden counties of my state. It's even got a netflix documentary about it. But the support for sobriety is 100% faith based. A large percentage of people that are using I could almost guarantee are agnostic to some degree.",4.938630377524142,7.234649547263683,5.635106818846937,75.72068481123793,70.94029850746269,8.510506292069069,31.22651448639157,9.168548406835145,3.1699538191395966,873,39,140,19,17,283,130,201,0.079,0.7070000000000001,0.214,0.9826,1,1,3,0,1,0,16.0,0,2,3,1,9,14,0,1,13,1,16,5,1,2,0,21,27,9,0,3,6,0,1,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,11,4,3,0,2,3,0,3,5,5,1,1,2,2,20,9,24,23,3,11,6,2,0,0,8,2,0,4,6,104,31,0,0.0,0.1856794047430003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3349573017200088,0.15692553853976998,0.16230751565955498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19106170976945072,0.17307731329992682,0.0,0.17656200551262868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693511942804951,0.0,0.12512266331301902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13497676859998836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18173744989038101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035075285442202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14773516926710348,0.0,0.07923885511680227,0.11195587426914533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08187612981200898,0.0,0.08906366961859971,0.0,0.1253377869164525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668240154500471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15312421545472638,0.0,0.13838054375226158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046072151802292,0.0,0.15743937869226335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152021645819373,0.1162007824255672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15037045182311662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10619285642110377,0.1191873789079369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21729027141852586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500878360845711,0.0,0.0,0.14995327791490212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12462455192808053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16383056449834132,0.0,0.0,0.3556723512042098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10411322418211023,0.0,0.0,0.12441270117351493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10639791208405013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13534980727632928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17134118022136546,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ThrowAlcoholAwayPls,2019/01/01,"So I guess I really should stop drinking.. My behaviour is uncontrollable. I noticed I drank a lot in the last couple of months. I even quit my job because I couldn't handle it any more. But yesterday.. Well.. I went out partying, got punched by a dude because I was touching his girlfriend's hair (according to my mate), I lost my atm card and to top it off..

alcoholism,mtassell9,2019/01/01,"Black liqour hole So I have really slowed down on my drinking lately. I have bad experiences and an angel of a girl friend to thank for that. Last night I kind of let loose. For some reason, I dont feel drunk and i just consume everything in sight. I cant figure myself out. I can be black out drunk and i just dont recognize it in my brain. Im convinced im not feeling it and more alcohol is the answer. Does anyone else experience this? I never puke and when i was younger i would drink 2 or 3 times a week. Id say my tolerance is high. Im about 185lbs so my body gets very drunk but my mind doesnt have a ""youre drunk"" alarm. It leads me into trouble. I just wish i could cut myself off at a reasonable level.",-0.15627450980392155,1.9703500065359485,2.1472222222222217,94.80750000000002,88.15032679738562,5.491503267973857,16.99673202614379,6.937597516519254,-0.09706797385620902,553,13,129,8,18,187,102,153,0.1,0.7609999999999999,0.139,0.353,1,0,3,0,0,1,16.0,0,1,0,1,7,8,1,1,6,0,15,9,2,3,1,27,20,10,0,3,6,0,2,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,5,8,7,0,6,6,0,1,6,4,0,0,1,6,22,4,15,15,2,20,1,0,3,0,4,11,0,2,8,80,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14876156313147745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09733128545762863,0.1426259837116908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11622547976201845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15461888058886625,0.0,0.15539229248953484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111391982323602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12181411826173418,0.0,0.3262807450462099,0.2727243557281033,0.0,0.0,0.11628303204651178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12510322456656972,0.2723269669000922,0.0,0.0,0.14076655009333128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075449215673559,0.0,0.07272581306002703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14707154942866396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4510769210801268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14495449900229426,0.0,0.11346588968570682,0.1570227095090761,0.0,0.0,0.1423405666386566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055146495608672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735896940498994,0.0,0.0,0.13062897700927692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08917454285292327,0.2862398290886195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11069675480535306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281558795854626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811681464736833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11485388068310512,0.0,0.0,0.11165716547921252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600721581347329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888308562905564,0.0,0.0,0.0

I previously consumed a large amount of alcohol the night before and I typically do and failed at my attempts at sobriety. This is a huge wake up call.

alcoholism,TJR07094,2019/01/01,"Newbie Hi Everyone - 

Just found this group so wanted to share my story. I was 15 years sober ( from alcohol)  before a breakup of a LTR ( 20 plus years) in mid 2017. In fact, I lived sober with my alcoholic ex. Since then I have really struggled with my sobriety.  I have tried quitting many times over the last 18 months but always fall victim to something easy to numb me.  

Last week, I decided that this time I needed to find my way back to an alcohol free life. Over the past year, I have experienced heart palpitations, poor sleep and night sweats, foggy headedness and hangovers that impact my life. From a health point of view alone, I can't continue with this destructive behavior.  

Today is my 5th day sober. Its been tough few days but seems to be getting better. Fortunately I have been able to do this while being off from work so a little easier in terms of my need for space to begin to heal.   


I come from a long lineage of alcoholics in my family so you would think that I would know better than to get back into a destructive habit. My dad actually died from a fall when inebriated.  That said, I need to move past the excuses and baggage and get back to my journey of sobriety. 

Oddly Jan 1 is a new beginning so just felt the need to share my story and be a bit cathartic. 

&amp;#x200B;

alcoholism,NightWolfeMan,2019/01/01,"To all those starting the year off without alcohol 2019 I haven't posted a lot on here before but i feel like today is a good day to do so. I'm a recovering alcoholic and I've been alcohol free for 3 years now and it was the best decision I ever made. The only way i was able to do it though was going to AA meetings. I have no doubt i would not have been able to quit if i had not gone. I went twice a week for a month and for 3 months after that once a week. I no longer go but what i learned there truly helped me for life. The best thing that helps me now whenever i think i can just have one and be good is to remember I'm not physically able to do that. Nothing can change that. Its like someone who is allergic to peanuts, they were born with with it and just one can kill them. Just one drink would set me back to the hell i was in.",2.285510033444816,2.8800031195652167,3.846304347826088,92.69602006688964,74.8695652173913,7.618060200668896,22.8494983277592,7.882392219407189,0.6867948160535118,650,16,162,9,13,217,105,184,0.119,0.6990000000000001,0.182,0.9313,0,0,4,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,2,3,11,10,2,1,11,0,24,6,0,1,2,29,34,10,1,3,10,0,1,2,0,2,5,0,0,0,12,7,4,0,5,1,1,4,7,3,1,4,11,1,18,8,20,20,4,25,1,0,0,0,6,3,1,3,17,117,30,1,0.3734635453703208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3991189524841834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957234712869603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1059299900734298,0.0,0.26128463333094665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13169163716762314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08028436363187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12195069846875455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11260638599297887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294479662107318,0.08893414381136731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414986262031558,0.2088290019991526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668831614587031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377273599082014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792944890807837,0.12163694926373772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10583511703036033,0.0,0.11779341220005107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19873002590968947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11944944805011368,0.0,0.0,0.13257549576260688,0.25306856365545183,0.09467861838867052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11922494720190685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13240815034593148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14102046484579395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10547815001908684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.088113139873144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08270419495646535,0.07976678669209121,0.12230867904945035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11799992435496408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09881265967260064,0.1997132860815207,0.0,0.0,0.11540148270981344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12000184355309801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17686519162566128,0.0,0.0,0.16033218582345313
alcoholism,reflectivelettuce,2019/01/01,"So embarassed So last night we were at my wifes work friends house. I got extremely drunk. I wasnt trying to and i dont even know how it happened. The whole night was great and i felt really close to my wife the whole night. Then she tried to put me to bed and it got out of hand. 

I dont remember anything but apparently i yelled at her in front of everyone. I said i wanted a divorce in front of her friend and her friends daughter.I called a lyft driver to go home. Then called her all night telling her im going to kill myself. Like 30 times.  Her friend ended up amswering telling me to go to bed. I woke up this morning not remembering any of it. My pants are soaked with urine. I lost my wallet and wedding ring. 

Not only did i embarass her in front of her own friends but i NEVER yell at her. I cant believe i did that for no reason. And this morning she wasnt even that mad at me. Just embarassed. 

Im so sorry. Idk why she isnt leaving me after this. I kind of wish she was so i at least could feel like i got what i deserved. 

This woman deserves so much better than me. Im so sorry and embarassed and ashamed i cant even put it into words. 

I am posting here because many years ago, i got drunk and tried to commit suicide. The only reason i failed was because of how drunk i was. After that i went to AA for a few months and it helped a lot. I figured i wasnt an alcoholic and just depressed so i stopped going. And i have succussfully been able to drink moderatly until last night. So this just felt like the right place. 

There is no way to make up for this. I am writing this just so i can say it out loud.

alcoholism,relentlessraisin,2019/01/01,"I was the Designated Driver tonight. Usually I'm the one who doesn't know when to stop drinking and ends up so trashed I can't even walk straight.

When I showed up at my friends house tonight he was already drinking and told me I would have to drive. I still drank but I was conscious about the amount I drank, which never happens. When we showed up to the bar to meet friends they were also much less sober than me and asked me to drive them home, so I only had one drink. 

I've been struggling with a drinking problem for the last 6 months so tonight was a big deal to me. Especially because it was New Year's Eve, obviously a holiday associated with drinking heavily.

alcoholism,Princess_Batman,2019/01/02,"we assumed you were sleeping it off"" I'm struggling with alcohol addiction. I hate it, I feel like a piece of shit. I've talked to my doctor, I'm trying to get better, but I'm struggling hard.

Staying with my folks for the holidays.

Woken up yesterday in the early AM thirsty as hell so went up and downstairs a couple times just to chug a bunch of water. Decided not to drink anything, went back to sleep.

I slept crazy late (side effect of new meds) and asked my parents why they didn't knock on my door since we had breakfast plans (and mum had offered to come give me a wake up call the night before, since she knows I sleep hard.)

""Well we heard you up and about this morning so we assumed you got drunk and were sleeping it off.""

Thanks Mum! I already know I'm a drunk piece of shit but now I feel an extra level of worthless. Even when I'm not drinking, I might as well be, right? This just gets to be my identity now.

I hate myself, and everything I'm doing or not doing in my life. I wish I was dead. Thought about knocking back all my depression pills with a nice big glass of vodka and just passing out. Never going to amount to anything from here on anyway.

JK, I'll probably just get completely wasted instead because that's apparently all I'm good for and I'm too cowardly to do anything else.",2.321249999999999,4.293865897727276,3.450000000000003,89.92000000000004,77.52272727272728,6.218181818181819,24.63636363636364,7.1686216300943375,0.9988590909090912,1023,36,211,12,24,330,154,264,0.202,0.696,0.102,-0.9872,2,0,4,0,0,0,33.0,4,3,1,3,20,16,5,2,10,0,13,19,8,1,3,41,43,16,1,1,10,3,4,1,0,1,5,1,1,0,6,17,7,0,9,6,0,5,5,9,2,0,13,5,28,7,37,27,7,33,1,2,0,0,18,15,3,4,13,133,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139978974276677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11175466767639264,0.0,0.0,0.11539677187656633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581592323522452,0.0,0.0977598308411872,0.0,0.0,0.1608173902430087,0.0,0.06374555136229436,0.0,0.08898227531369,0.0,0.0,0.09248461017680644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067787503368439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900787141767596,0.10964077336345854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11570589577741346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09006690608902755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10703291731171298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20487966851165326,0.0,0.0,0.08735570754440067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906820299223274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09398173151975853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10574854615993093,0.0747055905879418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1639021982345459,0.100314095318341,0.059430146762924414,0.0877092489883685,0.08363503438925599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18735027093003945,0.20648455691662748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149390464283366,0.0,0.11796071746923208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07386163659126202,0.051088140856996526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615488068939447,0.0,0.0,0.1109333760101934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065165285558869,0.10099538736002478,0.0,0.0981328617908957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11611379386433858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11274529592623116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930311916864953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21468139345647688,0.17300453313731076,0.0,0.4185863446957008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145884294667273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21864076641090596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840502619303954,0.0,0.09627498819161492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08301774586177331,0.06097622963976415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099688972509287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18804389398891516,0.1938768520411356,0.09435912225709904,0.0,0.12025156539111978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,MagnusTheGood,2019/01/02,"I believe I’m/becoming an alcoholic but I’m not sure and idk who to talk to Good evening, and happy new year, 

As I type this, I am drunk so bear with me. I’m 19 years old, I’ve been drinking since I was 16, always at parties or social gatherings. My father drinks all the time, I’ve always been exposed to it and around it. Through out the years I’ve been drinking fairly regularly, but it wasn’t until I was 18 that I really became physically dependent on alcohol.

There was a time when I was 18 that i realized I have a problem with falling asleep at night, I started to have trouble with school as a result so I turned back to alcohol, drinking until I was drunk enough to fall asleep within minutes, almost every night. This went on for months. Mostly beer, I was fairly picky but then I began resorting to anything I could get my hands on, wine, liquor, moonshine, a couple very desperate nights I shamefully admit I even turned to mouthwash. (I know, it’s disgusting and I need help). 

I’m now 19 and nothing has changed, if I can’t drink then I’m up all night craving to drink and fall asleep peacefully. A recent visit to the doctors office for an ear infection revealed I have high blood pressure. I start college tomorrow and I got so nervous that I couldn’t fall asleep and, despite an unreliable New Years resolution to stop drinking, I drank enough to fall asleep as well as realize I may possibly have a serious problem that might become much worse if I continue later in life. I’ve had a very difficult upbringing as well as a very stressful past year or so due to some stupid decisions I made when I was 17, and I feel as thought that may be apart of the problem, but I don’t know for sure. I just want to figure this all out.

I’m not sure if what I’m dealing with is necessarily alcoholism but I’m certainly physically dependent upon it to fall asleep. I don’t crave it during the day but there have been multiple instances where I will drink throughout the day and even mornings if I don’t drink the night before. 

I’m not entirely sure, and I don’t mean to sound ignorant to people who truly suffer from alcoholism but I’m just looking for feedback and advice. I don’t know who to go to or how to solve this problem. I just see alcohol as the easiest solution to most things and I’m not proud of that, I feel like I need help but I don’t know how to get it and I’m even scared to try to find help.

alcoholism,ThrowAwayAccountYATK,2019/01/02,"Sorry for the book... I posted to r/quitdrinking about a month ago but I didn’t get too many responses as I was drunk when posting but did get a few replies that were helpful.

[link to original post]
https://reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9umjxl/drunk_worried_looking_for_answers/

I’m recalling that post to this sub, not drunk but feeling okay (with the help of 3 shots and 4 beers) after a pseudo-bender from these past 4 days.
I say “pseudo-bender” because I worked on Monday (NYE) but the previous 2 days were spent mostly drinking heavily. 
Though I got decent sleep during said bender, I woke up early Monday feeling like absolute shit. Went to work, but the whole day I felt a different hangover. 
I was dizzy and felt random spells of heavy dizziness (I needed to sit down). 
I felt like I was going to have a seizure, though I’ve never had one before I could imagine that would be a sign (maybe I’m being a hypochondriac though). 
I “muscled” through the day and eventually started to feel better toward the end.
But I did NOT want to go out and drink for NYE. I wanted nothing but to go home and sleep until today (NYD) but I already purchased an expensive ticket and hotel room with some friends so, anyway, long story short...
Went out, got hammered went to bed at like 4, woke up after maybe 4 hours of sleep, went to 7-11 bought a bunch of water and Powerade; rehydrated and took 4 shots then passed out again. 
I woke up 2 hours later, took 3 more shots and then was sobering up until 10:45 tonight...
The shakes started, along with crazy anxiety so I started drinking again (hence the 3 shots and 4 beers)... 
Not happy about it but I know I was going to get terrible sleep and wanted to be somewhat rejuvenated for work in the morning so I felt the need to do the only thing that helps me fall asleep easily.

So yeah to reference my original post, I’m so scared of having a seizure or DT. I’m just curious if I should call in to work tomorrow to get more rest and hydrate further and begin the tapering off process.
**I know no one here is a doctor or should give medical advice, I’m just looking for a similar situation or suggestion**

I know I need to quit and that’s the plan for 2019, but I want to taper off to avoid said embarrassment in the original post. I also know I should probably see a M.D. but I’m taking it one step at a time and doing this my way.
I currently have a drinking problem, but I truly believe I can control it, I’m just paranoid about the immediate medical repercussions. I can kick this thing without my family and friends knowing.

alcoholism,thistimeforgood,2019/01/02,"Hopefully a happy new year. Today is my first day. Day one. Well, day one after a bender. But that, alone, makes it even more of a “day one” than any one I thought I’ve had before. 

I turned 30 a few weeks back. Got hammered the night before, and was hung over as hell on my birthday, which was one of my lowest lows. 

Drinking hasn’t brought me pleasure anymore. And it’s gotten to the point where all I want to do when I’m drunk is text my friends and tell them I need help. Because I really do. And I’ve finally opened up to someone about it, a friend that’s been sober for 8 years, and she’s been incredible. 

So tonight it’s seltzer water for me. And tomorrow it will be the same. I really hope that the day after that is the same, and every other day follows suit. I’m learning it really is one day at a time. Hell, I even bought a coin to keep in my pockets that says just that. Hopefully any time I want to buy alcohol, I’ll feel that coin and remember all the damage it’s done to my life. Lost relationships, friendships, opportunities, and the last half of my 20s to it. 

I think it’s time to start gaining things. I’m tired of drinking until I can’t remember. 

*lifts a can of seltzer* here’s to a new year.

alcoholism,xyz635,2019/01/03,"Dating someone new, he did not disclose his alcoholism until after we became official I started casually seeing someone 2 months ago, and we decided to give being in an exclusive relationship a try a few days ago. He’s a great guy but he told me only recently that he is a functioning alcoholic and how it has affected his life up till now. Apparently he’s been addicted for a while (he’s in his 40s), has had two DUIs in the last 6 years, is estranged from his young kids because of it, etc. He told me that in the new year he really wants to clean up his act and work on getting sober. I commend him for wanting that, but I’m unsure he will be able to. I’m seeing no concrete plan or follow through- plus he works in the bar industry and all his close friends party and drink and do drugs on the regular.

I’m torn because while I really like him and we have something really good blossoming between us, I ultimately do not want to get involved long term with someone with substance abuse issues. I feel like such an asshole even writing that down. But I have a lot going for me in my life, my life is really stable and going in a good direction, and I don’t want to be “dragged” down with him, for lack of a better phrase. Is that harsh? I already spent too much of last year dating someone who had addiction issues and it tore my life up emotionally and physically, and I do not ever want to go back voluntarily.

I really care about this person and I want to be supportive and for him to get better, but if I’m being honest, I don’t want to be in a relationship with him anymore. I feel like I’m being selfish to put myself and my needs first, and not sticking around to help him. And I’m kind of afraid that if I break up with him, he’ll undo whatever progress he’s trying to make right now and drink to deal with it. But even thinking about things in his best interest, I feel strongly that if he wants to prioritize getting sober, dating should be the last thing on his mind.

Pretty unsure how to handle this situation and I want to be as loving and kind about it as possible. Any suggestions or stories of similar situations would really be helpful.",6.171170542635658,5.821083632558143,7.204011627906978,75.32493217054264,66.16279069767441,10.608527131782948,32.56782945736434,10.222266870305534,3.1535736434108532,1702,63,333,37,24,576,206,430,0.079,0.721,0.2,0.9968,1,0,6,0,1,0,37.0,4,0,0,9,14,21,0,1,16,0,30,13,0,4,2,74,70,39,0,17,14,0,3,3,1,4,9,0,1,3,17,32,5,0,5,4,1,6,7,2,0,2,7,5,43,19,63,49,8,58,0,0,2,1,49,21,0,6,33,225,60,2,0.07373307609810703,0.08736163825442878,0.0,0.1607598727154654,0.0,0.0,0.13071984632346428,0.15759646937712454,0.0,0.0,0.08136628296334683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05014102016162796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312339882074828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06563807004722934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056696184248273676,0.0,0.08989399764747277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737831439566673,0.13042182790780465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517578513394353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047551734298085,0.07601556384864151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1444606882018086,0.08550695957142422,0.0,0.0,0.08293978640964468,0.0,0.0,0.08223187030782936,0.09740000273919462,0.0666957886290094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118449761187658,0.1053498485941058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06271731686249048,0.0,0.0,0.0569659916905941,0.0,0.15408995616308974,0.07073148522399683,0.12571261897787914,0.12368761197798225,0.0,0.08129097669878807,0.0,0.07300733763483658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09884345336404372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15391634998370135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15356330480946473,0.0,0.18030689412759296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083194087768392,0.1080667697400078,0.0,0.0,0.06525145210223217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06268522457885743,0.0665469799100316,0.0,0.049217400842205584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07444938792181516,0.0,0.0588530378869305,0.0,0.054202294768578935,0.05467214165833152,0.0,0.14242372871086104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056077326912268896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438087803154244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08312296470235596,0.0,0.07501304591111986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07412210669086748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2834117795505897,0.0,0.0728025174223015,0.158323459791888,0.0,0.06296764411710018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11751143079329562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16575813365811726,0.0,0.0,0.2498951844202014,0.056763324252498325,0.0,0.0,0.05218865076430013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08367142097964872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796995893097446,0.04724517795254268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14091022794660096,0.0,0.10011983740877116,0.0,0.07202650151286216,0.0,0.08869181203181367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.391407107767132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073571151122399,0.0,0.0,0.052377861754793614,0.0,0.0,0.14244505071996766

alcoholism,__The_Senate__,2019/01/03,"Haven't Drank Alcohol This Year I'm not really an alcoholic to be sure, but I used to self medicate when I was depressed, suicidal and hopeless or when I wanted to press away my anxiety.

I'm depressed right now, but I don't drink and haven't done it this year. Even on the new year's eve party I could hold on to not getting drunk as I usually do at a party. Many times I've blacked out, fell and lost my stuff. Not anymore! Whatever life makes me want to go through I'm not drinking. I'm not hiding anymore.

No more feeling sick the next day. No more wasted money of drinks. No more acting like a fool.

alcoholism,here2live,2019/01/03,"Post removed from r/stopdrinking just looking for support I'm 22 and I've come to the realization that I will die if I continue. I have been drinking on average 750ml vodka a day lately (depends on the day. Work days usually half a fifth). I get really bad withdrawl symptoms if I don't drink. I will hallucinate if I don't sleep drunk. Tho I'm very high functioning with work and such and my roommates have said they new I drank alot (I have been open with my drinking problem), But they say I seem rather coherent and am suprisingly nice / helpful considering the amount I drink.. But If I don't drink I obviously become cranky and on edge. 

I am currently attempting to taper. I have beer for withdrawals. My anxiety is rising but I'm trying to wait a bit longer to have a beer.

 I'm resisting the urge to go pick up a 750ml..  

Sorry if this post is all over the place. My mind is jumbled. 

I desperately need support and guidance.",2.010737704918032,4.517147819672137,3.711833333333335,84.74775000000002,81.73224043715847,7.375846994535519,26.089890710382512,8.395991825355821,2.076410054644809,733,31,144,17,20,244,107,183,0.067,0.8690000000000001,0.065,-0.0845,2,0,9,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,2,3,4,5,0,0,11,0,17,11,1,2,2,30,32,15,1,8,10,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,2,10,9,1,1,9,0,4,3,2,0,1,4,3,22,3,15,26,4,22,0,0,1,0,5,8,0,8,8,87,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09770615474643686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066416338764083,0.0,0.1410577223878269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394381659737738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11002026399813056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2471082832862033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325541511516764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6255893921084952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672890957810426,0.0,0.07258674256244584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560864090240758,0.13494416508257825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14407476167907113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725340605046887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12896172076321255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09470344435165703,0.0,0.12335366108956043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13344117811715256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2446426734105775,0.0,0.0,0.1222116720208752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08182129228022532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214918433803436,0.10156880248143957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11627232934115027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12781315921945965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429731140556207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2898723744934069,0.0,0.13275094007232874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08671412133251956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14066654987308472,0.10538313559274287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859647028339356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Was drinking 6-12 beers a night for 2 months with periodic breaks in between, usually only 2 or 3 days a week sober just because I felt awful. I went cold turkey almost 54 hours ago and the withdrawals set in 24 hours into it. Crazy Mood swings, incredible depression, thoughts I never imagined before, thinking horrible things, considering quitting my dream job which is insane, topped with the worst insomnia. Its crazy how one moment my brain says “this is fine, you’re over thinking and it’s going to be okay” then 5 minutes later I’m having a conversation in my head with my boss about quitting. That can’t happen. I need to get it together. It’s 2:30am PST and I just bought 1 beer at the store to help me sleep. I have no intentions of going back but I also had no idea the withdrawals would be so intense after 2 months of heavy drinking. I could handle this if I could just sleep. They are minor. I wish I could do this cold turkey like I intended but the lack of sleep is making me an insane moody bitch. I have hot/cold chills, zero hand shakes or DT’s but I feel better now after this one can and am not craving more beer. This one was enough to let me sleep. 32/f I do not have a family. I have a wonderful job and a golden retriever puppy who my heart is aching for because we have not been on walks, just for her to go to the bathroom. She doesn’t deserve this and is wondering why we aren’t playing yet is faithfully at my side sticking it out with me. I have sustained long term sobriety before. This is why I got her, I was in a good place. She is my life. I want to give her the best life I can. I live in an amazing place in Tahoe alone. We go hiking and she has more pup friends than I could wish for. I’m not in need of medical attention. I have a background in the medical field and know that I’m okay. *What can I do to speed this up?* Continue with another beer tomorrow before bed and maybe a 3rd night if needed? Surely just one is far better than what I was doing before and I have the ability to stop thankfully now that I see how serious this has become. I didn’t even realize that I haven’t eaten or showered since my at home detox started. Food sounds awful. So does a shower. I slightly saw moving objects in my room but that very well could have been the sleep deprivation. So far my plan tmw is to wake when my dog does (I work from home) and take her on a hike because she deserves it then back to bed. Would love advice on how to deal. I know I need to eat and attend AA. So if there is any advice outside of those two areas I’m already planning on tackling I would love to hear them. 

I had no idea it was possible to get addicted so fast.

alcoholism,DrChestplate,2019/01/03,"It’s hard to tell if I have a problem I’m 17(M) and I’ve only been drinking for like 9 months or so but in that time it’s been quite bad. I’ve been full blackout drunk 3 times and partial way more times than I can count. I have a history of alcoholism in my family and apparently my drinking behavior is getting to be too much even for high school parties. My friends have approached the school counselor about my drinking who has subsequently talked to me and my parents. I’m scared because once I start drinking it’s hard to stop until I blackout. I’m tired of waking up in the morning with almost no recollection of the night before or how I got where I am, wearing someone else’s clothes thinking “not again”. Even my dad (who has been drinking for 40+ years and drinks more than average I’d say (although he can control it he’s not an alcoholic)) told me that I’ve been way worse than he ever has been.  Is this a problem or normal hardcore youth drinking?

alcoholism,thenewsecret2,2019/01/03,"Can I drink alone and not be considered an alcoholic? Sorry if this is not the right place for this question. Im a 22 yr old university student and i love getting myself drunk and playing video games because i (genuinely) find it fun. My family is concerned that this is a huge sign of alcoholism. 

I have never let alcohol interfere with school/my 2 part time jobs, a steady girlfriend, and having many friends. You could say that i might have a bit of a tolerance to alcohol, but have gone multiple months without drinking to deal with my school schedule (so i don't think im addicted)

Now that you have more information, i want to know if this is normal behaviour, why i like it so much, or any other general comments you may have.

Tldr; i drink alone to play video games, family is concerned, i never let it interfere with life, am i an alcoholic?",3.7515512708150713,5.82666992638037,4.949487291849255,80.31443251533744,73.66257668711657,9.074320771253287,29.43426818580193,9.606745405546679,3.0083728308501305,670,29,125,18,14,221,102,163,0.044,0.828,0.128,0.9038,1,2,8,0,0,0,22.0,0,3,0,0,3,6,0,0,8,0,20,12,0,0,2,30,26,10,0,5,7,0,0,1,2,2,7,1,0,0,11,7,9,2,5,10,0,1,6,0,0,0,1,1,17,6,11,19,4,11,0,0,0,1,13,3,0,6,8,85,28,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11881207640514732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5823705706074208,0.0,0.2257556292056351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411499670716354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06643755270794131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1189857361670878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870173678320747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11236096206608027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3202977341469792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054867635559951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09961227710800023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08420319875740652,0.0,0.05694128558224961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354496402497909,0.0,0.10815292555649124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05989648526124443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2228934820768841,0.07698084445512211,0.053245614453106715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09836515453824254,0.0,0.0,0.110495859982141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561813896407135,0.0,0.0,0.0869925002550009,0.0,0.08011809263841482,0.0,0.1681152119030915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10678426306002538,0.0,0.0,0.11436367626796552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802245855529453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386837099004316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209054656266705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307442731227436,0.0,0.08667095303832864,0.0,0.22060162088977345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12200218720037305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06983456254170413,0.0,0.0,0.06355128136862592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428344255597375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834394752979138,0.0,0.0,0.105059719668506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Geoguybri,2019/01/03,"Work found out   So I went back to work today, after a 3 week binge in December.  I missed work.  A LOT of work in December.  I've missed work before, being ""sick"" but never like this.  I still don't know how I even still have my job, thankfully someone in upper management has known about my issues since 2015 and can relate.  Anyway, apparently one day on my bender (I don't really remember this) A Coworker texted me and asked where I was.  Apparently totally blitzed instead of saying ""the flu"" or just ""sick"" I told them I was drunk in a bar.  Apparently that got out and now it seems everyone at work knows I was pretty much drunk for 3 weeks, not really at work.  A few days here and there.  Half days because the withdrawals were so bad.  Anyway, fast forward to today.  Everyone is treating me different.  Seeming to give disapproving looks, conversations cut short because they don't want to talk to me.  It's like I have now become a lesser person, some kind of piece of shit in some of their eyes..  Has anyone else ever been ""outed"" at work?  Did your colleagues treat you different?  Did it last or eventually go away with time?  This just sucks..",3.0325862822193086,5.407885045871558,4.209947575360419,83.36897553516822,76.9816513761468,7.638619484491046,22.766273481869806,8.563005593585519,1.603539274792486,892,27,170,19,21,291,139,218,0.149,0.8009999999999999,0.051,-0.9649,6,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,2,3,8,19,12,3,0,8,0,17,8,2,1,3,29,34,10,0,1,6,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,0,1,7,8,3,0,7,3,0,3,5,6,0,2,11,3,21,6,27,22,7,37,0,2,2,0,12,17,2,7,21,116,28,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308203534243599,0.10709195027435572,0.0,0.0,0.09771104948587064,0.0,0.09819893403714078,0.08036857184087352,0.08726890413213656,0.12742748570798593,0.11543289805956412,0.08893787388672758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20221810469776744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21839998051570286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08731211776143986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06903373852433982,0.09454331629165096,0.0,0.199744549443556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11459956382968745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10026403940595983,0.05940049160619173,0.0,0.08359330119174173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090905622235661,0.10371886692011856,0.0,0.0,0.10884033606791813,0.11488169278507307,0.08519684211693347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10212529658584453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08776954056528306,0.0,0.0,0.0888582193268252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07683340737664153,0.0,0.08061140834103743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07082470218768054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912618598563638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633328237595012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391494958237227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11839952320592938,0.0,0.0,0.08311761330327433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19030013689124103,0.0,0.0,0.1072871345992743,0.0864591026457551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855851301128266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16693783489526778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08400832153773721,0.0,0.0962269477606254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060945803000332324,0.0,0.19814336589006332,0.09987227472177798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061647947009510685,0.0,0.16767749188600609,0.0,0.0,0.0968900545395326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6087279511258958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,NoRegrtsNotEvenWon,2019/01/04,"How stupid am I? I'm 29F and I'm 4 days sober, wasn't planning on it but realized it today and figured I'd keep going, maybe try a 30 day thing just to see if I can do it. 

I don't drink every day but I haven't gone more than a week without a drink in a few years. I know I have a problem with binge drinking. I've blacked out, damaged relationships, lost friends, been unable to stop drinking, it's affected my work. It's a problem. I know it, my family knows it and everyone I've hurt knows it. 

Anyway, I liked the idea of doing a sobriety trial run so I started looking into AA meetings. Then I thought about how I would have to tell my husband that I'm going to AA meetings and what he would say or think. And then I remembered that we're going on an all-inclusive vacation on Feb 1 and how could I not drink while on vacation? And now I'm thinking how stupid am I that this is how I reason with myself that I don't need to get sober and I can just ""try it on"" and see how I like it. 

Does anyone have any advice?",0.8677149321266953,2.460269018099549,3.1357895927601795,92.2617839366516,80.53846153846153,6.229954751131222,22.814705882352943,7.1686216300943375,0.6662704072398196,787,26,183,10,20,270,120,221,0.146,0.8009999999999999,0.053,-0.9609,0,0,5,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,3,12,10,2,0,9,0,18,5,0,8,0,48,41,23,0,7,8,1,0,2,1,2,0,1,0,0,17,13,5,2,12,5,0,5,6,7,2,0,5,5,22,3,19,33,2,25,0,3,4,0,8,8,0,2,14,115,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151068598296093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801039080580636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236425092987992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404886381923687,0.0,0.0,0.22790200956842266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10308225722220918,0.0,0.0,0.5769660074935019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09924646189110406,0.11255714290904473,0.0,0.0,0.11104562872798134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100729395035126,0.0,0.06154246384183677,0.0,0.2008350057474271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12610083256292348,0.1329750029547131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10470065249397106,0.0,0.0,0.25894584154540706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11509632312334743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09891722951128044,0.0,0.1285859835272195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11833982984658277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734270253416053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.225425754862419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12111177304569938,0.0,0.12646659188148593,0.13343755402565746,0.0,0.0,0.09367445674885908,0.0,0.0,0.187733014160756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08337514611833052,0.0,0.0,0.09848099543364558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10295708208328494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825704939151606,0.15095518115499215,0.0,0.0935152184283296,0.0,0.0,0.11165486724467168,0.0,0.0,0.15994868522276376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09448718109915992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11354913983445572,0.0,0.08575538003224585,0.0,0.0,0.16735484873500142,0.0,0.0,0.07585542542092563

alcoholism,shizzelman,2019/01/04,"Can’t sleep if I don’t drink New poster, consistent lurker so apologize for mistakes. I’ve always had sleeping issues since I was a child. 37 year old married male with a new kiddo. I have an amazing wife and child with a great, stressful job. I drink in the evenings to relax. I need to do better though and not rely on alcohol. Problem is is that it helps me sleep. Can’t sleep without drinking. On top, I already take sleeping meds. Melatonin and diphenhydramine. A few months ago, I tried stopping drinking but didn’t sleep the entire night. I drank tea which supports sleeping, upped the sleeping meds slightly and worked out that day (I used to be very passionate about working out but have been slipping). I need good rest to perform at my job. I won’t take prescription sleeping meds because when I did, they (took several types) had terrible side effects. 

I’m hoping someone from this community has encountered a similar situation and can help.

alcoholism,Bokkepootje,2019/01/04,"How to help my friend who confided in me? Last year my friend told me that her drinking habit got out of hand and that it turned into alcoholism, drinking every day and needing it. She told me after others helped her and she quit for a while and got it to ""normal behavior"" , only drinking with friends. So I was shocked to hear because I never noticed, but yes of course we had wine when we saw each other. But I didn't know she drank daily at home.


A couple weeks ago she heard her dad is dying, horrible news of course. Now she told me that her drinking has turned to daily again and she badly wants to quit. She couldn't leave a supermarket without buying beer and drinking it all. She postponed it to first of January but still hasn't been able to do it.
Friends keep coming over, and she gets gifted alcohol with the holidays and she buys it for them. But what stays left in her fridge, she drinks. 


I'm the only one who knows. But how do I help? I told her to tell the weekly coach she has for her autism and she says shes done that. But I hear nothing about it. I also don't know if I should tell others, I mean it's a secret she told me. But her brother contacted me an hour ago telling me she's not well and if I know some thing, I told nothing but I wonder if I should confide in him.
I did tell him to look out for her 2 years ago when she was suicidal. He never told her anything but just spoke with her. So maybe I can?


It's a difficult subject but I know others here know this and hope can help me out.

alcoholism,xperiaGIRL,2019/01/04,"500ml of beer daily for years with dinner, dangerous to stop cold turkey? Woke up on day 3 white as a ghost with ( according to apple watch ) low heart rate. 

The rest I cant tell if anxiety or real symptoms. 

Will see a doctor of course but in the meantime, curious if this ""small"" amount, but taken daily with no breaks for years, can be dangerous to suddenly stop.

Told my friends things I shouldn’t have. Ruined my chances with people. I can’t describe this feeling of regret concern anxiety embarrassment at all.

alcoholism,JustAnotherAdict,2019/01/04,"I found out what my problem is. For the past 5 years since my partner killed himself, I've thought I was addicted to alcohol. I would go to sleep drunk, wake up drunk, drink all day long. I didn't, and still don't, want to feel anything. I ended up getting arrested and jailed because of something I did while drunk. I've been on probation for the past 3 years, which stopped me drinking for a while. But I ended up getting off probation around the middle of December, and I ended up smoking some weed, because I could. And I haven't stopped. I've been drinking every now and again, but I've mostly been high. I've found out that I just hate being sober. I utterly hate it. If I don't have any weed, I'll end up getting drunk, and vice versa. I don't know what I'm asking here, if I'm asking anything, but I'd like to think that I'm happy that I'm not going to be the son that turns out like my dad, since it's not just booze I'm addicted to, but it's not being sober. I don't know.

alcoholism,Soberisminthecity,2019/01/05,"What’s the key thing that stopped you drinking? On 12 January I’ll be 7 months without a drink. I’m astonished, sobriety is like a spa weekend - I feel so much better. Rough patch around 5-6 month mark but I’m back to pink cloud, content with my lot, grateful for my life...

Before I got sober, all I wanted to do was drink. My home looked dull without booze. I couldn’t motivate myself to do much else but drink. I lost friends, I isolated myself. I didn’t go out much except to get more booze by the end. 

It’s all about the dopamine - the neurotransmitter of the drive to satisfy desire. I’ve reconfigured my neurons, through my drinking habit turning into an abstinence habit. I now get pleasure from things other than drink. Knowing this and other brain science of addictive behaviour has really helped me understand it and then swerve the booze and get healthy.

Hello everyone! Well, it’s been a little over 2 years since my last drink. Never thought I could do it. Wife would causally mention that I would drink to much , didn’t listen. 

Then I realized one day that my drinking could put me in some serious danger and said fuck it I’m done . Today I feel like a completely different person. I do however get the cravings , never been to any AA meetings ...feel nervous .

alcoholism,TiredAF773,2019/01/06,"Ready to Quit but scared of Seizures So I've been a continual drinker for a while. I have had occasional (read: days) moments of sobriety, but for the last 3 months I have had at least one drink everyday. I don't drink hard liquor and my mainstay has been beer. I usually drink 6 pints give or take an evening during the week, and a 12 pack Friday and Saturday. I've packed on pounds and am so tired of taking acid shits, getting no sleep, and looking like I just pulled an all-nighter to ace an exam. I drive to the liquor store this afternoon to buy a 4 pack of pints, but dear God did I not want to. I am so tired and want to quit, I'd to an in or out patient program but my job offers no insurance and I just cannot afford it. Worse is that I'm in a right to work state and can be fired for ANYTHING. I'm all for AA, but my concern is if I stop cold turkey since this is my longest binge is that I'll suffer a seizure and die. I can't go to a doctor unless I want to pay out the ass. Any advice is appreciated. I haven't touched the pints yet today because I am just SO damn tired.

alcoholism,omegaman1000,2019/01/06,"28 y/o alcoholic who is giving up alcohol and is terrified!!! I used to post on this page 227 days ago when I briefly attempted to give up drinking, that failed spectacularly, what followed was 200 or so heavy days of drinking non stop, noon till dawn

Things have escalated since, I've started to get into trouble at work for being visibly hungover and for failing to turn up on more than one occasions without any notice. I once showed up for work having stayed up all night drinking and taking cocaine. I was sent home by a member of staff. Needless to say I'm on my final warning. I love my job and they have provided great training and support but I seemed to have lost my way. I came clean to my boss about my drinking and they were very supportive and understanding. 

I could see things escalating yet still made excuses to continue drinking, I was getting into pub brawls trouble with the police, always had blackouts and didn't know how I got home. I treated my S/O with utter contempt. I'm now attending weekly counselling for my drinking and will go to my first AA meeting this week which terrifies me

I know I cannot drink anymore but I'm scared of change! If I don't stop drinking, this time next year I will have lost everything!",5.548791841004182,6.5743257489539735,5.886671025104604,79.46339565899585,67.66108786610879,8.820188284518828,33.347541841004194,9.017664075816787,2.8828847280334724,990,44,183,17,16,317,156,239,0.157,0.7809999999999999,0.062,-0.9745,3,0,11,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,2,8,7,13,1,1,2,0,19,11,0,4,1,31,46,17,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,3,0,9,14,10,2,4,10,0,5,4,8,1,2,12,2,26,5,34,30,3,40,0,4,1,1,10,11,0,3,21,113,35,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808599677131604,0.1882816992991524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07329749257771978,0.0,0.0,0.059903857731946765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736108012390882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100750882030294,0.0,0.0,0.09318697499233676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033227085493825,0.0,0.0,0.11362083647750545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6903531269212448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916913217824723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964977044421036,0.0,0.0749288549484924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204622066085967,0.16900688555476054,0.05006327366353554,0.0,0.07045319324536183,0.09711894746772327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17672183394765492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874152027750637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09682333376900584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923201164655689,0.0,0.07950418248713632,0.08335238283184519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936841466560265,0.08266599668383137,0.0,0.0,0.10029044112080997,0.0,0.0938124065729517,0.059691702069864024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436535844128946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07005227917386463,0.08819292299699978,0.0,0.07019589957910556,0.08019334161875358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07286851673138285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06235017756976938,0.09389165029189178,0.07034836149646234,0.14729347625540087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19992576467083856,0.0,0.0,0.06623231571244552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704545425856798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051365676137460126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581604369770676,0.0,0.09170424095522038,0.0,0.07608101564868132,0.0,0.07268303508953038,0.0,0.06992131804175608,0.14132011262057248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08491510193607145,0.0,0.12826036106695454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0567267281056708
alcoholism,sailor_earthh,2019/01/06,"I feel abandoned and helpless I got drunk and broke my foot two months ago. It’s finally healing, but I spent those two months just drinking at home feeling horrible. 

I have bipolar type 1. I lost my insurance and can’t get any treatment. Same goes for my PTSD, insomnia, and panic disorder. I understand that alcoholism is a separate illness and I can’t blame my mental health for me drinking, but I’ll argue it’s a lot harder to not drink when I’m alone all the time just not wanting to listen to my head scream. 

I’ve been trying to tell others that I’m hurting and want to get sober. No one seems to be listening and just tells me I’m smart and to figure it out and quit annoying them. I feel like even though I’m posting here that I’ll just be told to go to AA. It may be well intentioned, but it just feels like I’m being dismissed. I’ve tried AA multiple times and hated it. It doesn’t work for me. 

I just feel like I’m struggling and no matter how hard my feelings get, I’m just brushed aside. No matter how hard I ask for help, no one wants to. I get that it’s MY problem to deal with and that I have to do the work, but feeling like no one cares or wants to help is really hurtful.

alcoholism,Cany7,2019/01/06,"Is this a form of alcoholism? Hi everyone, I am concerned I may be putting myself at risk for alcoholism or if anything alcohol abuse. 

For reference: I'm female and weigh about 135lbs 5'6"" 

I drink heavily on the weekends or most times I have time off and don't have to work the next day.

By ""heavily"" up to 6 drinks in a day. Usually, have my first drink in the afternoon and gradually over several hours into the evening. So, I have my first drink at like 1pm and my 6th by like 8pm. I drink a lot of water during this time and eat and snack a lot, so I stay hydrated and don't make myself sick. I never get ""trashed""  or ""drunk"". It's more like I get a buzz or tipsy and then maintain that buzz throughout the afternoon\evening . 

I do this regularly about twice a week, so like Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday.

Is this a problem?",2.4301972386587782,4.327085668639056,4.095124260355031,85.7697475345168,76.92899408284023,8.293648915187378,26.05956607495069,9.029198982220553,2.108549980276134,654,25,137,16,15,219,98,169,0.059,0.8590000000000001,0.08199999999999999,0.3893,0,0,8,0,1,0,25.0,0,0,0,3,6,6,0,1,12,0,12,14,0,1,1,25,16,20,0,2,6,0,0,4,0,1,4,0,0,0,6,11,13,0,1,7,0,1,3,2,0,3,0,0,15,4,19,14,5,29,0,0,0,0,1,9,0,10,22,94,21,1,0.0,0.14657529736603522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3966228740270606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018022173242938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15956453505859405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6059401115285508,0.0,0.12658550310819106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16341765848497414,0.0,0.0,0.11820954240256472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2104541433242495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12926601193046672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121828746113331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2417524705584071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21034645450085612,0.0,0.0,0.08257692172644117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541224247636404,0.0,0.13156624935153974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11837309760773065,0.0,0.12436202029510494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13975630223090138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318576591158603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21640767182171228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13624832197226758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992321424653222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09006184743300936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

First thing I did is search for this section so I could reach out to anyone willing to listen or give support. So as the title says I’m trying to tackle my alcohol addiction. I’m on day 7 now having started from day one of the new year. Cravings are kicking in. Hoping to meet some people on here.

alcoholism,mishy101,2019/01/06,"family member with stage 4 cirrhosis relapsing... what to do? A family member in her late 40s just got out of their her first stint in rehab (90 days) and came out to living alone for the first time in her life in a apartment and it appears she is drinking again... lying about it to everyone after 14 days out of rehab.  She actually went to an AA meeting two days ago and was asked to take a breathalyzer because they suspected her of drinking.  She declined very angrily and left, not to return.  We found out about it and now no one knows how to handle getting her back into rehab.  

She says she's not drinking and that everyone riding her will drive her to drink...  I wasn't helping with the last placement in rehab but I was around for the holidays this year during this relapse and have since done a lot of research regarding rehab programs.  I have come to realize that that the aftercare part of her first release was nonexistent.  I called a different and more comprehensive rehab program (as compared to her last rehab) that utilizes a sober house w/ outpatient intensive for months following a patient's release.  My research leads me to believe that for someone in her situation to have a chance of success this part of the equation must be part of her aftercare plan.  Am I misreading this?   I understand that interventions are controversial, but she has stage 4 cirrhosis and is on the transplant list... a relapse appears to be potentially deadly, and quickly.  Is my medical research about this accurate?

She is livid at all of us for doubting her veracity about relapse, but she keeps lying about things... a hallmark of her drinking behavior in the past, and she recently smelled of alcohol or mouthwash (?).  My family is out of their depth, as am I, and we could definitely use some advice regarding the use of a professional intervention specialist.  Also, her children (teens) are not living with her and will not be involved in an intervention... and she is separated from her spouse.  What should we do?  The professional intervention specialist is ready to go but everyone is confused about the best plan of action.  She claims her therapist says she should not return to rehab and there is a theoretical planned phone call between her therapist and my family today.  She set it up, so let's see.  Her therapist predates her stint in substance abuse and my family doesn't know him.  But he does exist because I spoke with him briefly once before.  I'm really confused on how to proceed.  Help?

alcoholism,Dredd3Dwasprettygood,2019/01/06,"I can't tell if I have a problem with alcohol I've been drinking heavily for 4 years. People in my life tell me I drink too much or I'm an alcoholic because of the amount I drink, not because of my actions under the influence. Because of this I'll occasionally take a break for one or two days. I crave it but I don't get any physical symptoms.

I go back to drinking because I kind of feel like Instead of living I'm just waiting to die. Is this depression or alcoholism and depression ?

alcoholism,beudacious,2019/01/06,"Is my wife an alcoholic?. So for the last year my wife has been hiding alcohol around the house and drinking when she thinks I'm not looking. The longest she has gone without a drink that I know is 4 days. 

She drinks every night to ""unwind"" and if she doesn't, I have noticed she makes a cash withdrawal to hide her spending in the liquor shop. I have asked her to stop and to seek help as her drinking and subsequent binge eating has made her put on 30kgs and it contributes to poor self image.

I have tried everything from organising and trying to take her to a counselor to getting her family involved to help (they are mostly useless) ok only her sister is any help. I have begged her to stop, tried motivating her physically to get out and about to get endorphins flowing.

Her mother is an alcoholic and she hates the childhood she has and that she has to even talk to her mother, taking her mother to the hospital after she collapsed and pissed and  shit herself still wasn't enough to wake her up. 

Any ideas on what I do next?.

Just to add we have 2 kids and she can hold down a job, but dodges most of her responsibilities elsewhere.",5.10702702702703,6.0902608738738735,5.3838018018018055,82.82381081081084,68.63963963963964,8.442522522522522,27.86306306306307,8.648137234880735,1.8922176576576581,902,29,178,14,15,286,132,222,0.077,0.8759999999999999,0.047,-0.6868,1,0,7,0,0,0,20.0,1,0,1,1,7,5,3,0,12,1,20,12,3,3,0,32,34,17,0,1,5,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,4,16,9,3,4,7,4,3,4,4,0,0,4,1,35,1,31,30,3,21,0,1,1,0,41,7,2,3,11,125,39,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891280893946241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1650737435333579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804648475513913,0.11346609194862507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827466181168348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755919707658275,0.0,0.1241934799912394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254093405323568,0.0,0.08016481824906366,0.0,0.10226083467070064,0.0,0.10908099674840246,0.0,0.11441837284553075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902350048628308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982935894771565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24405853956459195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14004656765409498,0.0,0.13701379911566106,0.0,0.0,0.12044261680422495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670267480163403,0.09893407933122593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019216026485221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11484477283622788,0.08101650682231486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12908010755700486,0.1138990546867467,0.0,0.0,0.13818240747118826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923085953468123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201201322389675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12661708233934926,0.0,0.12458623608485647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09692754209271846,0.2029442380181967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825127247473736,0.09755392032125217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07777004101019742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24721011324274364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169979220856472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07815935167901676

alcoholism,AnimalLover222,2019/01/07,"My mother is drinking a lot...what should I do? (I'm 36, she is 64) My mother has been drinking more and more over the last 2-3 years. A few times she has fallen and hurt herself- bruised head, sore arm etc. One time she could not get up and my father - who is older - could not pick her up. Her mother (my grandmother) was an alcoholic as well. So this is very scary. 

A few months ago I told my mom that I was concerned and asked her why she was drinking more. She said she didn't know. I told her that if she kept drinking too much around friends, they won't want to come over for dinner anymore. (She told me she had gotten drunk when her friend came over for dinner. She fell that night too and they all helped pick her up).

However, these days I feel she is drinking even more than before. They live far away in the winter so I cannot physically see the situation myself. But I often know she's drinking bc she calls me drunk. I considered our prior chat a ""light talk"". I think i need to say or do something again.  

What should I do? Should I specifically ask her if she will stop drinking? Should I ask her to go to AA? Should I threaten to tell people she knows that she has a drinking problem?

alcoholism,hkjake,2019/01/07,"Usually fine, but the occasional outbursts are damaging So long story short, I developed a problem a little after college. I didn't know it at the time but during college, probably a little less than halfway through, I developed depression. I think it was due to stress and exhaustion (17-19hr semesters in engineering and worked 20-30hr/wk for car insurance gas and food money) and alcohol was just easy to turn to to feel better for a bit.

I got married to the girl I was going out with since before college (we're still married) and I love her more than anything in the world. Shortly before we got married I lost my job and was unemployed for several months at the beginning of our marriage. That was super stressful but fortunately she has a pretty good job. Things were a little tight but not terribly so. During this time (3 years or so ago) is when I started drinking more. Not to the point where it was a serious problem, but it was more than most people.

Fast forward a year or two and I'm getting a good buzz after work almost everyday and plastered on the weekends. My depression is still undiagnosed at this time and I'm beginning to become verbally abusive. The next morning my wife would tell me about it and this was a huge wake up call to me. I'm not sure why I got angry. I don't have any pent up regret or anger that I can think of. Anyway at this point I know I need help so I see a therapist and it helps a little. Not much though. I go to my doctor and tell him about what's been happening, minus some of the more extreme cases, but I made it clear that I felt my depression was contributing to many of the problems I was experiencing including hurting relationships with my family and friends and prescribed me an anti-depressant.

Holy shit. I had never experienced not being depressed as an adult. The changes were incredible. It wasn't even anything specific, but I simply didn't have this general feeling of existential dread and lingering feeling of anxiety and hopelessness in the back of my head constantly. Turns out I had severe chronic depression. Just getting on that changed a lot of things for me. I didn't drink nearly as much and my relationship with my wife improved greatly. (This is about a year ago)

Over the last year I've fucked up a few times. Mostly closer to when I first started taking anti-depressants. Recently I had another fuck up. I was out with friends at the neighborhood pub and was about to head home. I had a good buzz and was about to call my uber when another friend invited me to go to a brewery with them. It wasn't even 8PM yet so I thought, ""What the hell?"" I hadn't gotten pissed off or told anyone off while I was drunk for a long time. I figured it was the depression that made me do that when I was drunk, so I wasn't too worried. Let me emphasize that at this point, I didn't feel the need to drink more. I had probably 4 drinks over 2 hours or so and felt perfectly fine to just go home. I simply accepted the invitation because I wanted to spend a little more time with friends and it wasn't late yet.

Fast forward a couple hours and a few beers, apparently I got pretty drunk a lot faster than I anticipated and my wife called asking me to get her an uber from our house to the place she was having her girls night. (This part was told to me the next day, I only remember getting mildly frustrated on the phone.) So I go outside (it's kinda loud in the bar we're at) and fortunately there wasn't anyone around nearby because she said I was yelling and super pissed off at her on the phone. I don't even know why I would be mad about that. It's stupid. Like, we had a great day together that day and we were just planning on having going out with friends. I don't understand what would make me so mad so easily? I'm usually a pretty laid back guy. I don't worry about much and I don't stress out much (not big time anyway, little normal stuff, yeah). I'm not possessive or jealous either. Well not any more jealous than the average dude. Everyone's a tiny bit right?

This is super disappointing. Not just for her but for me too. I thought this was in my past and wouldn't be a problem again. On top of that, our relationship has been amazing recently and I definitely didn't want to screw anything up.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for posting this here, but I wanted to get it off my chest and maybe just ask if anyone else has had a similar experience.",3.950616460554368,5.466499362285717,5.052312153518127,82.10077441364608,71.94857142857144,8.561023454157782,28.1454157782516,9.092157051796928,2.300913518123666,3502,132,690,73,67,1153,346,875,0.155,0.677,0.16899999999999998,0.9051,5,0,6,0,1,1,91.0,6,0,1,11,47,61,14,4,54,1,70,25,7,3,5,128,134,64,0,16,33,3,7,1,5,4,4,3,2,4,42,46,11,1,17,11,2,9,28,37,1,2,58,14,90,24,102,68,23,124,1,12,2,4,47,58,7,14,61,478,132,9,0.0,0.055467441281610616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08299633048514114,0.05003038568202249,0.04687788668101032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06367083189340629,0.09817801784507768,0.03581290880131094,0.0,0.0,0.09820120832022528,0.04796691311361916,0.11557285463331078,0.041674765594249485,0.08753034021552646,0.0,0.0,0.07199480993073235,0.0,0.057075280817867065,0.051702857007379116,0.07967125929270215,0.0,0.0,0.041403556674658316,0.10221845971526022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434082935345309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09904691357177657,0.0,0.0,0.05058976485693474,0.0,0.0,0.051799273460241664,0.0,0.09057429837806648,0.0,0.3225695815672798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047916550110311006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18344126553576093,0.0,0.0,0.039107446971501765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927614632814726,0.0,0.0,0.0447331915402252,0.0,0.04579349295215917,0.04413247574707546,0.0,0.09468312437766947,0.0,0.08989838351549273,0.0,0.0,0.0398203280057423,0.05660819140044492,0.0,0.18084355228918594,0.0865583674918247,0.12229303053289595,0.0,0.1596343074795649,0.11779716174742587,0.14976709658839932,0.10322614288969614,0.0,0.04635364325006496,0.04139784351625125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09609021688844206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06275744772063925,0.0,0.09391737533436753,0.0,0.09220556182230616,0.05401756375962069,0.05011581273857866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09291219116011724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718395493848766,0.03816000654492015,0.05280871316626395,0.0,0.0,0.04787092376029733,0.0,0.022871164524906503,0.28152212889642125,0.0,0.0828585901166273,0.03931232847596521,0.0,0.051103477592350434,0.07959990410038091,0.042251848458680616,0.08859388620594584,0.03124899378944667,0.047462481538235436,0.0470313845798538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03736682929102733,0.0,0.1376559626159387,0.06942460942276729,0.036106172405629765,0.0,0.09957534921214224,0.04393216879044276,0.045868199178500366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0356044815537588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05069546280904273,0.044689668087515434,0.03245522945222246,0.0,0.04891111265867672,0.0,0.13276429687440144,0.0,0.044835280717468916,0.14288130817712338,0.10094774126762776,0.17918033826621094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02999052092513115,0.0,0.0924471985865084,0.1507835255549846,0.05303162028297385,0.039979265184276115,0.044531240824847516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03730503752952884,0.0,0.0,0.10577395546220934,0.048054336953884697,0.03872537808739019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06627098529001202,0.0,0.07477212434065167,0.0,0.16087730514861184,0.0,0.05359131908500683,0.0,0.0,0.08824408754042776,0.0,0.03519862325485231,0.0,0.08183574590154567,0.0,0.0,0.054355158398219215,0.06220285073569059,0.0599935895499088,0.04599493720117337,0.07433085221896324,0.19108508349760686,0.0,0.0,0.08946638308045039,0.0,0.0,0.1018413077546166,0.045730893138121634,0.0487354698916025,0.0,0.0,0.10311895571109976,0.0,0.08283708654840782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04209179239231958,0.0,0.08448547836605516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06816292136496653,0.09508464684118956,0.0,0.09976687809628104,0.0,0.0,0.12058782541989567

alcoholism,DreyaNova,2019/01/07,"One of my good friends got sober. What are some fun sober activities we can enjoy together? I met one of my closest girlfriends over a summer of heavy drinking in our favourite bar. We bonded immediately but our friendship has mostly been centered around being drunk together. She's sober now and I don't want her to think I've forgotten about her. We still meet up for coffee and a chat but I think she's become a little isolated and I want to be able to go out and do more with her. All I can think of is to go to the art gallery together... So my embarrassing question is what are some other fun sober activities girlfriends can enjoy together?

alcoholism,flutel00p,2019/01/07,"After telling myself I needed to stop drinking, I’m finally doing it I’m hungover today and wondering again how I ended up here. I used to drink maybe once or twice a week max, and even then it was one beer or glass of wine usually. Somehow, with the stress of working at a job I hate, I have let myself spiral into alcoholism. I told my boyfriend that I need help and I don’t want to keep booze in the house, that we can use the money we have spent on that to buy a heavier weight set or go out of town for a weekend. He said he has noticed my lack of control which is so embarrassing to me.

alcoholism,dontplay37,2019/01/07,"Just out of the blue Alcohol has been in my life since 16 im now 37. the pints turn to fifths daily, ive been through  it all from being homeless several times sleeping where ever i can just to drink.  Push all my family and friends away and now i am alone more then ever.  Tried to quit many times and failed horribly.  No one has ever told me or reconized i had a problem noone seemed to care.  I felt no love, loneliness, ashamed, and guilt.  Till one day a stranger came up to me and asked if i was ok.  My normal response was yea im good.  They said it will be ok just take it one day at a time we are here for you and take your time.  This was my boss a woman who has no knowledge of my life but notice i was struggling with alcohol.  I cried when she turned around to leave i couldnt hold back the tears of emotion knowing someone did care and out of juat pure love came up and said something so supportive in my struggle.  Somehow that struck me in such a way it made me more determined to quit.  I still cry at times thinking about that moment.  I havnt had a drink since and that was 28 days ago.  Longest i have ever been sober.  I was a extremely heavy drinker and thought i hide it well.  Just remember maybe you can be that stranger who says just a few caring words out of the blue will or can make a world of difference in someones life.

I won't bore anyone with the details of my mediocre life, but long story short; i'm an Alcoholic, and its pretty bad. It's not really where i wanted to be at almost 28 years old, but that's a story for another time. Anyways, i've come to a point now where the drinking has passed the point of harming my work life, family and, myself. And when i  say 'myself' i mean that i'm starting experience some problems, particularly that of Delirium Tremens. After a lengthy conversation with the wife, we agreed that its time to stop, but since i've been experiencing some of the lovely fuckery that comes with Delirium Tremens, i'm honestly pretty terrified as i know going cold-turkey can kick that shit into over-drive and literally kill you. And since i can't go to the Doctor until next year (No health insurance). I'm trying to find a work around at home. One severe symptom i'm aware of when the drinking ceases is a drastic increase in Blood Pressure, which is something i don't want. So i'm trying to figure out a way to manage that first, before moving on to an additional step. I've scoured the web and have found recipes for meals and beverages that aid in lowering blood pressure. I've found one beverage recipe in particular that has me interested. It's a mixture of garlic, honey, water, cayenne pepper and lemon juice.    It's said that daily consumption of this mixture can help to slightly lower blood pressure, and keep it there, since it kind of acts like a control i guess. Anyone else ever heard of this, or know of anything that works?",6.7969308722403206,7.056387022801308,7.089679695982628,74.61090752804922,64.76547231270358,9.688671733622876,33.01646760767282,9.444778638647367,2.99427846543612,1284,49,229,22,18,417,179,307,0.152,0.7390000000000001,0.108,-0.9499,2,0,4,0,0,0,38.0,1,1,0,6,11,14,2,3,18,0,12,16,4,2,1,45,36,19,1,3,5,1,0,1,1,1,7,3,1,0,21,20,5,3,7,2,0,9,5,9,0,3,5,6,15,5,40,29,4,41,0,0,1,1,11,15,1,6,17,137,36,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10467281951742843,0.0,0.1144747604462671,0.10726151267636952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11232079186172553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14979643063903347,0.1097533191714241,0.08814759715776438,0.09535622688134328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943764554121075,0.0,0.0,0.0911480912814724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18454243462209494,0.0,0.0,0.12014005121571494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11043221331231487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10963808334702536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20986641060126845,0.0,0.0,0.08948193308324666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968928359405106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10478030629254036,0.10097972502463676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09790236779609174,0.09111307952573144,0.0,0.2348950126257535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12175333622166737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11800069310802848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138596297453457,0.0,0.0,0.07179780543467609,0.0,0.10744639379231406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952098990284446,0.118508327662137,0.11154515453854587,0.11773664652564356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15131883671182134,0.05233161896364566,0.0,0.0,0.09479456459521844,0.08995072341583353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09667665289371233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668106504186684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11384768678161568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139194120934925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11240054962663126,0.0,0.14516956922553956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20251907413638529,0.0,0.0,0.2179515948538557,0.0,0.10249584337641876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06862145177898943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10189214127188342,0.08518318994350907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12101094212972947,0.10995335407092093,0.2658231584253843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824633695363955,0.0,0.0,0.07581747634156494,0.0,0.0,0.08955403245455441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2226697227315837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1249207648514729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14544988791420105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12635995118333504,0.08502394192013024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2339458507525396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13795878484142035

alcoholism,ehdubs83,2019/01/08,"Drinking to deal with PTSD, can't stop, and keep making things worse It's been about 4.5 years since I relapsed due to a series of shocking events in my life. I wasn't able to afford treatment for my PTSD at first, and now that I've found a good EMDR therapist, her efforts are all towards keeping me from drinking so we can commence treatment. Problem is, I can't go more than two days without a drink. My anxiety gets so unbearable, I cave in. I did a medical detox 1 month ago, but when I got out I received word that I have to move out of my house (due to lease terms, not due to my drinking.) I relapsed, and I made things worse. When I drink, I tend to rage against people. My doctor says the rage is a symptom of PTSD. In any case, the repercussions of lashing out at people make me so ashamed that I want to drink even more. Can anyone here relate?

alcoholism,Althaaz64,2019/01/08,"Trying to get home I am 22 years old. I joined the Air Force in May of last year. In Tech School, I started drinking a lot, had a couple of humiliating experiences (I was basically the “class drunk”, and I’d drink in class, after work, etc), then made it to my first duty station: Hawaii! I learned from Tech School not to drink socially, cuz I always overdid it, so drinking alone every day became the norm, at work, in my room, everywhere. I started neglecting my PT, and went down a bitter and dark road because I was simply incompetant at life in general; no friends, and too self righteous to make any. I enrolled myself in ADAPT after planning to drink until I died, and they put me in an outpatient program, where everyone else cared WAY more about getting sober, until the last week where I started getting serious. Eventually, I let them push me up to an inpatient program, but even there I just wanted to drink again. They caught me drinking when I came back, and called me a treatment failure, so now I’m getting administratively separated and going back home. The only trouble is my Commander gave me a direct order not to drink anymore, for my safety. I, being the idiot I am, violated it and they got me (turns out they can test back up to 3 weeks). I was lucky and got off with an LoR, but now if I drink again, it could effect my discharge and delay my return home. But all I want to do is get drunk still, and even now I have booze lying in wait for when I can get away with it again, and for when I get back home. My parents know about this all, and they will not let me drink. But I KNOW I can get away with it; I know them too well, and am already planning backup plan after backup plan to make sure I can keep alcohol in secret. Even worse is I’m so starved for a high of ANY sort, I’m experimenting now, and thinking about getting drugs that won’t show up on a drug test. Every bone in my body wants to drink or use NOW, and I’m not sure how much longer I can “white-knuckle it”. I am probably 3 weeks sober or so, occasionally suicidal, and DYING to drink.

alcoholism,nomnombubbles,2019/01/08,"Dry heaving all day long and night So to preface, I have been drinking a third of one of those huge liters of vodka for 5-6 days a week for about six months now.  

The most prominent withdrawal symptom up until now has been shaky hands when I am completely sober.

This past week, I have been waking up dry heaving continuously and have been unable to keep any food or water down without being drunk.  

This scares me because I want to stop drinking for good but I am afraid I might need to detox medically since I literally can't sleep because of this.  I am so tired but my body won't let me sleep.  

I have not experienced the other more extreme symptoms of withdrawal such as hallucinations so I was thinking about going to the walk in clinic by my apartment and finally come clean about my alcoholism and see if they could get me on an outpatient program to get through these physical withdrawal symptoms and finally sober.  

Does my symptoms sound similar to any of yours? Did you have to detox in the ER or were you able to at home? I am not afraid of going to the hospital but as I am an American, it costs an arm and a leg to sit in the emergency room and am hoping my withdrawal symptoms are mild enough to get outpatient detox.  

Thank you in advance.",7.180680958385878,6.6241835245901655,7.302131147540983,76.13996847414883,64.1639344262295,10.95031525851198,35.162673392181595,10.389873798559362,3.454895712484237,996,40,194,21,13,322,140,244,0.054000000000000006,0.846,0.1,0.7618,0,0,4,0,0,0,14.0,0,4,1,1,10,7,0,4,12,0,26,24,7,0,1,28,39,20,0,5,9,0,1,0,0,2,12,1,3,0,7,8,6,2,1,4,1,5,5,4,1,3,7,4,25,3,40,27,4,34,0,0,1,0,5,12,0,7,16,139,32,1,0.11330386211822213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210873706995846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15410102319075614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13813796539768305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12585504828603986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760124460526064,0.11879694373476915,0.0,0.0,0.0904639142822293,0.0,0.0,0.1461432353432187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09915297328090904,0.0,0.0,0.22198929929008365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11707317759961525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24823768540297114,0.0,0.0,0.13700747982044367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17758977453695818,0.0,0.1287863918606256,0.09503390387943716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11365301193681365,0.11253630055792993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10070967864867217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11586087558740454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002703525100168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11414172091325052,0.0,0.12019749244657488,0.0,0.0,0.09043806176086652,0.0,0.0,0.0840133780926378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10632799918383552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767776292983067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10816135699107453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11343693199889986,0.0,0.09028850860774268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09372612559399776,0.0,0.2267713776247905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09472710214193653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5888304800740076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10431497338449697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.072600539835923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302261218334502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06682955347916973,0.0,0.18177104761526164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922087982421758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,moschles,2019/01/08,"Vertigo (BPPV) and liquor. Anyone else find a connection? I suffered from BPPV that was quite severe.  Vomiting, lasting several days,  completely limited mobility.  I nearly went to the E-R because of it.   It went away and I hoped that it would never return again in my life.   

It returned recently in now what is my 2nd episode.      It was much more minor this time, but lasted for 2/3 days before subsiding.  

Unlike before , I now have a theory as to its cause.  My hypothesis is that the BPPV episodes are brought on by a particular type of vodka , when I mix it with salt.  (salt is placed along the rim of the glass as part of a mixed drink.)     The BPPV episode  *DOES NOT* come on while drunk.  (Being dizzy and stumbling is part of inebriation for anyone).  Rather it occurs roughly several days after drinking, as if something has to ""go through my system"" before it starts screwing with the portions of my inner ear. 

The particular brand is REYKA vodka.  I mix it with lime seltzer, lime slices and salt (along the rim). 

Has anyone else made a connection between alcohol and vertigo?

alcoholism,saaaaaack,2019/01/08,"Possible Alcohol Withdrawals after months of constant drinking Hello to anyone who reads this,

I've been drinking a handle (1.75 Liters) of Majorska 100 proof vodka, the frequency being a handle every 2.5 - 3 days. I've been drinking day and night for about 3 months now. I'm broke now so I'm on my last handle. I'll be dry by friday (within the next 3 days). Do you think I'll face withdrawals? My dad is nervous I could die through a seizure or heart arrythmia and is pressuring me to go to a detox clinic. While I know the delirium tremens are a possibility, I think I could perhaps handle whatever withdrawal symptoms on my own. Thoughts?

Thanks to anyone who reads and considers responding.",4.058512820512823,6.525273646153848,4.973461538461539,78.70070512820514,74.07692307692308,8.025641025641027,30.06410256410256,8.841846274778883,2.8271025641025638,554,25,95,12,12,180,85,130,0.095,0.872,0.033,-0.8205,0,0,5,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,0,4,4,0,2,8,0,10,9,2,0,1,11,18,6,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,3,4,0,4,6,0,1,0,3,0,0,3,0,9,1,14,11,1,17,0,1,0,0,6,3,0,1,13,53,12,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658482947157573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170214856020783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1677026094685624,0.0,0.2478092608723503,0.0,0.0,0.30024939296992553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16106017527886204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4560741535599206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13075220351784758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881966605983679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18389799318760172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528701862187041,0.12649856533269288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2477384426432097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16504371930610529,0.14563300237914947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34990128908572765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31045909062471405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16129928403387142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14287584534361175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19887583085942,0.0,0.12320157957240907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Not when my wife told me she was leaving me, but not for anyone else.

Not when she later confessed to having sex with someone else.

alcoholism,robsterLA,2019/01/09,"AA is Harmful: Please Beware!  

AA begins and ends with shame and condemnation. We are told that this organization is the premiere way for people suffering from substance addiction to receive help. Nothing is further from the truth. While some recent articles have finally questioned the actual results of the organization, I want to go one step farther by acknowledging how, far from being a benign failure, AA is actually dangerous and harmful to overwhelming majority of addicts and non-addicts alike. This is because AA has almost singularly defined what it means to be a substance user. In short, AA invented the Addict. And they still control the very definition of that dirty word. The articles that have come out recently, that are critical of AA, have mainly focused on the ineffective success rate of the AA program. Most authors site - at most - a 5% to 7% success rate for AA participants. This number is shockingly low and researchers from our best institutions have noted that the ""AA success rate"" is actually far lower than the rate of those people who just decide to quit on their own - so-called spontaneous remission.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you may ask, what about the people who do claim that AA has saved their lives, isn't the program helping them stay sober? And, almost every author, who is critical of AA's abysmal success rate, eventually cedes the point that AA does, in fact, help ""some"" people? They do? They help ""some"" people? Really? Who are these lucky ones?While it is true that some people, usually the proverbial old-timers, seem to stay sober (mostly) from AA, they do not do so in spite of all the other people failed by the program. Rather, they stay sober by exploiting and demonizing the very people whom they and the program have failed.

&amp;#x200B;

After attending countless AA meetings, I believe that old-timers, even those who diligently work their programs, actually survive by wielding power over and exploiting other substance abusers, controlling new members, and ultimately by demonizing those people who choose use drugs and alcohol - usually by turning other users into scapegoats and pariahs. Their rigid definition of the drug user - The Addict - serves not to help the user, but rather to create a boogieman or enemy out there. And this is how the old tiers stay sober: they construct an external enemy and they try to stay sober by rallying, one day at a time, against that enemy. Their boogieman - The Addict - assumes a contradictory, tripartite identity: one part blameless victim, one part perpetually diseased person, and one part morally flawed, condemned soul. But users and people with substance issues are not boogie-men, they are not our enemies, Rather, they are our loved ones, people in our families, our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends, and sometime our selves. 

Am I overreacting? No. Most people who have attended more than a couple of meetings and then decided at AA wasn't for them are left with a couple of inescapable observations.  The first is how AA always tends to facilitate an ""us versus them"" mentality in their members. People who believe in AA, especially those pesky old-timers, believe that they have found the one and only route to true sobriety and salvation - irrespective of any actual medical or psychological research. No other methods of recovery or harm reduction are ever acknowledged as valid within the program or at a meeting. Far from it, those brave enough to mention alternatives are quickly given the cold shoulder by more established members. The message is always the same: without AA your disease will progress and you will die. Even those folks who achieve abstinence apart from AA are still derided as ""dry drunks"" and as being in ""denial"" and simply bidding their time till relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

And, why do adherents to the program cultivate such as an ""us versus them,"" you're in or you're out, with us or against us, you're among the chosen people or you're among the condemned people kind of attitude? One reason: Control. Most of these old-timers achieve sobriety, and the appearance of control in other areas of their life, mainly by exerting interpersonal control over others - usually the most vulnerable and/or newcomers to their AA meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

But you may ask, isn't their need for control - to give unchallenged directions - benign or even beneficial if it helps other addicts stay sober? After all, aren't these sorry people just in need of some Good Orderly Direction (another one of their crazy acronyms for god)? But the fact is that power and control are never just neutral, never simply benign. And covering up the need for power and control with talk of spirituality and a higher power makes it only more dangerous - especially for the vulnerable newcomer.

&amp;#x200B;

AA seeks to control its members in numerous ways. You're forced to ""share"" to the group, revealing your inmost conflicts and foibles for others to judge. This is one of the first steps of many into lifelong shame and condemnation.

&amp;#x200B;

You are told to get a sponsor. This sponsor chimes in on almost every aspect of your life, even those areas that have seemingly nothing to do with your substance use. Sponsors receive no special training or qualifications and are usually ill-equipped to advise people on their most pressing problems. These relationships always involve the sponsor exerting their power over the newcomer in countless ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Newcomers are told how many meeting they need to attend (often 90 meetings in 90 days), what book to read (always read the Big Book) and how to think (think like the Home Group). However, the advice of the sponsor almost never stops there. Newcomers are advised on who to associate with, and who not to associate with. They are frequently given career advice, and are given directions on how to deal with spouses, families, and loved ones. Unsurprisingly, much of this advice is hogwash! And frequently, the demands of a sponsor lead to frayed social relationships with non-AA members and isolation outside of the AA organization.There has not yet been a formal study as to how many people get divorced as a result of following the directions of their AA group or sponsor, but the anecdotal evidence suggests a staggeringly large number. Newcomers are often encouraged to drop their relationships with non-AA members and are encouraged to only have romantic connections with those in the program.

&amp;#x200B;

But the need of AAers to perpetuate their beliefs harms far more than just the unwitting newcomer. AA has ingrained in our collective consciousness the very idea of what it means to be a substance user: The Addict - and this is where their harm is most insidious and pervasive. Without any medical backup, they contend that someone with a substance problem is once and forever an addict. This idea is found in the very preface of their organization's holy text, the Big Book, under the disingenuous title ""The Doctor's Opinion."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with this idea is that it leads people into accepting the idea that they are terminally ill or at least terminally deficient and powerless - but this simply is not usually the case. The truth is that for most people substance abuse is not a lifelong condition that needs to be managed with constant meetings and sponsorship. Their rigid disease model actually serves to keep people away from other helpful alternatives, such as behavioral therapy, membership in positive social groups, or harm reduction. 

&amp;#x200B;

They also perpetuate the idea that the addict is a person of uniquely flawed character - one of the condemned who needs AA's saving. At its face this is contradictory: is the addict somebody who has a disease or is the addict somebody who has deeply-seated character flaws? And it is this contradiction is at the heart of AA's religiosity and thinly-veiled religious ideology.

&amp;#x200B;

AA has its roots in the Oxford Group, a radical christian cult from the early twentieth century. In fact, the 12 Steps themselves are almost directly taken from the Oxford Group's cult methodology. Central to the Oxford Group's ideology is the old-line protestant idea of Total Depravity - the idea that all human beings are inexorably into sin, brokenness, moral failure, and rebellion. This radical and detrimental belief is the underpinning of virtually all AA thought: e.g. the addict is hopeless and powerless and needs the intervention of a higher power to get right. 

&amp;#x200B;

The doctrine of Total Depravity is much more than just a dusty old theological formulation. It has real consequences for those belonging to a group operating on such a notions - and what a shame it is! I believe that telling people over and over again that they are powerless and morally flawed only leads to greater and greater problems and dysfunctions with one's self-image and ultimately one's behavior in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let me conclude with my original point: AA is not a harmless organization. It's an organization run by power-seeking individuals who often mess up the lives of those whom they purport to help. Their most harmful invention is the identity of the modern addict - a caste or class of person they claim to be inexorably diseased as well as morally flawed. And this classification of the addict is not just limited to AA meetings and their written propaganda. That would be bad enough! Rather, their model of the addict has been perpetuated for almost a hundred years by television, media, the courts, the prison industry, religious authorities, celebrities, and by a multi-billion dollar recovery industry. In fact, over 95% of private recovery programs are still based on the 12 Steps and their assumptions about the drug user - virtually without any empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

The damage is not limited to the people who weave in and out of their meeting rooms - that would be bad enough. The deepest harm from AA stems from their need to demonize and scapegoat the substance user - to cast the unrepentant user as inevitably among the condemned!  But we are not condemned. Their organization only thrives so long as they are able to label non-adherents as depraved addicts who are, at best, in ""denial"" or ""dry-drunks.""  So long as AA propaganda dominates are collective conscious, we are doing all doing a disservice for people who struggle with substance issues.

&amp;#x200B;

AA can only thrive so long as they cast the unrepentant user as outsider, condemned to a long and painful road to death. But that is not the truth. Drug users are not all suffering from ""character flaws."" Drug use does not make you condemned for life and most users do learn to quit or moderate without AA and then go on to live happy, normal lifespans. We need to cut through the fear and labeling that AA and the 12-Step industry thrives on. What we need is a new model for understanding the substance user, not as somebody who is inherently flawed and diseased, not as somebody who is morally disordered, but as someone who could benefit from harm reduction, psychological therapy, and real medical treatment - as full human beings!",10.767863597807649,10.679917949894511,9.826447213884908,59.42610857366568,56.7373417721519,12.818556701030927,43.33331158380096,12.058725423621393,5.6980986841532895,9027,451,1275,237,97,2859,626,1896,0.13699999999999998,0.7859999999999999,0.077,-0.9992,15,1,8,0,3,1,332.0,18,9,51,40,47,75,6,8,139,0,125,37,3,31,21,308,177,133,2,25,60,1,1,1,2,6,31,0,3,5,108,102,2,16,34,6,1,18,31,41,37,16,14,2,84,34,257,145,48,164,14,8,0,2,163,87,0,51,49,944,192,35,0.01986369068557231,0.04707045065533039,0.11630458042373495,0.36812403224838014,0.0,0.058231705932673634,0.0,0.0212282444087928,0.1193437015045555,0.0,0.0,0.015884986264698392,0.06611272758992001,0.3228345083828293,0.36204837558391495,0.040523972463500375,0.02082881163091883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03713973877974044,0.0,0.01866259127180776,0.0,0.03317070403107729,0.012108721473813613,0.0,0.0,0.0895183090401593,0.041691435764361136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017110810674246073,0.0,0.021465592925706045,0.20050936332994285,0.015859540689207762,0.04395759186030135,0.0,0.025620874420128247,0.020478592885093967,0.0,0.0,0.0206153748593102,0.0,0.022765510435121303,0.020331329113326357,0.034765699155987366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151778744542378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017593334091661292,0.061573507132247074,0.0,0.0524791214355677,0.017967845442853642,0.03347203223309805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03745143951031664,0.0223521744560028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02175970221651434,0.0,0.033792090299553434,0.0,0.043559023133020826,0.015346638149657966,0.0,0.03113387561883768,0.01905506210470814,0.022577986351084448,0.016660721320636746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02114526809861916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023538569102344947,0.106513705263278,0.0,0.01992490134397148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15696582277089702,0.0,0.041465064653758925,0.0,0.017655760962793202,0.0,0.02068497714194632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02158195805024885,0.02031196953221644,0.0420909365110294,0.009704395915198543,0.0,0.05262000838513163,0.07031496473135493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035855512747983626,0.0,0.026518335553411054,0.06041599387690836,0.0,0.0432747647941074,0.0,0.06003173579839762,0.020017928221147025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029204196398877943,0.16201542446585204,0.04596030844320292,0.038368952485233934,0.0,0.0,0.01946219941099268,0.03811949387901392,0.0,0.14590521359454886,0.021154182299401247,0.1884421123885905,0.09064339115136627,0.021136367383773804,0.0,0.0,0.06453132392984504,0.0,0.3305035691872975,0.0520326255851252,0.0,0.021804367418396725,0.03755521642019567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07602747734427481,0.0,0.0,0.02225187958701401,0.04225496022824431,0.03973813216474886,0.045218457431007365,0.01272518889204698,0.020423182317780297,0.0392259963570057,0.06397851005275865,0.0,0.01696348331211676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036166315944193964,0.020722161495019653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040497062320775434,0.033660881315545475,0.0,0.019645698001286675,0.022235775458189083,0.0,0.12703230793605785,0.04758950712141999,0.016606934850329585,0.0,0.02076584237419257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01596568214983287,0.017361741186797574,0.0,0.045431722873521534,0.0,0.0,0.025455701861276915,0.0,0.015769551608563803,0.023165355556652518,0.0,0.0,0.05694182306948317,0.0,0.013486142088602479,0.02160599146353304,0.0,0.020678802534357717,0.09557429657206973,0.05146755317392659,0.10938524484537883,0.0655585004382998,0.011716119416830078,0.0473006192625333,0.0,0.0,0.03571968691935953,0.0,0.017923891244284867,0.0,0.0,0.07659155593374632,0.0,0.014461003394510903,0.0,0.0,0.02822119189180548,0.0,0.36204837558391495,0.012791565544827615

alcoholism,Cohle282,2019/01/09,"Newbie here I don't even know what to say. I'm 25, have been struggling with depression and related mental issues for a few years, maybe since childhood, which led me to numbing myself with alcohol from time to time when I couldn't cope with it anymore. My drinking habit started to change and intensify last year. In the last weeks I started drinking almost regularly as much as I could in the afternoon and evening. Eventually I started to notice that I had problems not drinking during the daytime. The first physical withdrawel symptoms made me realize that at some point, my unhealthy lifestyle might've developed into a problem.

I stopped drinking a couple of days ago after I had an argument with my gf over nothing where I became somewhat sociopathic and started to verbally attack her in a way that I knew would hurt her the most. In retrospective, I was shocked and ashamed by my behaviour. I wasn't acting like myself anymore.

I'm not feeling good. Withdrawel symptoms come and go, mostly in the evening, but the worst is the mental pressure. I'm feeling like shit and I miss the relieving feeling of being drunk, but I keep on reminding me of the reasons why I don't want to drink anymore.

Guess I just wanted to tell my story. Can't sleep atm and trying to distract myself. It's probably only a small alcohol problem (comparing myself to the other stories I read on here), but well, this is new to me. I feel lost.",6.149700374531838,7.3755954494382046,6.502865168539326,74.86006554307117,66.41573033707866,8.929588014981274,36.5561797752809,9.150863307647796,3.545058426966292,1143,58,190,20,18,369,157,267,0.227,0.7509999999999999,0.022,-0.9924,0,0,7,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,2,9,21,2,4,17,0,15,13,2,3,0,46,37,14,0,8,6,0,4,2,1,1,5,1,0,0,9,14,8,2,8,7,1,4,7,16,1,1,8,5,33,5,34,25,7,38,0,4,0,0,5,13,1,6,22,138,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08257156624747053,0.19909734715171346,0.09327594371935387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27713834156568234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597120243803193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854000457361944,0.08024019667510851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07437243555001746,0.10306834326510196,0.0,0.06007383406893811,0.0,0.08022967828249339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45625609352746294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18457344477246965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1883970973504162,0.06654614618214816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923306567176032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05293910673869216,0.07812952764004387,0.0,0.0,0.10261486841415814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971865328022493,0.0,0.0,0.09722405928935646,0.0,0.08279571079794278,0.0,0.0,0.051192625113195896,0.15185883472242884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09101645172436704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1016838735116932,0.0,0.0,0.08814047441874301,0.0,0.0,0.09358136835316876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877459260198162,0.09881708448263164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06847572880668652,0.0,0.0,0.08996453622933673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08937962508729712,0.10605152198091654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084452505642695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805655117990316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043110408483337,0.26739497550511715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09317488227486914,0.0,0.0,0.09577337959660966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407636003586067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09561680243143617,0.07705437345266132,0.0,0.09321694623102036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2637272766240693,0.0,0.0,0.07787729897373045,0.0,0.09738026490687778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19363635666953494,0.0,0.0,0.08141692138220985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10863264875651588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324251458212116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10988418306684647,0.07393787597670967,0.07471905030247415,0.0,0.08375274433655659,0.0,0.0840530928665683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06617085627663359,0.0,0.0,0.11997067288510972
alcoholism,xxxtenplates,2019/01/09,"Just looking for advice.. Hi, I use to have a really good career job. I was a firefighter for 7 years. I suffered from depression and PTSD. In result of that I struggled with substance abuse. I have now lost my job, fiancee, license, had a heart attack from a overdose, lost a lot of other things. Since then I have went to rehab and I am almost 2 years clean. However, I am still struggling big time. But since I got a criminal record I can't even get a second job at Walmart that I applied here the other day. Most of my friends have vanished, I do not have any support and I am barely living. Is there anyway that I can some how start elevate my self that would not cost any money. I love to read and learn things. I am just having such a hard time. Literally struggling everyday but trying my hardest and trying to keep my head up high. It seems like when you make a simple mistake the world wont let you forget. the consequences that i take full responsibility for keep dragging on. I am at the point where I am trying so hard and nothing changes. No one wants to give me a chance, nobody wants to even talk to me. I was assistant captain in a fire hall who was once respected, now I am struggling every single day just trying to keep my head from going under water. My dream is to go to university and be able to work in mental health and addictions. But I exhausted all resources. Its sad but I have accepted the fact that my life isn't going to get better. But I am slighty optimistic sometimes and can't give up. Do anyone got any advice? I am not looking for any pity or handouts. I just want to not have to live everyday struggling. thanks and I love you all.",2.285391566265062,4.477185295180725,3.6682981927710863,87.2417243975904,78.57831325301207,6.318674698795181,23.62801204819277,7.413659706084162,1.076718072289157,1306,44,259,18,32,428,178,332,0.14,0.728,0.132,0.3697,4,0,0,0,2,0,37.0,0,3,0,4,17,24,1,5,16,0,33,11,3,4,3,48,62,20,0,5,14,0,3,1,2,2,5,0,1,1,13,11,1,3,3,2,2,4,9,14,0,2,9,5,40,10,34,49,7,34,0,6,2,2,14,16,0,6,15,184,53,7,0.08379100976931138,0.09927864496932086,0.0,0.0913445686661148,0.0,0.16375920997173418,0.0,0.0,0.08390459269768104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2279230398371549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05858862226871935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09532437007551477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741063389367724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08863977804452534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807653888783926,0.0,0.07216907393413853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11068634340159224,0.0,0.07059753960726299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06473672629518334,0.0,0.08755468851614676,0.16075994338052513,0.14286108544943266,0.07027992355696644,0.13403064993386635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501205730433999,0.0,0.17198749946043432,0.08906592514051567,0.0,0.09929275001461646,0.0,0.08852980226694332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2494489440933999,0.22343189834191798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568198450372044,0.059184068194617995,0.040936054925899516,0.0,0.14797799349752871,0.0,0.14072668980231512,0.0,0.1829355705387708,0.07123612011100358,0.15124931547248385,0.0,0.05593114966886939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08444162999164109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08039973372968462,0.0,0.0,0.08923469076159017,0.05677895674806261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920958787983044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09794720646487907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381368480654844,0.0,0.05367866644964928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07628018832374016,0.08741229732959936,0.0,0.0,0.1386255783071554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08287145119242098,0.0,0.05930770798467905,0.0,0.06691560863903184,0.0,0.0,0.4379827819479102,0.0,0.0,0.0950850449178249,0.0,0.0,0.06300041142669226,0.06734803970553384,0.0,0.07714350411838365,0.0,0.0,0.11133404735429267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771842325187304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2275543817881101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236852941149498,0.0,0.0,0.1482663255364334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07767510552235635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061000853058168575,0.0,0.0,0.05952272925860237,0.0,0.0,0.10791732619053887

alcoholism,GarthbrooksXV,2019/01/09,"What does alcoholism look like? Is my habit unhealthy? I started drinking about a month ago as a way to improve my social life, mental health, and explore something new(tastes, feelings, etc...).

When I started drinking I said I would have 1 or 2 drinks a day only. I've been true to that goal for the most part, but I noticed some things about myself that kind of worry me if I'm headed down the wrong path:

I crave drinking. I love drinking and I always wish I could have another glass. Sometimes even in the morning I put a little kahlua in my coffee.

I have a hard time really feeling alcohol but once I do the experience is lovely. If I drink 2 drinks pretty fast within each other I can feel nice and relaxed and a little lighter than usa, but that feeling goes away within like 45 min or so.

Just wanted to run this by some people experienced with alcohol and ask some advice about what is a normal healthy drinking habit and how do I judge whether it is becoming harmful to me? What amount of drinking in one day is actually harmful? I'm 27 year old male 210 lb, kind of muscular, used to be athlete but now kind of coach potato :D.",4.4632343049327385,5.701214008968607,5.138001681614352,83.0498724775785,70.34529147982063,7.368721973094171,29.632567264574,7.6454224807358475,1.8658881165919283,896,35,170,10,16,289,141,223,0.052000000000000005,0.758,0.19,0.9865,0,0,13,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,0,1,9,13,0,0,11,0,15,18,2,2,1,35,31,19,0,7,10,0,5,2,0,1,5,1,0,1,10,8,12,0,5,11,0,3,0,3,0,1,2,8,21,10,24,26,8,26,0,0,1,2,6,9,0,8,15,110,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.07910982422257734,0.0,0.0,0.07921786061616724,0.07186111890438733,0.2599083217279226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06745434581499543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08500595355146791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757868227330307,0.0,0.07616523664011539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08953227530388179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06472550633532896,0.0,0.0,0.10456318389631228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07094239124164094,0.0,0.0,0.7147343181212676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041127841136952,0.0535440744078701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07929920811791749,0.0,0.0,0.1639599056818718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07262022473742928,0.0,0.08319826263409241,0.08617056768470241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532568209793586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057260110936639685,0.07921060913411619,0.1625011215201766,0.0,0.0,0.06807597141961436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14633249871513224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169659924512829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06470700926333592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07829513873793661,0.0,0.0,0.0794285746328615,0.0,0.09229546413376104,0.08506631534866119,0.08633384706849265,0.05493318491675404,0.061655204935157686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08778780120853125,0.0,0.056201740223994115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08247441476117537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0814948559406316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05193367893755745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07711340424736449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08263772940124474,0.0,0.06240943679544213,0.08017746385994233,0.0,0.11475946288225493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05385739859558705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047270895079028936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07001597133872763,0.0,0.0,0.04781549329833632,0.06434731395521932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09322319802773882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823276050000752,0.0,0.057587762797777366,0.08863417987016907,0.0,0.05220457344479842
alcoholism,nickslumlord,2019/01/09,"How do I know when I have a problem...? I'm sure this is asked a lot here but maybe someone can point me in the right direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually have a beer or two every other day with a whiskey on the rocks or two on the weekends. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said during times of high stress I'll have a few more whiskeys on the rocks. I'm able to cut back when that stress goes away, but I've noticed I've been drinking more and more.

I don't usually get drunk.

alcoholism,holding-the-world,2019/01/09,"Anxiety without alcohol. Hey guys , first post on reddit. I feel like I needed to post this. I’m a 20 year old male that works full time , but not at a “career” type job (40 hours / week) . For me it’s just money for now until I find what’s next. I’ve been having trouble with alcohol, I think? 

I’ve been drinking consistently for the past 2 or 3 months for the most part by myself in order to get to sleep (or that’s just what I tell myself).  

Once I start drinking it’s hard to stop. I get a feeling of euphoria , and I don’t care what happens to me anymore and I don’t care what happens in the future. 

On my way home from work 4/5 p.m , I get severe anxiety knowing that if I don’t stop to get more drinks, I won’t be able to fall asleep that night. It’s almost as if I have no control over it and I stop to buy more drinks almost every time whether or not I want to. 

I don’t want it to get any worse than it is. 

Backstory: I dropped out of college because I felt like it was a waist of time. I landed a job with a small company with the skills that I have acquired since I was 14 in the programming field (boosted my spirit). 

After the company went under after a few months, and I wasn’t getting payed anymore, i felt worthless. I lost my girlfriend of 3 years because of my self esteem due to me having almost no money to my name, and no hope. 

I’ve been severely depressed in the past and drinking is a way for me to not hear myself think. 

Any tips?

alcoholism,Longwave-Citypop,2019/01/10,"I started young and stopped myself when I was still able to I had my first experiences with alcohol at the age of 13/14, my first strong alcohol I drank with 16, I got shitfaced drunk by the time I was 17.
At the time I was in a horrible place and to be honest I still am. But back then I didn't know I started coping with alcohol. That feeling was addictive.
When I was out on pretty much every weekend with my friends my goal was to get as quickly hammered as possible. I drank so much I regularly passed out and got my friends concerned. It was often considered to call ambulances, but they never did. There wasn't a party where I could leave it be.
Sometimes when I was sad at home, in the evening I would get what was there and just proceede to drink - I almost ruined an exciting trip by being hungover.

But it started to scare me. Passing out. Horrible hangovers I didn't have before. Memory loss of hours. Memory loss around people I didn't know. Waking up next to male friends in bed, worried sick that something had happened.
It didn't yet. But eventually it maybe would. The loss of control was very, very scary.
So I tried to quit. It wasn't easy, not at all. And sometimes I still got shitfaced. But over the time I got it - I was able to stop before I crossed the line.

I don't know if this was really alcoholism and I apologize if it's inappropriate for this sub.
But I had a real problem with it. And I appreciate everyone who reads this. Thank you.

alcoholism,TheSillyKoala,2019/01/10,"How long did it take before you were able to sleep and feel normal? I had my first night in a while where I actually remember going to bed. However, it took a long time for me to fall asleep and I woke up in the middle of the night a lot. I feel much better than I would after a night of drinking and being hungover all day, but waking up this morning was rough and I feel physically weak. How long did it take before you were able to sleep through a night and feel ""normal"" for lack of a better word?",4.853878205128204,4.485141759615384,5.693076923076927,85.11858974358975,68.90384615384616,8.471794871794872,25.025641025641022,7.793537801064563,1.0610179487179483,389,8,86,4,6,128,61,104,0.071,0.872,0.057,-0.3313,1,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,2,0,3,3,3,0,0,8,0,8,6,4,2,1,20,17,9,0,4,1,0,5,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,4,5,1,0,5,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,8,5,10,2,16,7,4,21,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,1,12,61,14,0,0.27378897160522137,0.0,0.1335892708763658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23297424932543756,0.0,0.0,0.2421440961600389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828561834443567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341044798115073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2768718609634823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11644237969112015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07780029101628695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36344193635119804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116382796436241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10063319834633402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5138648057558365,0.2682550612702469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15507476642921836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2739866987261569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2058552331891974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798242755477953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15209481072806527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724591501949803,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Embo22000,2019/01/10,Day one of many.... I don't drink because I'm depressed or lonely I drink because I like it but over the years it has lead to legal and relationships troubles.  I just got my license back after 8 years.  I realise i need help.  I could go a day or two without drinking but when I have a day off I end up drinking all day end up not even being able to do anything except cook because I love to cook but I do feel ashamed of being around people and having them notice I'm drunk.  I just need to quit all together.,0.8210195412064571,2.8635050186915905,2.7606457094307584,92.59546304163128,82.92523364485982,4.63857264231096,22.811384876805445,5.565023196281405,0.2124280373831775,395,14,85,2,11,132,66,107,0.14,0.741,0.119,-0.3182,0,2,4,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,1,2,6,6,0,1,3,0,9,8,0,1,2,20,17,8,0,3,10,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,7,0,1,7,0,2,3,4,0,2,1,1,14,2,14,13,2,18,0,2,0,1,4,5,0,2,12,59,16,2,0.14528180411616048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955454597564093,0.1293316071945249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11171273965474644,0.0,0.2656873179967739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159956988987605,0.0,0.0,0.3747789791645735,0.0,0.12513100500173607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5692834346934212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573531130457453,0.0,0.0,0.09595726143339657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07345884539091922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825669972997037,0.0,0.11619513049707506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09737933089006516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07097735102377438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13112250039517184,0.0,0.0,0.14729294649296035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21544923378615466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16540429690756292,0.0,0.0,0.09844671039175344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10072011028904752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15452508176828444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597828742335895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419192123497018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14004647477470886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18711343719951107
alcoholism,Rxevan87,2019/01/10,"My drinking has done it again I've always ran from my problems and emotions through drinking or substance abuse. I had to leave home to move across the country. I did good for a little while. No drinking, no drugs. Until one day I just started a spiral. A 40oz after work turned to 4. Then whiskey. Wine. Anything. Depression was at it's highest so I had no motivation to go out and meet people. No motivation to do anything other than drink away the pain. The pain of how I missed home. My mom. My friends. I started working up to 60 hours of overtime on top of my 80 hour work week. Anything to get me out of my head. I started going to the bar with coworkers every morning after work (3rd shift) from 8am to sometimes 6pm when I had work in 3 hours. I was broken, and I was continuously breaking myself. I downloaded tinder, genuinely in hopes to have company. I went to the bar down the road from my apartment to make friends. I had a good time that night, then got a DUI. Breathalyzer on my car, 9 days house arrest, fines on fines, AA. During my house arrest I matched with her. The most caring, loving, just all around the most amazing girl I've ever met. We share so many similar interests. We never had a dull moment. Eventually, after a fairly short time, we were in love. I was and still am, absolutely infatuated with this woman. She wasn't doing well in her life when we met, just as I wasn't. She got better, I got worse. She started telling me of things I did to her while I was drunk, and I still can't remember a fucking thing. We started having alcohol fueled arguments, that ultimately were purely miscommunication or lack of. I love her with every ounce of my being. I can't imagine doing anything other than loving her. Then it happened. Christmas night. My friends from home came to visit for a week that day. We all drank together, and my friends went to sleep. She later had her friends show up, and we played gamecube together. One thing led to the other, and we were yelling at each other over something so miniscule. Her friends left maybe an hour later, and the arguement struck back up. Until my dumb, dumb, drunk ass told her to just leave. After I realized what I said, I dropped down. Crying uncontrollably, having a panic attack (oh yeah I've got anxiety too). I begged her not to go. She insisted she needed to so we could heal. She came back the next day, and we talked about things. I said I was done drinking, and I'm going to go to the doctor to finally get help for my mental health. She spent the week with my friends and I then that Saturday, she left again. She said she needed her space so we could heal. I've never loved anyone like her. She's the only woman I've ever been able to actually visualize having a life with. We even picked out a name for a baby girl. Daisy. This passed Sunday I came home from work to all of her stuff gone. After I was sent a post she put on Instagram by someone that I've been nothing but an abusive alcoholic. She removed me from her followers so I couldn't see. Monday we spoke at a park near where I work. We laughed, we cried, we smiled. We stared into each others eyes as if we were the only ones on earth. It was so wonderful. I pleaded for her. She said we need time to ourselves to be better for each other in the future, yet she doesn't want to make any promises. I'm heartbroken. I'm lost. My apartment is torturous. I've been blindly driving around town just to stay out. I still haven't drank since the 26th. I'm medicated for my mental health now for the first time in my life, but the pills aren't fully saturated in my system to do much. I've been seeing a therapist since early December. I've cried every day. Panic attacks every day. I feel so alone, despite my mom and my few work friends being there for me as much as possible. She's everything I could have ever wanted or asked for. She took care of me at the lowest state I've ever been with my drinking. I'm forever grateful for that. But it drove her away. I have her birthday gifts (it was yesterday) in my car as I sit in this coffee shop she once brought me to, hoping that she'll respond and let me give them to her this evening. I know I need to focus on myself. I want to be better for myself, but I can't help but worry as to if we'll ever be able to be together again. The best love I've ever felt in my life. Gone in an instant. All cause I was too far up my own ass to do something when it really mattered. I can't imagine life without her. I can't help but have a tiny sliver of hope that we'll be together again one day. I feel like I'm rambling at this point. I don't want to drink anymore. I played pool with a friend at a bar Tuesday and didn't even think of getting a drink. I live 2 blocks away from one of the biggest liquor stores in the states, and I don't even look at it anymore. I have no desire to drink after my panic attacks, or when I cry over my lost love. I feel like I can finally say I'm done with drinking for good, but it's too late. I'm doing my best to get my head back on straight, but it's hard without her love. Idk why I'm posting this. Maybe it's cause of me feeling lost. Alone. I just hope that maybe someone reads this and stops while they're ahead. That drink isn't going to fix anything. It's just going to make everything worse, as I've proven to myself time and time again. It may be way too late, but I guess I can finally say lesson learned.

alcoholism,brooke-rose,2019/01/10,"What does it take for someone to be considered an alcoholic? My mother drinks more than she should at get togethers. She doesn’t think she has a problem and that I’m ruining her fun or that I’m ridiculous. She is very light and can’t have over two servings of wine before she starts getting in that drinking haze. 

She doesn’t drink in the morning but sometimes will start at 5ish if she’s home early enough and she will have more than a serving size in each glass she pours. 

I talk to a therapist and she says that my mom is an alcoholic and that I keep making excuses for her drinking and I didn’t want to think of her that way but I kinda have learned to accept it. 

Also my younger sister doesn’t see this side of her and when I mention some of it to her she acts like I’m overthinking it. (She doesn’t live with us she got married and moved out a few years ago) I don’t tell my sister directly that oh moms an alcoholic or anything I say that she’s had too much or she is having too much. 

There was only one time that my sister saw anything of it at a party at her place where my mom really had too much and wouldn’t let me take her drink away (I tried my best not to draw attention to me doing that) and she really needed to get out of there to not embarrass herself and my sister tried to take the drink away from her but my mom clutched onto it for dear life. I did eventually get her out and she had to vomit half the way home.

Since I live with my mom I’ve seen more of her drinking problems as my sister has not.

 I think my mom uses wine as a crutch.  She had a toxic relationship with my father and that’s where I was making excuses for her and was wondering why she doesn’t think to drink responsibly! I don’t drink hardly at all because of her. The only alcoholic drink I maybe will try is a cooler maybe twice a year but that’s it.

She did admit to me one time that she had a drinking problem. It was after a night with friends at our place where she was NOT making sense and it embarrassed me and I was mad the next day. That was the first tome she ever said something because before she always denied it. 

I said to my therapist but it comes and goes like there will be bad weeks, a good week, a bad weekend. Sometimes a month where I don’t see her overdrinking. But she says that’s how alcoholics are and that they still can be considered a alcoholic even if they don’t drink everyday or in morning hours.

You see I would know that she drank too much BUT I did not have it in my head that she is an alcoholic because I didn’t want to have that fact added onto my life as another issue. I had alcoholic and my mom drinks too much separated if that makes sense. 

Sometimes we go out with friends to a restaurant and she gets wine there with another bit you know they give you a small container of more wine to refill your glass) then she comes home and pours herself another large glass. 

Sorry this was so long this is my first time posting in this subject.  

I don’t tell my mom that she’s having too much anymore because my therapist gave me things to do. Like go downstairs when she starts drinking and don’t acknowledge it. Because when I mention it she says I’m crazy and as long as I talk to her about it she has a reason to put blame on me that I overthink everything hence “she doesn’t have a drinking problem” I do better now around her drinking and try not to let it upset me. I used to tell her when she stopped making sense “you aren’t making sense you’ve had too much to drink” but now I just notice it and go down to my room downstairs.

It would upset me because we don’t live with my father anymore so she shouldn’t have a reason to drink too much anymore...but she needs to help herself get better... does anyone think this is enough to be considered one?

alcoholism,Weekendthrowaway30,2019/01/10,"About to go 2-3 nights without alcohol for the first time in a year.. terrified Not sure if this is the right sub, I don't use reddit much. Not sure where else to turn. I know I have a problem and I'm not looking for an immediate solution, I just want to know what I'm in for.

Me and my friend are renting a place for the weekend to get away from our jobs and spend some time together.

I know this is bad of me, but he's a recovering alcoholic and doesn't know how much I drink. I drink about five shots of vodka a night (a shitty ""night cap"", I know) and have been doing so for about a year now. Prior to that, I drank maybe twice a year.

I've spent the night at his place a couple times and didn't drink and felt fine the next day. But I know I have a problem and I know I drink too much, and I'm worried that I'll start to experience withdrawal symptoms, which I've heard can be life threatening.

I'm trying to cut down but I know quitting drinking cold turkey is a terrible thing to do. Is it likely I'll experience that within a weekend? What do I do?

alcoholism,SmirnoffSuicide213,2019/01/11,"Welp I screwed up. Got on anxiety medications then went on a bender. Boyfriend is about to break up with me and I have to pick up the pieces Tomorrow I have my second AA meeting I plan on attending. Drank all week after a 40 hour sobriety stretch and I feel like garbage but feel the need to keep drinking so I don’t get sick. I stopped drinking 2 hours ago, been anxious ever since. My therapist just prescribed me anxiety meds. I wanna do anxiety meds right by not drinking so I can actually feel a positive effect. 

Long story short I’ve been sleeping like crazy after work and I’ve been avoiding my bf bcuz I don’t want him to see me like this. He does not support me going on meds but I’ve always lived with anxiety but it’s gotten worse the past 3 years. Probably because I drink. I just want to stop but I’m struggling. I made an attempted and I failed so hard. How do I stop? How do I make myself feel normal again. The thing that keeps repeating in my head..... in the documentary about Amy Winehouse. She says being sober is so boring. I related so much. How do I change? I’m so lost.

alcoholism,panda_98,2019/01/11,"Can't Help But Wonder (first post) TL;DR: First post happens to be a vent. Just looking for a listening ear as I talk about if I'm ignoring the red flags to a bigger problem.

This will almost definitely sound familiar to you guys (but on a case by case basis): 

My parents, extended family members, and grandparents were/are addicts - some drugs but mainly hardcore alcoholism. It destroyed the childhoods of my parents as well as mine and my siblings, not to mention that it killed my Biological mother since she was driving drunk (which has also made me scared of driving to a degree).

I didn't start drinking until I was around 16-17 years (I'm 20 now), and ever since then, I've only been allowed to drink around my stepmother, who happens to be very well aware of my family's history with addiction - hence that rule.

I also have a history of bad mental health that's never been treated, and one of my first impulses is to ask for a drink when I'm not doing good mentally. Then once I have that first drink, I'll drink until I can't anymore. It's an addictive cycle, but it's one I always wind up regreeting, not just because I feel awful the morning after, but I wind up getting scared that I'm following in my family's footsteps. My stepmom actually brought that up to me the morning after I found out that my paternal grandma died (I had gotten blackout drunk on wine and vodka to keep myself from crying). And that cycle also happens when I'm in a relatively good mental place. I just can't stop drinking once I start.

But then I feel like that I can't be an alcoholic since I don't drink too much and don't suffer the withdrawals that come with it. And a part of me can't help but feel scared that I'm just downplaying everything and ignoring the red flags to a bigger problem.",7.334444444444442,6.419075849002851,7.88280626780627,73.27839743589746,64.014245014245,10.876923076923077,35.45441595441596,10.125756701596842,3.5022945868945867,1417,56,262,27,18,472,173,351,0.177,0.777,0.046,-0.994,4,0,12,0,0,0,41.0,0,1,0,4,17,17,2,3,18,1,22,18,1,2,2,47,48,30,2,3,15,3,3,1,0,1,7,3,0,1,19,15,12,4,5,11,0,5,12,11,2,6,10,9,33,6,41,34,4,41,0,1,3,0,13,13,0,4,22,181,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.07272687592375522,0.2437338606280529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15929180689936362,0.0746272807139779,0.0,0.0,0.17879586149106866,0.062011815685531366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07391002076897106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13268833775952354,0.06967198963877545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06222631131764401,0.045430514310593965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06419777107626994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08186359341860856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07734648819774873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5110515133485686,0.08642679716389667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741326582557976,0.0,0.0,0.06697939397333838,0.0,0.2107701662357984,0.0,0.11304814383843301,0.05324157262359756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2535679832521973,0.0,0.08171419369418133,0.0,0.0,0.03893689312849717,0.0,0.0,0.12501817636467946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07379271105963668,0.19770996781892647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792179257869767,0.0,0.0,0.09990675773867884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0662423611625101,0.08245226097146732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03640976452010539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06258328564722605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07051854598760725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22531481374461945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054785373720003534,0.0,0.05747924350680525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587360620624108,0.10100184048689358,0.05668057644467901,0.0,0.0,0.16550517678733048,0.08070467339364969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786407606746229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14275110577234926,0.0,0.0,0.14262312519769346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2238413522751509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849466688386332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550013604672673,0.0,0.0,0.062307287602956486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059901382070351325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06149196673621302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13401610989808438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08082054623201287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04799246582687868

alcoholism,thespinkaay,2019/01/11,"It’s time for me to give up drinking before I lose my mind . I’ve been drinking heavily for about three years . I’ve spent thousands of dollars on going out and drinking alcohol , partying , Uber’s to and from parties and bars . I’ve been beat up while drunk, manipulative and manipulated and mentally drained and emotionally. I’ve hurt others I’ve hurt myself , I’ve killed my ambition and forced myself to do cocaine and abused it and hurt my body . 
I’ve gained so much weight and have lost a lot of the good healthy habits that I used to have . I’ve lost my desire to go back to school because of alcohol , I’ve lost my desires to be an artist , be a musician, learn and have an education and make something in my future happen for me .

alcoholism,plsthrowthisfaraway,2019/01/12,"How do I help my dad? My dad is a 56yo narcissist with a drinking problem. He’s been drinking for as long as I can remember. He’d usually start drinking with his friends in the evening and would only end when he’s drunk. He’s gone through ‘sober’ phases where he’d go months of staying at home at night with only 2 cans of beer max and ESPN. Despite his drinking behaviour he’s pretty functional I’d say since he’s quite established in his work. However things are getting worse where he would lie about his schedule and go  drinking and every night it worries my mom and I so much because he’d only come back at dawn. I’m convinced his behaviour has a lot to do with his social circle since he only drink when there’s company. 

The family dynamic had gone stale because of all the lying and hiding and on top of that I’m worried for his physical and mental health. However he’s too stubborn and old school to get help so I don’t think sending him for therapy is achievable in near future. 

I’m so hurt and I’ve considered to go no contact with him but I feel bad for my mom to have to handle this on her own. I’m leaving for college tomorrow so I really want to know how I can handle/manage this.

alcoholism,buddy5072,2019/01/12,"Aa and 161 straight meetings The first 20 meetings were a chore boring as hell why and whey an I here  the next 20 were the same but I still went. The next 20 I began to notice people in the meeting and I started to here what people were saying. After the red chip I started talking to the regulars and guess what no one bite me. Next set I’m talking in meetings and no laugh at me and I feel good about it. Oh all the time I gave out my phone number to new people but I was hoping no one would call me how can I help anyone. Now I’m in 100 straight days and I’m chatting away speaking up being involved and I love going to meetings, somewhere I started to love the meeting just happened, got sponsor book work not a ton so I’m moving on. Now I know a lot of nice people who care about my sobriety ( everyone cared from day one I just did not see it) so now I love meetings talk a lot and as I tell my sponsor and the group I get more out of the meeting than the book and sponsor it’s cool. I have more but I’m dyslexic as fuck and I have no idea how how this will read but it’s still getting better as of this morning ",-0.08443687018375813,2.0364832697095423,1.8190678719620657,97.35103215767636,87.67219917012449,3.9407824540604626,20.640337877889745,4.999035159303659,-0.32086496739774706,872,29,198,3,28,287,122,241,0.076,0.71,0.214,0.991,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,3,16,14,2,0,17,1,11,4,0,3,1,35,38,25,0,2,8,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,9,14,0,0,3,4,0,3,6,3,1,4,9,6,24,11,27,26,7,33,1,0,2,4,25,11,2,4,18,135,33,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124555512374669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10916809953396346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276416157205198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11864707794193716,0.0,0.2369350791578083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14987105102971096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11102835824456833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058751183914888976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09883456759981306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074194921494185,0.1214131515084108,0.0,0.06603573494574268,0.09745802482351204,0.0929309662508263,0.0,0.12800080450048434,0.0,0.10274998143921353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778823972550252,0.0,0.0,0.11540687192262172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311688968292214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0638571904856302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19756798843076429,0.3146088981565646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12349584663223034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11222090123812148,0.37072095117712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322876532596632,0.0,0.0,0.2362082098049163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322217192063366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11622545616182495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240214235610182,0.0,0.0,0.09259158420277433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467281600973021,0.0,0.18558537681211654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2801770374771351,0.10155868830639816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677536630448675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10771301360381667,0.10484702337921847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08459062489986315,0.0,0.0,0.08254089264832504,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,theboyinthewindow,2019/01/12,"The Secret Confessions of an Alcoholic on the Edge So I have been wanting to write about confessing my feelings for a long time. I don't know if this will help me in anyway, do me harm or nothing at all but I wanted to get it out there. Maybe it will help someone out there who knows. There is so much spilling out of me this may seem all over the place. 

&amp;#x200B;

For over 8 years I have been an alchoholic. It took me a long time to admit it. I love alcohol and hate it at the same time. I have been to rehab, and given it up more times then I can count only to have it re-enter my life. I'm drawn to it but also go out of my way to avoid it. I lock myself away from the world because of my fear and what I become when I drink. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean it is around every corner out there, and every corner in my mind. There is nowhere to hide. My family keeps a close eye on me because of my past so its like a prision but I feel like I deserve it too for my past mis deeds. Torn between,  I have existed in a weird paradoxical purgtory. When I don't drink, I feel like I'm not really here, I don't enjoy much and life seems pointless. I think about drink from time to time, more frequently lately but i mostly feel like im floating through life. When I do drink, I feel happy for about 10 minutes before I drink too much and forget what happens. All that is left when I come to is pain, shame and the hurt that I have caused those I care about.  

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't drank in two months now, I go month periods without drinking, But I feel misrable. At first I feel great and after the illness wears away from the excess I'm at my peak. But over time i whittle away back to where I am now.  I'm reaching my usual cycle where I reset with drinking. I don't want to and try to stay strong but its hard and everyday gets more bleak. 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss interaction, I used to have friends. I used to have a girlfriend. Since I locked myself up I haven't seen any of them. I'm scared to go out there. They want to go to pubs and bars. Places which are danger zones for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss sex.  God... that one is an itch I wish I didn't have. I get anrgy at being horny and get horny every few days. I wish I never had experienced how great sex can feel.  I think how long its been since i had sex. I can't even remember.  Maybe two years now, who knows. Your guess is now as good as mine. How sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

When was the last time I went on a date? I laugh in my head but it ain't funny. I think about seeing a prostitue. I have done so in the past and it was nice to just feel something. Even a good cuddle with a woman would be more than enough right now. But who am I kidding. I miss sex bad. I hate porn and masturbation. I want to feel close to someone. I just want to feel.  I used to think drink made me horny and wanting sex but when the drink left the feeling is still there, I hate it. Why can't we have a damn off switch for sexual desire. I would shut that thing down in a heartbeat.

&amp;#x200B;

I could try go out, clear out my system. Do all the things I know is wrong but people will ask ""where are you going? what are you doing"". I can't tell them the truth. They want to keep me locked up anyway or follow me everywhere. ""Can I go with you?"" F No!

I know it is with good intentions but it drives me crazy.  I want to cry but I'm trapped and there is no escape for me. Do i want to escape? Or is it better I'm trapped here, safe but misrable. What a miserable state of affiars with no light at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I guess if you made it this far, learn from me. If you have any of the things I don't, appreciate them. If you have a girlfriend, a lover, a friend.. love them like no one else could. Alchohol has taken one of the most important things I ever had in my life, my freedom... and in turn happiness.

alcoholism,bloodyrainbows_,2019/01/12,"Been trying to cut back drinking the past few weeks, but I’m used to drinking daily anywhere from 5 to 10 drinks, depending on the night. I’ve become somewhat of a raging alcoholic over the past 6ish months and I’m now trying to finally kick the habit. I never thought it would be this hard. I am really used to going to the bar late at night with all the other regulars, and I am having so much trouble focusing on more important things because all I ever want to do is get wasted! Now that I’ve decided to take a step back from drinking, people don’t seem to be as interested in me or want to talk to me. It makes me feel like shit, and I’m wondering if I’m really that awful as a sober person or if they feel like they can’t relate to me as well because I don’t  want to drink anymore. It hurts, especially when you thought you had a close, trustful friend but once the drinks are gone, so are they. I’m not sure how to cope with the loneliness... I have never felt so alone in my life.",4.8501294498381835,4.567920825242723,5.998203883495147,82.63413430420714,68.90291262135922,9.390938511326864,28.331715210355988,9.075114841892004,2.013567637540454,774,23,167,13,12,260,119,206,0.155,0.722,0.123,-0.8817,0,1,7,0,0,0,19.0,0,2,3,0,11,12,3,0,12,1,16,10,1,5,6,37,38,17,0,6,7,0,4,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,8,6,8,0,8,7,0,3,6,5,1,0,6,4,16,7,28,29,6,26,0,1,0,0,8,7,1,8,18,109,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11397946187916615,0.0,0.11046018820204344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10577096912520452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16401891734659105,0.0,0.1300291753809202,0.11778969398259333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6268751413916951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09647360918155873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10785377144796636,0.15238563527808005,0.1024034617884695,0.11683298446770822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08239972765848562,0.0,0.05572171240215167,0.0,0.060613272700634685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09554000520746378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11417408220446365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12030906072716645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753320623400231,0.10421039092790522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07119160581778973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851292876651233,0.0,0.07840211668136914,0.0,0.1645145063428467,0.0,0.0,0.20017295048431616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11358180490803252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20362442746484305,0.07393965762407527,0.09312515518077433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13664909394254884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09709274940709886,0.0,0.0,0.10947761829731488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10051904932136224,0.0,0.08018967039299041,0.08572352121676201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085541474000387,0.0,0.0,0.16934089996395096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448205690950303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842276388015615,0.0,0.0,0.1887198433454841,0.0,0.08555048339352077,0.0,0.09589372100583457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566046675740105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07576312490740722,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Invisiblemonk,2019/01/12,"Pressing Question Hello all hope your evening is going well.  So I've heard a lot about people using alcohol to deal with anxiety, but my story is a little different and was wondering if anyone can relate.

I am 22 years old and started drinking around 17.  Before I started drinking I had ZERO problems with anxiety.  I never really had it unless there was a reason like a presentation or something like that.  After 5 years of drinking pretty much every weekend in excess, I have developed anxiety pretty bad.  Since I did not use alcohol to cope with it when I first started, I'm wondering how this sickness became a part of my life due to alcohol consumption.  

Will it go away for good if I stop hard cold?  Or will I have to now deal with this phenomenon for the rest of my life because of my dumb decisions as a reckless teen?  

Thanks all and much love:)",4.924059304703481,6.442212975460127,6.2130214723926365,74.71172034764828,69.5521472392638,9.114314928425358,31.37474437627812,9.516144504307137,3.1772989775051137,677,29,115,15,12,228,107,163,0.145,0.708,0.147,0.3632,1,0,7,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,0,1,9,10,1,0,7,0,13,10,0,4,3,30,27,13,0,4,7,0,2,2,0,2,6,1,0,0,6,8,6,1,5,4,0,2,2,3,1,2,6,4,14,7,21,19,7,21,0,0,0,1,7,4,1,9,17,87,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3692098969515117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2642889953338329,0.0,0.0,0.08052186133190158,0.0,0.0,0.102515939069006,0.0,0.0,0.10819568601817264,0.0,0.09615296788312852,0.07019986708069495,0.0,0.09799184046674804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2374477770658466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031666102054984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3384359815631511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0760614437547267,0.0,0.09702643746351602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09795419989375533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13089504488343726,0.09658991865545352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10315985849798744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11437888661783235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626804368386458,0.11252175629254436,0.11541958705303712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979040769911297,0.1039355077438194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693102537566304,0.0,0.08881773220726437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12084001510656453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12470599179864393,0.0,0.07983676158825832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23431623868500745,0.0,0.11019162542450747,0.0,0.0,0.1290044529211588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07377381424870526,0.11840264780831848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952607277766887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08865503641768002,0.0,0.0,0.244530432018962,0.0,0.0,0.09627809357346877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10602294952059203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989208301686666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10354178512264273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2497700802631432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14831726090039193
alcoholism,messy_lady,2019/01/13,"Looking for help in Montreal I feel myself spiralling. I’m a 21 year old Anglo student in Montreal. I moved here to escape my abusive family but I never spent time processing things properly. I don’t have many friends here, I’m very lonely. I drink heavily to sleep and not dream of terrible things. But it’s getting out of hand, it’s not just two tall cans anymore it’s tons of alcohol. The only person I don’t force myself to drink heavily with is the person I’m dating, but it’s not his burden and I don’t see him that frequently. I know long term i need a therapist but taking those steps feels so heavy right now. Kind of wondering if there was someone or something to start off with in mtl for me (Total anglophone and very socially anxious) I don’t know what this post even is I need help ",2.8381987577639727,4.7440640931677045,4.359596273291928,84.28920807453419,75.77018633540372,8.078260869565218,25.785714285714285,8.841846274778883,2.0444459627329192,633,23,125,14,14,211,103,161,0.053,0.809,0.138,0.9223,0,2,4,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,0,4,0,9,5,2,0,2,25,25,10,0,3,10,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,10,6,3,0,5,3,1,2,8,3,0,1,2,5,17,2,17,23,3,20,0,1,2,0,8,7,0,3,10,80,27,1,0.0,0.1816573976312217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16385089081972234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17320630844383308,0.15205079255772408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3003875980705472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126544888813943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14453507336915228,0.0,0.15504491983609028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11845352274481324,0.0,0.08010260852759621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20553236946749856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15965766485567975,0.16851971858380535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13568208217465408,0.12874895832152305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554409340351926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16295334293962915,0.0,0.22736750763884706,0.11824870890169314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16088201550414774,0.0,0.0,0.11660565754651038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677436685965583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14683677900067366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309331944070022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12217502519619547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534292636034794,0.15628894243587174,0.12990630037791992,0.11803210162537588,0.0,0.0,0.10851965088059487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11527646044127401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17801464055863936,0.2037160490695844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08940127292252546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497699343412267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530077026334615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662674151849899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09873211223396032
alcoholism,throwaway712347,2019/01/13,"How should I bring up my gf's drinking problem? [M24] [F24] TLDR; My gf isn't an alcoholic, but whenever she does drink, she drinks until she is stumbling drunk and can't control her emotions. How do I bring this up?

She doesn't get drunk too regulary, maybe twice a month. However whenever she does drink, she always gets far too drunk. Last night she got thrown out of a bar for drinking too much. She then cried for hours, kept getting annoying and angry, she really can't control her emotions when drunk. I even had to carry her up the stairs as she couldn't walk without falling. 

I don't have a drinking problem, I don't like getting drunk but on the odd occasion that I do get drunk, I'm able to control my emotions. I've considering giving up alcohol completely, maybe lead by example and hope she follows?

alcoholism,throwaway011319,2019/01/13,"Alcoholic or not? How to approach. Trying to figure out if my friend is actually an alcoholic. Friend drinks about 5 nights a week, not often in large quantities, but still most nights of the week. Claims to be a beer/liquor snob, but will drink anything that is around when alcohol is available. I even once saw him take a drink when the bartender had no idea what he was asking for and just whipped something together. He complained about how awful it was to me, but still drank it.  I am concerned that he makes every social function involve alcohol. I know that he is not with friends 5 nights a week, so drinking that much means solo drinking occurs. I know my friend goes to bars alone and also has planned for guests to come drink, when the guests don't show, he still drinks as planned. Alone.

My friend does well in all other aspects of life and has no known personal or professional problems due to alcohol.

What makes things more concerning is that my friend is now dating someone that works in the mental health industry who cannot drink at all. When I questioned this, he half-jokingly expressed excitement in having a dd. I feel like he is a budding alcoholic, at the very least, and worried about how this relationship will work as all of social gatherings with friends involve alcohol.

I have not directly addressed the problems that I see. I feel that it is going to ruin him eventually and certainly crumble this budding relationship. I also wanted to see first if others outside of those who know me think that his drinking is an issue or not. Is drinking, even just a beer or two, 5 nights a week alcoholism? I have seen him drink upwards of 8 drinks over 6 hours and only have a buzz.",6.186429317808628,7.24541880877743,5.833345275414243,80.2962904911181,66.24137931034483,8.960203015375429,32.431855500821015,9.107695989026183,2.7642520077623525,1356,55,247,23,21,419,164,319,0.135,0.777,0.08800000000000001,-0.942,0,2,23,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,5,24,16,1,0,17,1,25,25,0,5,4,52,44,27,0,5,16,0,2,1,11,2,10,0,1,1,23,11,23,0,11,15,0,3,9,5,1,2,6,6,21,11,32,35,7,32,0,1,4,0,36,9,0,9,21,169,44,3,0.0,0.0,0.05391378283047607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4723438907426662,0.0,0.11443990480239592,0.0,0.08836312688148641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04546414733562488,0.04918216364472728,0.05164913893304169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0475909991188842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04834763207304582,0.0,0.0,0.6494605221261693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07298116581229616,0.0,0.046548567652327816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055869791360976084,0.03946896587433457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04699366296220685,0.0,0.0,0.2987896363263755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03139853946715426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05872571855880845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05440785287973432,0.0,0.0,0.062367925295891836,0.0,0.05766424200963426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108806848467936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03902308235701935,0.02699123415260784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0737565336899076,0.0,0.0,0.06018093860059118,0.0,0.0,0.0556766843179668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04061341427787028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20738488472913968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058836994362096724,0.0,0.042018363229960574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04824015813780321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10572916959300632,0.0,0.0,0.06189006482393108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11863070170529365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805052335090507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126361394510808,0.046811194499397225,0.042532376415033435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13236264690208338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04153939258696448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036704115073336055,0.035400493521736284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037509559802554895,0.0,0.053968972299366286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045585136145689466,0.032586523190413955,0.0,0.17726548061724834,0.0,0.04967431470867351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08044196302659093,0.0561067182305852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,buns_crystal,2019/01/13,"My boyfriend said he doesn't trust me. So I have been sober for not even a month, and my boyfriend and his buddy are going to be drinking tonight. He asked if I was going to have a problem with that i told him no. My problem is being alone with alcohol I dont trust myself if I am alone. He told me he doesnt trust me either. I feel like i just go jabbed in the heart because he said something true to me. But the truth hurts. I hurt him emotionally when I ended up in the hospital twice last month in the same week for extreme alcohol intoxication. I know that broke my trust with him but it still hurts and I dont know how to deal with that feeling.

alcoholism,TracerHere404,2019/01/13,"Relapse. I had a relapse last night. It wasn't too bad but I do feel some guilt. My family came over and was concerned because I have some liver damage and if I keep drinking to much it can become life threatening. The doctors told me if I keep drinking I will destroy my liver and die. I don't know why I thought it was a good idea. Ill only have a few I told myself. But it always seems that alittle turns into more and more. Before I knew it I was staggering around outside, empty beer cans were everywhere. But I'm back on the path of sobriety. I hope I can be strong enough not to have another relapse. Rome wasn't built in a day! Keep at it everyone and I will too!

alcoholism,Witchetta,2019/01/13,"A young new comer After a particularly bad experience 2 days ago, and the 2nd black out in a month I’ve decided to accept I have problematic drinking. I haven’t had a drink since. I’m 22 and I can see this will be an issue for me as long as I drink. I don’t know what my social life will be like without but I have to try.

I don’t remember the last time I went over a week without a drink in maybe 4 years. I’m going to go to my first AA meeting this week but I am wary the god stuff may not make it work for me. Does anyone have any recommendations on other ways to start this journey?

I’m scared, disappointed in myself and so I would really appreciate any words of wisdom.

alcoholism,abp105,2019/01/14,"Need advice for my father. Hello, I am looking for advice for my father. He has been drinking since the 80’s he’s 62 YOA now. He started of drinking casually to weekly to daily. From the past 5 years he has been drinking daily and needs it as early as the afternoon. Last week he was hospitalized due to his sodium levels being down, spent 3 days in the hospital. My family and I talked to him and our family doctors advised him that due to his drinking habits it’s affecting his liver. He promised us that this he won’t drink again (the 9838729th...promise he made). I have taken him to AA meetings in which he went once but never returned. My family and I requested him to go to inpatient rehab but he says he will stop on his own but continues after a few days. 

I would like to ask if anyone can please recommend a option we have? We live in New Jersey, my father is covered under my mothers insurance.

alcoholism,trashley42069,2019/01/14,"I think I’m becoming an alcoholic Ok here we go 

I’ve worked in the service industry for several years. I now work in production at a brewery. I’ve always been sensitive and aware of my drinking habits. Never too bad, mostly on the weekends etc etc. some of my boyfriends have done terrible things to me while drunk, so I’m pretty aware. I’m recently going through relationship issues/breakup/anxiety problems and I had to WORK HARD to not start drinking until 4pm. I’m justifying 4-5pm a reasonable hour to start drinking. It’s also my day off. And on days I do work, I have one beer at work before I go home. 

The difference is that it was difficult for me to get through my day without just wanting to pour 4oz of whiskey into a cup. When I go to my local bar, it’s a shot and a beer. I sip it, and At about 2 beers and 3 bullet bourbons later, I’m done. 


 I CRAVED it today. When I woke up.

This is easily the first time I have craved alcohol.  I sleep at night with Advil pms. Yes, I’m working on insurance paperwork to see a better therapist. But I just want the warm feeling of even a little whiskey to get me through my day.  It’s astonishing how much better I feel after some whiskey. At dinner, I had 3 cocktails. Not bad. But I left my group to go have more at the bar. I can’t stand going home and being alone. 

I’m scared.

alcoholism,childlikeempress16,2019/01/14,"How to handle? My husband drinks often and can never have just one (or five). Recently he had an emotional breakdown about how he thinks he is an alcoholic so we started paying for expensive counseling. He and the counselor agreed he wouldn’t drink while under his care. He was scheduled to go on a vacation and I asked if it was too tempting and if he should cancel and he said no. I asked him multiple times to tell his family that he was going on vacation with about this new situation so they could be aware before hand, supportive and help him be accountable.  He kept putting it off and giving excuses and of course, has been drinking the whole time he is on vacation. His siblings are posting multiple pictures of it on social media. 

My initial reaction was to blow up. I immediately cleaned out our liquor cabinet at home and all the alcohol. Now that I feel a little more calm, what’s the best way to handle this?  I haven’t spoken to him yet and don’t want to be reactionary.  I want him to feel I’m supportive but I still need to hold him accountable. 

The way I feel, right or wrong, is deceived and mislead.  He originally told me he hides his drinking from me and I am not comfortable in a marriage where things are hidden, that’s a very slippery slope in my opinion.

alcoholism,FireTheLaserBeam,2019/01/14,"I realized I’m boring. So I quit drinking back in May. Was an alcoholic for 12 years. Well, I quit smoking before I quit drinking. Switched to vaping. Then I cut out caffeine because it was hell on my nerves if I wasn’t drunk. And now, I finally quit drinking. 

Okay, I’ll get the two references outta the way: the guy from the Friends episode who was boring when he got sober; and Adam Ant. Okay.

So, really, I don’t go out much. Not to bars. I’m 40 but I’m still a server and I don’t hang out with the rest of the staff. They’re all in their early 20s. They invite me out but they all respect my new sobriety.

Anyway, I don’t have the, I don’t know, “patience” for things like I used to. I can’t watch a movie all the way through. I only play my games a few hours a week instead of per day. I’m not depressed or anything. It’s just, for twelve years everything revolved around booze.

I like to write, and I was prolific, but that was when I was drinking. Now that I’m sober I just can’t put anything to paper. It doesn’t help that the stuff I wrote while drunk was complete shit anyway.

I don’t know, man. I don’t even try to date because I have absolutely nothing new or exciting going on in my life. I’ve volunteered to help with seniors to occupy some of my time, but I haven’t started that yet.",0.12697992700730154,2.3103540109489056,2.047185218978104,95.63603330291971,87.35766423357664,5.322810218978104,20.606295620437955,6.770275591412753,0.29190547445255444,1005,33,230,13,32,332,143,274,0.084,0.79,0.126,0.8959,0,0,5,0,0,0,40.0,0,0,3,4,17,15,3,0,14,2,21,11,1,1,3,34,35,17,0,1,11,0,0,2,1,1,2,0,0,2,10,11,9,0,4,9,0,4,13,6,1,1,10,1,32,9,28,24,7,38,1,1,1,0,13,10,2,5,24,144,42,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12416649222814173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19122080526311894,0.1034293337484186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08933913746484476,0.0,0.14165066520039285,0.0,0.09886492641339216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12181782217045703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07492975027288087,0.0,0.10007001969080524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4552684965539079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07673913464518661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104419637935181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727505130072844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08976428713758021,0.0,0.060701897129987824,0.0,0.13206129121199622,0.0,0.09292380410959428,0.0,0.0,0.11504147341449347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15575278979835672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11441887784121912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12770453809034807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206494204182667,0.1135243006232029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854093856128872,0.0,0.0,0.22442450486326687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11148269610342308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836397165173904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11679807321497003,0.0,0.4943084401843005,0.0,0.0,0.07443112285872913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11926229179674434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223638162877868,0.0,0.09278553692182784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13300409369131538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718818950876774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06774844130529789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07888202738698827,0.0,0.11349591873046327,0.0,0.0,0.10034658571082533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1844445811893565,0.09319664487148284,0.0,0.10446431986686666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14963873537745134
alcoholism,interventioneer,2019/01/14,"Had an intervention for a friend today, need advice Throwaway account since my buddy follows me on Reddit. Long story short, we got our buddy to commit to rehab. We offered “let’s go now” option but got the “let’s go tomorrow” line. 

How can I and friends best support our buddy through these difficult times?  I’m worried tomorrow is going to be another excuse compounded by more lies and excuses. 

Thanks in advance for help. It’s been an emotional day but getting the commitment is the first step toward recovery.

alcoholism,bayareadream20,2019/01/14,"Need to stop I hardly ever post here but felt the need to today. My boyfriend wants me to go to rehab. This weekend I made a complete ass of myself and fell asleep at the table at his union crab feed. They to  drag me out. I’m mortified and sad for him. I usually binge drink at home 2-3 a weeks, never in public. I called rehab yesterday, they should be calling me today. I live by myself and have bills, so I need to do out patient, however they told me I need a 7 day detox first. That’ll be tough too, as I have pets and bills to pay. So I inquired to my doctor about Naltrexone. Hes approved me for it. Long story short I started drinking when my daughter died 2 years ago. I’ve come to terms with it now years later but for 2 years I binged drank every night. I kept my job, still had a normal life, but secretly drank at night. I’ve calmed down a bit as my current bf hates it but when I do it’s to black out. I understand his concern, I’m honestly still glad he’s stuck by me. 
It’s just that some days that wicked devils talk me into going to the liquor store, I want to stop. Any one have any success on Naltrexone?",1.156737967914438,2.908399815126053,2.8585026737967922,93.83689839572195,80.26050420168067,5.839877769289534,20.06187929717341,6.7829847944221076,0.14401008403361315,868,22,198,9,22,287,141,238,0.161,0.753,0.087,-0.9538,3,0,2,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,3,3,12,8,1,0,8,0,11,13,2,1,2,34,32,14,1,8,5,1,2,0,1,2,5,0,2,0,9,10,6,3,4,4,4,4,1,4,0,2,8,3,36,4,33,20,3,46,1,1,1,1,16,12,1,1,29,118,45,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117048909373848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17138934434743086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13757598471567162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573512619196934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10855095556167776,0.1321245626771546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16253878636017402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13078390514883725,0.0,0.0,0.12898191939043105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24689388603459506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11398798276354832,0.10617325948684678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209943749000222,0.0,0.0,0.1071884834177984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432347093149474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11288488695724508,0.12441394266600453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12640354227141612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12505066332001818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08900827797783402,0.0,0.0,0.11127374968985236,0.11151950596009033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11923864993195105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737547613784757,0.09719070776169693,0.0,0.0,0.23651349859414664,0.12346816194833875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08539117569451819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12068774880567855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08919422269469073,0.0,0.2012718380633564,0.21070873628063613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012862620335633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2388953916754297,0.1204129448392083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13118629021793435,0.0,0.0,0.13878796368410098,0.0,0.14865408569867994,0.0,0.10108180992919616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2434490140979925
alcoholism,jayjay-bay,2019/01/14,"I am sober and currently undergoing treatment for addiction-based mental disorders - but I’ve slipped 2 times in the last 6 months. I don’t know if I should quit the rehab or not. Okay so I went into a month long rehab and got sober on may 22nd last year. It’s a been a pretty tough time since then because I’ve had to deal with a lot of anxiety and depression that I was stuffing away when drinking. Then in september last year, when I was about 4 months sober, I had a pretty bad slip. Got wasted for an entire weekend and pretty much never spoke of it to anyone. Then it happened again in late november. I drank a 6-pack in 1 night, then no more - never told anyone. I am now on my 2nd week of rehab that takes on depression, anxiety and other mental disorders in addicts. I think I want to tell the psychs all of this but I don’t want to risk dropping out of the treatment and possibly having to go into a rehab facility again. What should I do?

alcoholism,winowrites,2019/01/14,"Wife needing perspective My husband is an alcoholic. He won't say that, but it's true from my perspective. He has ruined us financially because he won't go to work, he has completely checked out of our 15 year marriage and 3 kids for a long period of time, and he is psychologically abusive (in my opinion). 

In October I had finally had enough after he told me on a Wednesday he would stop drinking and got black out drunk and pooped his pants the following Saturday. We have 3 kids. I can't live this way any longer. I told him he either had to leave or stop drinking. He chose to leave. 

He came back after a week with promises of going to AA and therapy and church, and no alcohol. I believed him. I even made him sign a contract promising to uphold it, because in the past, all the times we've had the same conversation, it didn't work. 

In the next two weeks he stayed sober. Traded his truck in, got himself a new used car, made a lot of big decisions financially (took out a large loan, when he only needed a couple of hundred dollars), and then suddenly one morning decided I was ""too quiet"", not affectionate enough, a nag, etc. etc. and he took his belongings and left again. Again!

He was only gone a day, but in that day he went to his mothers and got drunk. I asked if he was serious about his sobriety, then why would his first instinct be to drink? I try to be understanding. I know everyone has issues, we all have trauma. I know things aren't an easy straight line. But why? 

He said it's because he doesn't have a drinking problem, he's only sober to please me. 

Another month goes by. He was ok for most of it, but he never did any of the things he promised other than staying sober, but then he started getting mad at little stuff again. On a Sunday morning, he woke up, left for 4 hours, came home with his bumper popped off, and in a GREAT mood. I thought, either he's cheating or was drinking. Because he's lied about being drunk a million times. (Which he now says never happened.) He told me he didn't tell me where he was going because I was ""short"" with him, and I deserved it. He took his stuff and left again, under the guise on my unreasonable behavior. 

He went to his mothers and drank again. 

His Mom knows this problem and says she's never ""seen"" it as a problem there for she believes her loved ones when they say it's ok. Even though her brother OD'd and died from drugs that she claimed weren't a problem. 

He came home again the next day. Establishing again, that I deserved it, because I shouldn't have been mistrustful. 

Today, it's been 2 weeks. And he's gone again. Because this time I asked him to take out left overs to the trash. 

I keep begging him to help with the kids or the house, because he barely works now, and he still refuses. So this morning he started the day with, ""You're being unreasonable. We can't communicate. To build better communication skills, I think I should live at my mothers for a while.""

So I'm telling him I need him and his response is to leave. To build better communication, his solution is to do it less. And to build trust in the perspective of alcoholism, he needs to go live where he's had some of his worst moments? 

I think he's finding some way to turn me into a bad person so he can justify (to himself) that he should leave and in turn, drink. All the times he leaves, the first thing he does is drink. 

He blames me for everything in his life, down to once he tripped at work, and he told me it was my fault he tripped because I took up to much of his time thinking. If it weren't for ME he wouldn't have tripped. 

I feel like he is turning that same perspective into finding faults so he can find excuses to leave, and then drink. He is completely all over the place. Him saying he couldn't live with me and needed to leave, an hour later after me literally sobbing and saying ""If you'll just tell me how to talk to you I will"" because he says I'm \*too loud, then I try and talk calmly and I'm \*condescending, which then I try and \*email which he ignores, and then I \*text and he won't respond. So I'm out of ideas. I'm out of hope. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is never going to stop, is it? And am I at all justified in thinking all his issues with leaving me FOUR times in 2 months stems from him finding ways to fault me so he can go drink? Because he says that's insane. Even though that's exactly what he does. 

I never knew he had so much anger or hostility toward me, nor thought I was such a bad wife, until I gave him the ultimatum in October. And he has made my life hell ever since. And I feel so incredibly stupid because I keep thinking it'll stop or get better, and it just keeps repeating that same sick cycle.

alcoholism,Reezus262,2019/01/14,"Working at a Liquor Store has Made me Hate Alcohol Hey all, title says it pretty bluntly but it honestly just makes me so depressed sometimes. For some context im 20 started drinking a little at 18 like every couple of months just in a social setting. I got this job almost a year ago, its part time and really not anything special but the pays pretty nice and it has a ton of oppurtunity to move up to higher positions with pretty good benefits and such due to all hard liqour stores being run through the state where I live. To a guy who was not really sure what I wanted to do in life and having no current motivation for college it really appealed to me. 

The job itself is fine, typical clerk and stocking type stuff, managers have all been very nice etc. The depressing part is seeing the effect alcohol has on people. Seeing the same people every day sometimes 2 or more times a day coming in to buy a pint of some cheap vodka or a 5th of some cheaper vodka just so theyre not sick. At times I feel somewhat guilty because im the one selling it to them (I know if it wasnt me someone else would be) now when I drink in a social setting it just kinda sucks. I think of how terrible this shit is for people that are addicted to it and I know occasinal social drinking probably wont lead to addiction but it still just kinda ruins the whole thing for me.

Idk it wasnt even that bad until the other day. A girl probably in her mid 20s or 30s young comes in just about everyday for a pint of vodka. Through interactions with her and my manager who knows a little more about her than I, I know that shes had 2 duis within 6 months and on probation where shes not allowed to drink. She still drink almost everyday id say with her coming in the other day literally holding back tears. My manager asked what was wrong and she just brought up about how her family hates her because of her drinking, she wants to quit so bad and just cant etc. It was really heartbreaking to listen to. This was literally as she was checking out buying a pint (legally we cant refuse a sale unless someones underage, already visibly drunk or attemped to steal or something like that) my manager went outside with her to console her and shit. 

I never personally have dealt with a loved one being an alcoholic so these type of things are the closest I have to experience with the subject.

Its just so sadening to watch everyday, I havent even gotten into the customers who've went to rehab for an extended period then their 1st day out come to the liquor store.

alcoholism,unbalanced47,2019/01/15,"Possibly in need of help? Just landed my dream job with my dream company with awesome benefits/pay. I already know I’ve starting my road into alcoholism and I want to ensure I don’t fall into a vicious cycle. 

For reference, I am 21 years old. Started “drinking” (not often at all) at around 14. At 16-17 I was drinking regularly-ish (1-2 days a week). For about 8 months this past year I would absolutely demolish a case of beer between Friday and Sunday, then continue to drink when I could and as much as I could the rest of the week, (at the expense of my fathers liquor cabinet) until Friday rolled around again.

I have slowed down quite a bit since being laid off from my last job, and I would like some opinions on how to deal with this issue. I feel I can slow down but the temptations are extremely real.

alcoholism,greysneakthief,2019/01/16,"Physical things I realize how hard alcohol and binge drinking has been on my cognition and body. The past two weeks have been alcohol free because I’m tired of wasting away under the influence.

I’ve been experiencing confusion and lack of focus, memory problems, physical tenseness, insomnia, and aphasia. The thing is, I know a little alcohol will help alleviate the symptoms, but I realize many of the problems are caused largely by my chronic drinking in the first place.

I was expecting physical reactions, but I wasn’t expecting it to extend this long. Is it normal to extend beyond the first few weeks? Is there anything I should be doing to help heal more effectively?",8.680588235294117,9.436907647058824,8.987899159663865,60.902689075630256,60.764705882352935,13.18655462184874,42.21008403361344,12.540900571622839,6.128324369747901,546,30,80,19,7,181,79,119,0.122,0.753,0.125,0.5223,0,0,5,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,3,3,4,0,1,8,0,15,11,1,4,0,21,17,7,0,7,2,0,1,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,5,4,5,0,4,2,1,0,1,3,0,3,5,2,8,2,12,9,3,13,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,1,6,62,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4990694696721769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12809744958890246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14625058560929696,0.0,0.0,0.0948907673502068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17290658758985833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15990886016059702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3049811091762913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2648138687330965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13944354226996458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2086753594837413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554835655980551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15601529800785865,0.0,0.13775692532837638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578179284962296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15251676573994224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485980213039227,0.0,0.0,0.1626347849936936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2978970851918759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16179354005267674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20683126401131335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17891180884621424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520602081778364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24972706294908936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,TrexTacoma,2019/01/16,Need advice on drinking problem I'm a 22 year old male who's been drinking daily since I was 18. I started out with a few shots a night but quickly transitioned to about half a fifth a day. When I was 20 I switched to beer (bud light platinum) and would drink anywhere from 6 to 12 a day. Back in June of this year (6.11.18) I injured two discs in my back and subsequently switched back to liqour. Since then I have been drinking anywhere from a third to half a handle of New Amsterdam Gin daily. I am starting to feel it in the general area my liver is located as well as where my esophagus is. I recently got to a point to where I truly want to stop and I know the problems I have. The problem is I dont have health insurance and truly dont feel that I can do it alone. Advice anyone?,2.1622874671340924,3.8426711226993855,3.6464198071866782,89.65676380368099,77.03680981595092,6.620333041191938,26.366783523225237,7.447530270364453,1.2629127081507447,615,24,133,8,14,203,96,163,0.114,0.81,0.076,-0.7184,0,1,5,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,0,9,4,0,0,12,0,16,8,1,0,0,18,25,9,0,6,1,0,2,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,5,6,5,1,3,5,0,0,2,3,1,4,5,3,16,1,22,19,1,27,0,0,0,0,3,9,0,0,18,90,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25316191112045344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13416009808862628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09057449401486188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2988152708832955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16707984324577554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30363015602231863,0.5075833614949152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309944586570944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10360167068414304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13769057525482764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07118952795186319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960492082257527,0.0,0.12510655299299905,0.0,0.1215606414799173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359261080653769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224532693470042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3718450077685601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12790104691624085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21430682488316286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833723147561192,0.0,0.0,0.1082977897665362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12653772527908902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07640361384679696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11646830614387935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09201856736371704,0.0,0.0,0.16683370997040026
alcoholism,PROPERthinking,2019/01/16,"After quitting nightly drinking It was “hard” because I was craving it, Because it was easy, Because I thought it’s what I needed to fall asleep. It’s crazy to think I was so reliant on it. The fact is I never think about it anymore. It’s no longer my nightly needs. Some nights I’ll have a drink before bed but it’s really only once or twice a month. My body does not need it or want it anymore. I’m telling you this because I know how hard it was to go a single night without a buzz. You do not need it. Taper it down every night. Skip some nights. You’ll get used to not having it. It improved my energy levels a lot. It’s worth it I promise. I hope this helps someone.

alcoholism,Trips89,2019/01/16,Trouble retaining information after giving up alcohol I’m a 25 year old male I recently quit drinking in December and since then I’ve been trying to get my life back on track after 4 years of alcohol abuse. I decided to take a collage course I’m currently studying to get my CompTIA A+ certification (computer technition certification) but I noticed I’m having trouble retaining the information from the lectures as well as the information I read at home. It’s been very frustrating as I paid $450 out of pocket to take this course and I don’t want to piss it away. I know one of the symptoms of long term alcohol abuse is cognitive impairment that can take several months or even years to recover from. I just don’t have that kind of time I’m eager to get my education and start my career can anyone offer any advice on how I might be able to fix this problem?,4.5443956043956035,6.2690868095238095,6.377380952380952,72.35736263736264,70.78571428571428,10.407326007326008,31.970695970695967,10.560738912317856,3.85710750915751,696,32,125,22,13,241,106,168,0.151,0.7959999999999999,0.053,-0.9627,1,0,4,0,2,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,5,8,2,0,7,0,11,7,1,1,0,18,26,10,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,1,1,6,4,4,2,5,2,1,0,2,5,1,1,3,0,13,3,27,21,1,22,0,0,0,0,6,7,1,2,15,76,19,6,0.13819301384500848,0.3274722478349671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504061374350412,0.0,0.4430589138634192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09397598825497253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662776842804537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298368855432244,0.1062618975011404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13537654293826834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091275182315274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2166004380831329,0.13256733116399505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386188604561704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14390675820565987,0.07594726634968317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760981253168144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12229646857229355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466009492286622,0.0,0.0,0.11030434521282907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15733366219967082,0.14501032146325413,0.0,0.09364316264468668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13223205087549078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469852807384724,0.13823041083716153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13644892944253378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15611877056734313,0.0,0.11431468909979264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09781372647503578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14363545454492255,0.3117118442360192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058145769180336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938239851730906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402370916534105,0.08150982002331372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12425211576043528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2669753102407564
alcoholism,Dag_demo,2019/01/16,"I’ve finally had my first night without a drink and I’m proud of myself. Thanks to this sub I’ve found the way to quit. 4 years of heavy drinking every night because I needed to wind down...I realized I had a problem and it has caused a shit-ton of other problems. 
I felt so different this morning and I’m sad to admit that I haven’t woken up without a bit of a stumble or blood shot eyes for so long I cannot remember what a good morning feels like. 

What am I going to be up against? What’s helping you? I’m going to ask for help and admit my addiction with my spouse today but now that I’ve recognized how difficult taking this first step was I’m scared. 

I’m glad I’ve finally actually subscribed and equally proud of writing this post.

alcoholism,4q420,2019/01/16,"Seeking advice, or insight I’ve been dating my boyfriend since last March, things started out rocky but I’d been used to turbulent relationships; I craved it. I found out about his drinking problem after he began picking fights that would turn into shouting matches. 

Since this past summer, he’s been doing loads better, but I’m unsure of how to cope with the pain associated with loving someone in recovery. 

Though I’ve never given him reason to believe I’m cheating on him, nor have I even lied to him but he has an extreme distrust for me. On the other side, he lies about his drinking, putting himself in inappropriate situations. 

I want to explain how that double standard negatively impacts our relationship. On top of that, I am triggered by certain situations involving alcohol, such as conflict or sexual intimacy, throwing me into flashbacks.  Him being intoxicated while this happens makes it difficult for him to understand how irrational my thinking is as well. 

Ultimately, I’d like to know how to speak to my boyfriend in a way that he doesn’t feel attacked, nor will he feel demotivated. 

(We’ve considered couples therapy but only in passing; to learn how to spot triggers and how to de-escalate).

They give you videos to watch and you meet with a therapist once a week.,2.694489795918365,5.1794776326530645,3.885061224489796,84.66351020408162,78.79591836734693,7.185306122448982,24.08571428571429,8.238735603445708,1.7268253061224494,200,7,37,4,5,65,40,49,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,3,2,0,1,0,7,8,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,0,6,6,1,3,0,0,1,0,6,1,0,1,1,26,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22856564564603096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17078396056357414,0.3135779510589973,0.1857763218011698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2402981427917252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3481219376417433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27696866417351695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3742052055330233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3795387679844616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31235269853884273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2823237517606452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26220749062100923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,homegrowninidaho2,2019/01/18,"(long) Small step, huge win for me today. Almost caved. Been battling alcohol for a lot of years at this point. Thursday last week was my last drink, here's what happened. I left work early and went to the grocery store and bought a pint of vodka around 8pm. I came home and drank it alone standing in the kitchen. I decided that wasn't enough so I walked down to the 711 a few blocks away around 930. A homeless guy asked for a cigarette so I told him to hold on let me run in real quick. I went in and got a few earthquakes (10 % beer),and the guy some taquitos. I asked him if he was hungry and if he wanted to have a beer with me and he said fuck yeah thanks man. So we walk down the block and hung out at a playground and drank the beer. Then we go back to 711 and that's it. The next thing I vaguely remember is falling down a lot and trying to get up. I make it home and pass out on the front steps, it's probably about 20°f, and my SO wakes me up around 2:30 am or so I'm told. I still have my wallet but not my phone. Anyway, that made me make a huge decision to stop drinking. Today I went in for my first alcohol and drug class as ordered by the court for a dui I have been dealing with. It's supposed to be 16 one hour classes. I failed the ua for thc, I live in a legal state and do not have to do ua for my probation officer. Well, the guy tells me that I have failed to comply and now I need intensive outpatient treatment. This infuriated me a little bit. I tried to plead my case to no avail. On the way home I have my lady stop at the grocery store because I was hellbent on buying some beer. I went in, grabbed the beer, and some lady walked past carrying doughnuts. I don't eat sweets, ever. But something in my head told me that I have come to far to let a bit of bad news destroy what progress I have made so I put the beer down and went to the bakery and loaded up a box of a dozen doughnuts, brought them home and had coffee and sweets instead. I really still want that beer, but I am happy with the decision I made. Thank you for reading.",1.3685279934133163,3.035660961009178,2.7080733944954107,95.55892143025171,79.29816513761469,5.847941660785698,21.500588096918374,6.67199483983844,0.19356805457539394,1593,45,374,15,39,515,214,436,0.113,0.821,0.066,-0.9692,0,1,15,0,0,0,47.0,2,1,1,6,20,13,3,0,33,1,24,18,2,5,1,66,57,34,0,5,8,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,5,4,16,32,14,5,4,10,4,19,5,6,1,3,25,4,50,7,60,29,10,79,0,2,0,1,22,34,1,9,22,240,66,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734160546408833,0.08124440824613076,0.08403079693951945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21668052311363525,0.15169947277665302,0.0,0.0762284644318435,0.06238736581084445,0.06774385709855538,0.04945879330144549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1771555601025291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09279616940105503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0698901242536525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364603106931663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15896169944464988,0.09409017620648713,0.08302077349019472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08383355112221609,0.0,0.0,0.07339073375766847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06901290169089244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07500746987036379,0.04238938912020511,0.0,0.04611056429516863,0.0,0.06489061260303475,0.0,0.0,0.2410075143657873,0.07174690535924275,0.08636910564463382,0.0,0.0,0.08326732882037402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255377801048091,0.0,0.07990106676769072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322707728489136,0.0,0.0,0.08815279173413385,0.16593089614154832,0.0,0.0,0.08131801008159181,0.07164318500701561,0.07180141425681051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13795517594661386,0.0,0.23031406816626546,0.10831571934914253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06016014916214564,0.0,0.0,0.08628738297965399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497878713803104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745199059830858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669825795953808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08747663433379814,0.0,0.0,0.08156250806127915,0.0,0.0,0.08115638257813683,0.09234873988665793,0.05197679114964253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09190948895674188,0.0,0.07717741915072829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06246124535070489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12958811553728147,0.13566402694277807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07091506486196943,0.14939535824251135,0.0,0.0,0.053902107763859036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538118989503873,0.2325822642375199,0.0,0.11016989951194933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09571037368151633,0.0644007312193742,0.06508114294508947,0.0,0.07294959323152002,0.3760621308512722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05906682876200954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052247910537186366
alcoholism,ItsAlexBalex,2019/01/18,"Employee is an alcoholic and in denial about it. How can I help? Hi everybody,

I run a small business that has two full time employees and one part time. One of my full time employees has been working here for almost 3 years. For the most part, she’s very valuable to our store. She’s knowledgeable, works hard, and is good with customers. 

However, within a few months of her first starting, the other full time employee asked me if I ever noticed the smell of alcohol on her. I hadn’t, but I did notice her hands seemed to shake a lot. A few days later, I started noticing the smell. A few weeks later, a customer actually pulled me aside and said they noticed these symptoms. After the customer pointed it out, I told her what happened and she acted to confused as to how they came to that conclusion. I simply told her “Whatever may have led the customer to believe that, do your best to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

Things were good for a while after that, probably close to a year. Then we started noticing the smell again. There’s been several incidents over the last year of her clearly being drunk at work, oversleeping (I assume from being in an alcohol induced coma), and consistently catching wiffs. My other full time employee and I had another sit down with her about it and she again feigned ignorance as if she was shocked to hear this was an issue. After a little more prodding, she admitted she drinks a lot, but claimed it never happened at work. I suggested AA to her, but she claimed her mother (who was also an alcoholic) tried that and it “made things worse.” We told her that she’s a really good worker and it would be unfortunate to have to let her go, but this behavior wouldn’t be tolerated.

Since that talk, nothing seems to have changed. She hasn’t appeared blatantly intoxicated while at work since, but I still smell it and she calls in sick from time to time, usually the day after she already had a day off. This leads me to believe that her sick days are usually alcohol related, but they may be legitimate. 

As I said, she’s a really good worker, and truth be told, we’d have a hard time finding an adequate replacement if we ever lost her, but I think she knows that and possibly feels that losing her job isn’t a real threat. I don’t think she believes she has a problem, but it’s clear she does. She recently separated from her husband and lived in my basement for a couple months until she could find her own place. While she was living there I saw several pints of liquor that would show up in the trash day after day.

I’ve never had anyone in my life with alcoholism, so I’m not sure how to handle this. I’d really appreciate some input with people that are more experienced with this problem. Thank you for reading, I appreciate it.

TLDR: Employee continues to drink before and possibly during work despite warnings. How can I get through to her?",5.0011413043478266,6.437398425724638,5.6535942028985495,79.1084347826087,69.27173913043478,9.143188405797103,30.10434782608696,9.516144504307137,2.793936086956521,2289,90,423,50,40,742,253,552,0.091,0.81,0.1,0.6385,8,0,8,0,0,0,65.0,5,2,3,14,17,19,1,2,32,0,44,17,1,9,10,86,75,40,0,9,12,2,4,0,0,5,12,3,0,0,34,26,10,1,13,6,1,10,9,9,1,4,22,13,72,10,64,39,17,85,0,2,1,0,64,25,0,15,49,314,106,11,0.0,0.0,0.05674398744355935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3728546912988031,0.05822674803494138,0.0,0.0641676818360529,0.04650087509165076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060973169999481214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04065838158403172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0543604610402236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049479601885955474,0.1965383997377008,0.06102266047212562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059375533362361885,0.06650573609883233,0.0,0.0,0.06151279514183676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04642638704943227,0.06433957368185511,0.0,0.22500360931320101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050885641541886864,0.0,0.0,0.11392565987715858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519625546809844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029401338331516893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10629230111432247,0.04946059580792318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030379891157307014,0.0,0.03304680613624402,0.1950868847244652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15426005570685056,0.0,0.10417823983669304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06553693821032211,0.0,0.03897532882200006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060691327017910926,0.05770284378290855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03195657920848016,0.04739832026179752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0594601935654205,0.04107159948761725,0.0,0.058279497456357764,0.1026913672430584,0.0,0.0,0.06505265507970506,0.06347532971626978,0.09887057390613764,0.0,0.05502097315789983,0.03881419186203691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09282623889590508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896945298526178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05579450286854333,0.3310089934701788,0.0,0.0,0.07880507852933417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12593707389512615,0.0,0.040312450102326966,0.0,0.060752206093775685,0.0,0.054968584759698194,0.1311060984484927,0.0,0.0,0.06269329860669325,0.11127942349487943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05816366125147485,0.06618506953038036,0.11175315030049984,0.0,0.057414061509020224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11062398596744118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058713751603028,0.0,0.1313812095512416,0.0,0.09620112987583647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12347220306985285,0.0,0.04643700849449853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10960746344547158,0.06043795913834124,0.0,0.0467370999905912,0.0,0.05353479746952794,0.0,0.0,0.07726179598256723,0.07451768562445242,0.0,0.0,0.27125218423071257,0.0,0.0,0.22225133913014766,0.0,0.03947862455027845,0.0,0.05680207408421616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12808344993608145,0.04797812836093115,0.0,0.0,0.04664275848510718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539942942383867,0.0,0.059257703899601076,0.08261323599723433,0.0,0.0,0.1123360728895134
alcoholism,Alej915,2019/01/18,"Just quit after 8 years of heavy substance abuse 33m. Tobacco was easy. Cocaine was somehow easier and I was using so much of that daily. Alcohol has been the hardest. Just quit 3 days ago, and the withdrawals today have been crippling to say the least. Holy fucking shit. Was drinking a handle of vodka every two days with beers or wine intertwined. Finally fed up with out I feel daily. Luckily my work is very supportive, and I can work from home when I need to. I knew the nausea would be a thing but the pain was not expected. My 'why' is my girlfriend. I finally have love, real love, and I want to share a better life with her. I'm doing this without support groups bc I do not like many folks. Lucky for me the cravings have subsided and today will stick in my mind forever. Anyone who reads this and is considering doing the same I will say this: stop making excuses. You're not convincing anyone except yourself. And you can't trust yourself. I'm lucky. Good luck to all you people going through this shit.

alcoholism,onTheUpUp,2019/01/18,"3 months of Drinks per Night compared to Level of Happiness Here are [plots](https://imgur.com/gallery/XTz8oGA) tracking my drinking &amp; happiness for the last 3 months.
I've been doing CBT and reading, making some progress and now reading *This Naked Mind* by Annie Grace which gives a good overview of how alcohol can end up changing neurochemistry and conscious/unconscious beliefs so things become boring without it. Going to try to continue letting my brain naturally re-program to not think joy and excitement depend on booze.
The gist:
* alcohol increases cravings (but not pleasure) by releasing dopamine via the ventral tegmental area of the brain (VTA)
* alcohol artificially activates the pleasure centre of the brain, the nucleus accumbens. The brain tries to compensate for this overstimulation, leading to tolerance and the eventual numbing of the pleasure centre
* alcohol damages the prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making, decreasing one's ability to exercise self-control and making it more difficult to abstain

alcoholism,tamayo1997,2019/01/19,"Turning 21 is Supposed to be Fun Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right spot to post this but I figured I’d give it a shot. I’m 21 now but have been drinking since I was 12 (also have been using a wide range of substances). Up until this point in my life, there have never really been any problems that arose from my substance abuse. It has always seemed “normal” to me. What I’ve started to realize is my behavior is not normal at all, and that realization came through the destruction of relationships. I’m in my senior year of college, and my academics have never suffered from my substance abuse, nor have I ever gotten fired from a job as a result. This makes me think that I’m a functioning alcoholic.    
My girlfriend of six and a half years can’t stand my drinking, and I feel like every time I try to curb back on it I last for a week or two and then binge. I tell myself things like “you’ve been good”, or “you haven’t drank in a week, you deserve it”. But it always spirals out of control. One week I’ll drink two 30 racks and sneak several nips, and the next week I’ll have 5 beers total because I realize it’s getting out of hand. Drinking is comfortable for me, but it reeks havoc on my relationships. It seems as though I’m incapable of having just 1 drink. I will drink until the sun comes up or I pass out, which I’ve only recently realized is a serious problem. I guess I’m here to ask for any advice or similar issues that others can relate to.

alcoholism,tacotimesnewroman,2019/01/19,"How do I taper off? I am 100% sober.

I posted here a few weeks ago about wanting to quit. I make it a day or so before withdrawal scares me off. I've been researching detox facilities but I want to do outpatient if possible so I don't lose my job. I've looked up meeting locations but I'm drunk when the meetings come up.

For the last week I've been trying to taper off. I've been keeping track of how many drinks I have in a day and at what time. I was averaging 15 a day and now I'm at 9. This is a hump I can't get over for some reason. I got as low as 8 but bounced back to 10.

Am I doing this wrong? Should I leave detox to the professionals and just check myself in somewhere?

I guess I'm looking for reassurance. I am serious about getting well, it's just hard and I feel so defeated whenever I fail.",-0.20665714285714287,1.8508595771428595,2.52192857142857,92.56632142857143,87.51428571428568,6.242857142857144,20.17857142857143,7.554174236665415,0.6316571428571427,626,20,148,12,20,218,107,175,0.166,0.764,0.07,-0.9531,1,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,4,14,9,0,1,8,0,15,5,0,4,0,23,30,17,0,4,7,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,5,5,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,7,1,0,5,4,19,2,23,24,2,24,0,4,2,1,3,11,0,4,11,93,24,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547686700398343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342534172007153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485681929436369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503988489926665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33779960192997033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1710374454595716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828089838123401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18243823147439692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964023601539682,0.0,0.1923369924118203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15640357083167558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17325942210074738,0.15518879715561767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14231890559850746,0.0,0.1848717758206833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29323305060979865,0.19532807546943448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11654407322843167,0.17701276915557107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19683056641480276,0.16721454375016254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18570415813565366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1795135935893859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17480088573557342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180823336063016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11853910875948245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20596228998127414,0.0,0.2801004890059877,0.0,0.15698262055858986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19089313313962344,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,lonelyrelation,2019/01/20,"Hello my people So I've been sober almost four years, I got sober when I was 18. I was diagnosed with MDD around 6 or so months when I was really down and went to a psychiatrist and for therapy. I quit the zoloft and therapy about a month or two in, deciding I hadnt been sober long enough and that there were many things I could do to improve my life to change my thinking.

Most of the past 3 years since has been very routine, I had the same job and apartment for almost 2 years. But since then, I started college, moved around a couple times, worked 3 different jobs,  and many other life shit kinda things happened (car accident, losing friends). Through that, Ive worked a program in AA, which has had a lot of ups and downs, and definitely mostly downs lately.

So the point I'm at right now is I really just need a freaking rocket, something big needs to change, and I know im working hard to have the lifestyle changes with my education, but my patience and faith has been worn really thin. Ive never been so ready to relapse since Ive been sober, because I feel if I could just drink sometime and smoke a little weed to really get outta myself, that could be all I need. 

Before I do that, I'm seriously considering trying therapy again, I never gave professional help a fair shot in my life, and it just doesn't make sense I could be so worn out and depressed when I've worked so hard to be where I'm at today. I dont have a gratifying sense of accomplishment like a lot of people seem to get.

For a solid length of time AA worked great, I sponsored a lot of people, and truly felt i had tapped into something. Now I do a meeting at rehab, or uphold a position at my home group, or get a sponsee, and it feels fruitless. I'm cynical about the whole experience, probably because a lot of my inner circle in AA has given up on the program, saying theyre not alchoholics and it's not a real thing, all the great mental obsession stuff ya know. Young people groups in AA are a tough lot man. I have been using a meditation app the past couple days, and I'm hoping to rekindle that fire I had, but make it brighter then it was. I want this to work, I want to continue to inspire others and be something different from most of the world

Anyways, that's where I've been at lately. It's tough to say you're having a hard time when there's people who cant even get sober, nevermind pursue a college degree and other goals, I feel guilty and ungrateful, but something needs to change for me internally

alcoholism,trydryforlife,2019/01/20,"Concerned Hi - I am 40, 7 months out of rehab I fell off the wagon last week. I drank heavily for two days. About 15 hours after my last drink I started diarrhea. That was Friday afternoon. It’s Sunday afternoon, and I’ve had constant runs since then. Imodium hasn’t fixed it. I am not jaundiced or in pain or lethargic or dehydrated, but I am worried about this diarrhea. I had a high fever and sweats last night but it passed. I have been around folks who are sick with various things late last week, too. I don’t want to overreact, but I’ve not had the runs this long after alcohol, and I’m paranoid now about hurting my body with alcohol. If I’m having pancreatitis or liver failure or something, but other than the runs I’m not having other issues, so I’m tempted to just deal with it instead of going to the doc. Anyone have post-bender experience relevant to this? Needless to say, I am back on the wagon again.",3.417311233885819,5.23413010497238,4.827602209944754,81.94313443830572,73.9171270718232,7.920589318600367,26.983793738489872,8.648137234880735,2.080833959484345,723,27,138,14,15,241,112,181,0.13699999999999998,0.855,0.008,-0.9704,0,0,4,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,0,11,2,0,0,6,0,16,11,3,0,0,23,24,15,0,2,14,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,12,8,4,0,0,1,0,6,5,2,0,1,6,1,12,0,22,18,1,35,0,1,0,0,4,6,0,6,23,94,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3342310274145533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10933985517929434,0.0,0.0,0.1392054001977424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12024142410474525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17369549710643611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16898399696796446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10084784940048754,0.16121401770638824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1531863132135381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15296310421809378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887055648310033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16521698896625606,0.0,0.0,0.15399621270698788,0.0,0.16740086402481413,0.0,0.0,0.1632131100216691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5098604785786311,0.1763959063815809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13838545979245268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12481568525717004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14674575971393627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16639222844928395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497624067287998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435433357657875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12935361909289025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203838148110936,0.0,0.0,0.1106818346456132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388747970902873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275400328996278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09223303054624576,0.0,0.2508664761967493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15880468825018673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,questionman1234321,2019/01/20,"Hey any advice on a friend being enabled by other toxic people? What is the best most compassionate “non-enabling” way to handle this situation?

I have an alcoholic friend who stays over my place for recovery and sometimes goes to see an enabler to get drunk. (But never admits it).

This person is aware they are endangering my friend but their clingy obsession with my friend means they are happy to be an enabler, consciously, to keep my friends company. 

My friend will probably not live through the year if the addiction continues and has expressed the desire to stop but still lies about drinking when she is away.

I can’t afford to worry about her 24/7 but I also don’t want her to feel like help isn’t there anymore and she only has the enabler to turn to.

What is the best way to deal with this situation without being judgy or making things worse?

alcoholism,cdromney,2019/01/21,"Anyone have experience with Antabuse? I’ve just started taking it after I relapsed and kept drinking while on naltrexone. However ever since talking it I’ve been a lot more anxious, and absolutely exhausted. I can barely stay awake at work and all I want to do is sleep when I get home. I drink coffee with extra espresso powder and have even taken caffeine pills on occasion and nothing works. On top of that I’m always at least slightly nauseous. It’s not debilitating but I just don’t feel like eating. Do these sound like sound effects or just withdrawal?

alcoholism,leoexec,2019/01/21,"Interesting form of alcoholism... I never crave alcohol, except after the occasional night of binge drinking, then it’s on I could go months without a drink. I generally do not crave alcohol at all. There are situations where everyone is drinking, and I’ll say no.

Why do I say no? Is it because of fears of alcoholism? Nope, I generally just don’t enjoy it

However, this month we had my birthday party. All my friends know I’ve been going through a rough time, so they through a celebration for me, with a bunch of alcohol. I really do have great friends.

I ended up drinking so much I had a brutal hangover, and now I had kept this hair-of the-dog thing going for a while (currently sober),

It’s just strange. I get momentum and I can’t stop, and I don’t even like alcohol, but I know situation will make this happen again once it goes away. 

Am I an alcoholic? I don’t really understand, because I don’t really drink very often. I suppose I’m just prone to alcoholism,",2.7125672514619907,4.946541110526319,4.860350877192985,79.01690058479534,77.36842105263158,9.064327485380117,28.450292397660817,9.586721724236666,3.0232573099415205,761,34,147,23,18,263,112,190,0.064,0.847,0.08900000000000001,0.6237,2,0,13,0,0,0,32.0,1,0,1,0,11,8,1,1,8,0,19,13,0,1,3,26,30,9,0,1,7,0,1,1,2,1,8,2,0,0,9,6,13,2,3,5,0,3,11,2,0,0,5,3,22,6,18,23,5,21,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,1,14,104,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7360629374816631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08088776377367682,0.0,0.0,0.10496370926310372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06873872776528908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216947202589116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625336863843914,0.0,0.0,0.056864005591533213,0.0,0.0,0.08226611667881756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687922651750996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330313913314768,0.0,0.044980348472470164,0.0,0.14678691719600484,0.0,0.0,0.09491848918975304,0.0,0.0,0.07613227913543615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946295733149658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04206098032809665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0574681412316981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374381676124706,0.0,0.06328869622411447,0.0,0.06640068570283117,0.0,0.0,0.08079300401399164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168686575931834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16546127888953244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369301599091539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935456093243889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07197809798297006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05719675704086408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0502018658799635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896264655942183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07103622990474487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0776860758378679,0.0,0.0,0.08299115049454647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,LiamBCool,2019/01/21,"Is it possible to have drank very little (2-3 drinks every weekend) for years and be an alcoholic? Okay, so I drank a crapton in college, which I dropped out of during junior year.

Mostly at parties, sometimes alone 

After college, I became a much more restricted consumer of alcohol. But when I dropped out, I slowly crept into a suicidal depressive phase that honestly lasted for 3 years and gradually tapered off..sort of..in the last 2 years 

Anyway, my question is...can I benefit from alcohol-specific treatment if it's just been like 5 years of on and off drinking? If I can control myself when drinking, am I an alcoholic?

Starting to become very confused and annoyed. 

Thank you for any responses.

alcoholism,absoinsane11,2019/01/22,"Need some advice So I'm gonna start this really honestly... I'm not sure if I have a problem. I'm a 29 year old male in the military and I drink on average about 3 nights a week. When I drink it's pretty heavy, at the very least 750mL to a 1L if not more of bourbon/rum/whiskey, but I'm not crazy about it. It's not like I'm doing crazy things to get it. The thing that scares me is I've been off the for the past month in the middle of a big PCS across the coast, and I haven't had a sober day in 2 weeks. It's not like I'm putting them back as soon as I wake up and I've been productive, but part of this really feels like the start of something worse. I can't go to bed without a few drinks because my thoughts fuck me up pretty bad without it. I've been to psych and they advised me to not drink and stick to a strict medication schedule, but at the same time, it just feels like I'm numbing things. I've got a family that relies on me heavily, and the last thing I want to do is let them down. I'm not sure why I'm even posting this. Maybe I just want some advice. I know there's negative comments coming my way because at the end of the day, I could use some honest answers and little bit of hard truths.

alcoholism,rclimpson,2019/01/22,"Drinking vodka daily Hi, I wanted to get some feedback from y’all about my current drinking habits. 

Basically for the last 12 months I’ve drank vodka everyday. During weekdays it might just be two or three vodka sodas. Weekends/Thursday/Friday it might be six or seven. 

The thing is it doesn’t really interfere with my everyday life. I workout 5 or 6 days a week, I’m healthy in terms of body fat/weight.  At my job I’m paid extremely well and am performing well.  

There are times where I’ll have 10+ drinks and become rather belligerent but nothing “bad” has really happened aside from my wife being pissed off because I’m being a cunt. 

So yeah,  I dunno if I have an issue or not. Quite often I’ll think “I won’t drink today” but find myself making a vodka soda or three when I get home. I’m not sure I could go a day or week without drinking at this point. 

Would love some feedback...",2.0605649717514147,4.377529096045201,3.578333333333333,86.92196327683618,80.07344632768361,5.967231638418079,22.262711864406786,7.1686216300943375,0.889528813559322,698,22,134,9,18,230,123,177,0.073,0.8220000000000001,0.105,0.5445,3,0,9,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,2,10,7,2,0,7,1,16,12,2,1,1,31,30,13,0,5,14,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,0,5,3,8,1,2,10,1,1,5,3,2,5,2,0,13,4,12,19,3,20,0,0,0,1,4,6,2,13,13,82,18,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10683397035871206,0.07799790983051319,0.14131213096297401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14212502232342955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10215868184806703,0.0,0.0,0.16503597486503932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6267176912414975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169451476040477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13369852071468413,0.0,0.07271765839914926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11314689019444855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283455616490862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13354788864268466,0.12697189754331642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10429736681000196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09037576972292168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11548102152205356,0.0,0.0854084698299208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714721662712136,0.0,0.0,0.10212948722913168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12277269952860315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095531267865875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13609193113005502,0.0,0.0,0.16393772669139298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12059256274214533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08500514186457535,0.08198601077504916,0.0,0.0,0.07460941759239667,0.0,0.1212828480475856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12498980393415585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754689772833323,0.0,0.2052695903096152,0.15581018305798813,0.2300871256751192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12334046345062975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089291488151613,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Weird_Day,2019/01/22,"I've hit my newest low and need some feedback I'm in my late 30s and on my second convicted DUI. I have about eight more months until probation is over though I may be able to drive again if I can scrounge up enough money and convince the DMV to allow me to get my license back early. Problem is, I'm still drinking almost daily and it just cost me my job today because I drank at work due to, well, alcoholism.

I've already isolated myself from most of my friends and while I still have family, it's small and the person I'm living with is an overbearing (sober) bully that makes our living situation unsteady even at the best of times. He'll never know why I lost my job (I'd definitely be out on my ass if he did and while I wouldn't blame him for it, I'd prefer to not be homeless) but just losing it is possibly problem enough.

Thankfully, my work history is pretty good. I've left on good terms with every job before this going back well over ten years and the job I lost was at a mega-corp that will most assuredly just confirm my employment when contacted and not the reasons, but not having a car, it being just after the holidays, and having almost no savings or much food, the next few weeks are gonna be rough. I have a 401(k) I can try to cash out and if the government ever gets \*its\* crap in order, maybe I'll get my tax return in a month or so. Between now and then? Well, I got lots of fat to burn, so there's that.

I'm hoping to be able to get another job within a week or two, but if I don't, what can I do to try to get a handle on the alcoholism? I usually drink about three to six 24oz 10% ABV beers a day but don't have any physical dependencies. It's purely mental and emotional so I'm lucky in that regard at least. I've also managed to be sober for weeks and months at a time, but I always fall hard off the wagon, and each time it gets worse. I know there's AA, of course, and counseling but I'm leery of the former and the latter costs money I don't have. I am guessing any kind of assistance will? Are there options I'm unaware of? Or just AA, poverty, and determination?",4.036916693784576,4.317991792710707,5.442638301334204,83.96680808656038,70.70842824601367,8.549332899446794,25.929140904653433,8.527137837955566,1.5484844777090792,1643,45,353,25,28,555,228,439,0.077,0.79,0.133,0.9748,7,0,5,0,0,0,51.0,1,0,0,6,27,21,1,0,21,0,35,10,3,4,4,72,63,42,0,10,22,0,2,0,1,6,3,0,0,1,14,23,8,0,4,4,6,4,9,7,5,6,6,2,34,14,50,43,13,63,0,4,0,1,7,23,2,20,35,237,48,12,0.16722951983458806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17871749895864925,0.1674562078602481,0.0,0.09227096678145404,0.06686669329667934,0.06957417848994954,0.0,0.0,0.11372180803210398,0.08767736627850341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12858917829057664,0.0,0.050970781561439575,0.0,0.07115000217155118,0.0,0.08774853191245978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053924602870154915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16382126449477405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940553506679498,0.0,0.1727927972575655,0.0,0.05522676033579062,0.07563433738053936,0.07044904150534459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882455412696038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10110729959148952,0.0,0.06460055609672141,0.0,0.2621115659090322,0.0,0.04752019496389665,0.14026418708642374,0.06687436185954451,0.0,0.09211108486028567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490240127329142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830483231305355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4148737362440219,0.0,0.0,0.08707190546794022,0.09190497067132188,0.0,0.094321091189296,0.0,0.0908476813036256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14766672980077214,0.0,0.0,0.09354352852018316,0.1825507754715561,0.07108627878957277,0.0,0.0,0.05581350152404529,0.0,0.08400226492451524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426401159521521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20022151090392826,0.0,0.06146646937679415,0.06199928499989765,0.06448885753465862,0.0,0.08892524576081162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07300918318814334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426307845821226,0.0,0.08506627088469279,0.0,0.1600160656417283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08596989921357724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09398649346814672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13354971055907916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07698123693456049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08215107708341715,0.0,0.14626931675958438,0.0,0.07925701558433773,0.0,0.0,0.11353786673370375,0.0,0.08167947073939047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208984504459684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20121215052325364,0.0,0.22553913268387446,0.0,0.07544931538141235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1217450821335487,0.0,0.08521058376450873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05384516396914865

alcoholism,crankgoon94,2019/01/22,"88 days in and I still hate myself. I no longer enjoy the simple things. Sure not drinking has kept me out of trouble the last couple months, but im not happy. Everyday I get more and more frustrated about what I’m doing in my life. I literally feel like I can’t enjoy anything. I just recently got engaged to the love of my life, won thousands at the casino, got a raise at work, but at the end of the day I still feel down. I’m not sleeping, and feeling depressed more and more. This is the longest time I’ve had not drinking, but at this point I’d rather be drinking and somewhat happy then not drinking at all and being this depressed.

I’ve gained so much weight as a result of 10+ beers every single day and my skin seems to have gotten worse, even though I used to have good skin, never had much acne or breakouts.

alcoholism,monolife,2019/01/22,"I want to so badly - why can't I stay sober? I have so much going on this very moment, so this will not be linear. I'm in a very bad place mentally and physically and I cannot write properly. But I'm sober.

I just wanted to vent to random strangers on the internet because I don't have anyone else. I'm really alone right now and actually pretty concerned for myself - and not just about my inability to stay sober. I've tried to kill myself in the past. I've gotten drunk and stumbled down to the basement to my father's gun safe and tried to crack the code. There's a hospital literally across the street from my building, but I don't have health insurance because I've been unemployed since October. I've got a job interview in a few hours and I don't even want to go because I keep trembling over everything on my mind - a fresh breakup, losing my best friend and the woman I truly believe is the love of my life...I'm financially struggling...I'm mentally struggling...I can't pull it together enough to be charming and convince these people to hire me. I just want a safe space where I know I won't drink or otherwise hurt myself. I went to a SMART Recovery meeting this morning but it didn't help very much. Probably because I was hungover and she's all I can think about. If you knew her, if you saw her, she'd be all you could think about, too.

But she hates my fucking guts right now and doesn't want to ever talk to me or see me ever again. Because I hurt her again.

She broke up with me again 2 days ago because I'm a fucking alcoholic and I relapsed. So I drank yesterday, too, because why the fuck not? I'm sad already. Why not be drunk and miserable, right? I texted her a little this morning after reading a post she made on r/codependency about me/us but then deleted. She asked me to please leave her alone. I can't do that unless I blocked her, so I'm trying. I want her in my life so badly but she made her decision and I don't think it's the wrong move on her part. But holy fucking shit - I love this woman more than anything.

I stopped drinking at first because she wanted me to and left me over my problem. I want to stop drinking because it's what I want to do. I am better than I was. I tapered my drinking down severely. But it's not enough.

It's my fault. It's my fault every time, and I say that with sincerity, not bitterness. I've had a drinking problem for about 7 years. I started dating this woman in June and it got serious, fast. I moved from my hometown, the only place I ever really knew, to a completely different city because she was going to school here. But I had a drinking problem and she knew it. She prodded me and poked me and broke up with me a few times over my drinking. She wasn't wrong. I'm a fucking trainwreck, my friends.

I gradually acquiesced into programs and meetings - after she broke up with me in December, I went back home and lived with my parents for a month while I did outpatient treatment. It really helped. And she and I talked through some things and decided to try again. I was upset she requested we do not tell anyone we're back together, such as family, friends, etc., because I took it like she's ashamed of me. She told her family I'm an alcoholic and why she left me. I assumed they all hated me and think I'm a fucking leper or diseased freak or something. It hurt me, but I agreed and didn't tell a soul we were back together.

But I came back to the city I moved to (I mean, shit, I've got another like 10 months on my fucking lease) and I've drank about 5 times since I've been back, including the last 2 days. And every time I've drank, it's been a binge. I lied to her to cover them up but she knew, every time. She can tell. Everybody can.

So she left me again over my drinking.

She apparently had a nightmare where I got drunk and killed myself in my bathroom and my roommate (who is a heavy drinker and pot smoker) didn't notice because he was too drunk/stoned and just playing video games.

That is......eerily possible, unfortunately.

I don't know where this is going or why I'm saying this. I can't talk to her because she asked me not to. She left me. I'm trying very hard to respect that. I really do love her more than anything. I'm just not in a spot to control my drinking to where it needs to be in order to be with someone. True, she is very controlling and judgmental, but I don't think she's totally out of line here. She cared about me and wanted what's best for me. But I don't care enough about myself to commit to that, apparently.

So I took to Googling bridges nearby to jump off, or thought about trying to go to a rough neighborhood around here and trying to buy a gun off a random person. How fucking bizarre is that? I need serious help. I can't stay sober. I can't accept it's over with her. I can't KILL MYSELF over it. That's not normal. That is aberrant psychology. 

But She didn't ruin my life. I did.",2.1386642319610445,4.006340805776894,3.6399495351925673,88.83521868083227,77.69521912350598,6.772979194333776,24.70137228862329,7.715138304826218,1.2170116777335105,3835,136,813,58,90,1266,352,1004,0.166,0.7140000000000001,0.12,-0.9934,7,2,14,2,0,4,133.0,2,3,2,7,52,65,16,4,38,0,62,34,3,5,9,148,141,73,3,19,39,2,2,2,3,2,5,2,1,4,37,50,17,8,17,16,1,15,32,42,0,1,41,7,157,23,106,90,18,112,1,10,2,11,83,50,10,12,44,532,194,7,0.0,0.0,0.039036903185078985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035460014846568515,0.08550152560692692,0.0,0.0828615476366739,0.04414401765361423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04194636015885542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05594169099013485,0.0409875338153055,0.0658376921357378,0.035610919134886766,0.0747943227230616,0.0,0.0,0.15379818686542412,0.10020184943808433,0.31700888236218605,0.0,0.0,0.045069388719184936,0.0839608140445088,0.035379172206823566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045752477016614834,0.08157091771224277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04194211117178824,0.0,0.08973294746713688,0.03193893235445158,0.0,0.0,0.05159691513154736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04179434851880275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35268709864723263,0.0,0.0,0.033417155725194714,0.0,0.0,0.12400056960422727,0.04461362867213396,0.026421432095638058,0.10855430394873762,0.10111209973310503,0.0,0.03595188277678276,0.0,0.07542204509811631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0340263096940568,0.0,0.0,0.09271805167668888,0.29585510380166463,0.0,0.0,0.11367239330861095,0.0,0.1279753800561793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035834597159231894,0.07898884671987359,0.0,0.042521041364556734,0.0,0.0,0.08043897898492122,0.0,0.04012600923728365,0.0,0.03939464036594397,0.0,0.1284712796363451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039696546325681405,0.03555627278920825,0.1327713127252328,0.0,0.0439689188190578,0.03260757170150494,0.0,0.042357125079808766,0.1738523735968152,0.0,0.08476535356891468,0.03908663570405399,0.04009325397059529,0.0353231517700266,0.0,0.0,0.04475283307865282,0.0,0.0,0.10831210234587488,0.07570311848282188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043574710406157485,0.0,0.0,0.08062670513107023,0.0,0.04039136328990048,0.0,0.06385960987353485,0.1275497437430776,0.05881323245915991,0.05932304877718141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03919419122141008,0.0,0.04554338393768433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030423885902442244,0.0,0.0,0.04441830809321254,0.04331906852638872,0.03818714115692681,0.027732862681938343,0.034928849062207334,0.0835886970376055,0.04391099525862555,0.0,0.04509707814592568,0.038311566561997516,0.040697167209217726,0.043129718906289416,0.11483165733942635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04001356470448865,0.0,0.10250711674072062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248636261646303,0.0,0.06362356791874083,0.0,0.04048490791216375,0.031877004125759896,0.0,0.0,0.04519170918938056,0.08212447426850157,0.06618135880904663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033894191275665966,0.030796063143364773,0.0,0.0,0.0283141448368162,0.12791279298399053,0.0,0.06688816267679147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09645805994681547,0.10489247227026542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026576042551439825,0.12816070082276515,0.0,0.03175770673035249,0.11662959517393555,0.0,0.0,0.038224331771746535,0.08888903071922982,0.1901146394034312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048118370084904924,0.0,0.0,0.16503224713366038,0.2359465213046502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07416588037909423,0.18048125137990936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087473431586597,0.0,0.02576045262911024

Second, and more concerning, when you think of the average college drinker you think of someone going to parties or the bars and drinking socially. And in my mind that seems somewhat acceptable for our stage in life. However, thats not me. Sure, I drink socially, but I will also sit in my room alone and polish off half a handle of bonded on a tuesday. Go to class at 9, get home at 4, and do the same thing again. I do not think I am an alcoholic *yet* but I fear I am on the path. Like i mentioned, I am in pharmacy school, and like any other doctorate program it requires an insane amount of studying. So, when I have to study or have a project to complete, I don't drink. But, if you give me just one day with nothing to do I will get drunk. last week I bought an 18 pack of my favorite beer to use as a ""dinner beer"" where I would just have one with my meal. I killed all 18 in one night. Making this post is something I have thought about and battled for a long time, because I don't want to hear ""you should stop drinking"". I love drinking, school is fucking hard, life is fucking hard, and being able to wash it all out brings me back to baseline. I dont really know what I am trying to get by making this post, but i feel like I am going down the wrong path, and maybe its not too late. Also, I am drunk right now. Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I just dont know anymore.

alcoholism,Avenntus,2019/01/22,"I binged last Friday and threw up off a medium amount (not normal for me), then woke up with a sharp stomach pain the next day. Today I took one shot and felt instantly drunk and dizzy...what could be going on? I’ve been reading about “reverse tolerance” from liver damage, however I can’t seem to figure out if this is potentially that or something else. I binge drink about once a week and have a very high tolerance...can easily drink 15 drinks in a night without blacking out. I usually don’t feel buzzed til about 4 drinks in, so this incident was very scary and I was panicking a bit thinking something could be wrong.

alcoholism,Degoy13,2019/01/23,"I can't stay sober... So a few years ago I was in a really bad place with my girlfriend of about 5 years breaking up with me and my friends passing, I was not a heavy drinker at the time, I had a few beers sometimes when at the skatepark with my friends after working all day. But going through my friends passing and my girlfriend breaking up w me, whiskey was pretty much my only friend. I was drinking heavily almost everyday since until a couple weeks ago when I decided to go sober. It only lasted about a week and a half until I fell back into it. Getting shitfaced drunk and forgetting all worries is such a relief but ofcourse the aftermath is unbelievably horrible. Everyday I wonder why I keep doing this to myself and why I cant stop.

I don't know why I decided to post this but I guess I just wanted to share my story and also get some tips on how to stay sober.

alcoholism,tubthumping575,2019/01/23,"The tipping point Hey,

I know I have been a substance addict for a while now, when I was younger it was weed, few years later research  chemicals &amp; illegal drugs etc 

I know I'm an addict, but lately alcohol has been my crutch, which it never used to be, k was a weed guy from 18-26, didn't really drink at all.

I've stopped for 6 months in the past, most recently a month and now a week.

 I'm not to the point of physical withdrawals but I know I've got a problem, I realize when being sober that I'm a twat for drinking, it ruins my work, social life, family etc etc.but hindsight is a beautiful thing.

I can't stop at one drink, and for me, that's the definition of an alcoholic.

I find myself being able to tolerate a lot more than I used to, I used to drink beer/cider but now I'm drinking gin, I can drink 700ml of gin a night and smoke half gram of weed (25 ounces for the yanks) when I have no commitments but baseline is 350ml gin half gram of weed 

Since moving to spirits my tolerance has shot up I'm going to try and stick to two days drinking/smoking weed every 8 days ( why 8 days you ask?,I work 4 days on the. 4 off)


, I've tries tried this before but I can't seem to stick to it, I always fall back into the same patterns.

I realise I have a problem, and that I'm in a crossroads, i either give up intoxicants for life (fantastic idea when sober) or stick to two day a week.

What you guys think, 

Any tips for staying on this rota or should I just give in to the fact I'm an addict and call it a day.",2.7302234863876467,3.52878503738318,4.226252201002303,89.62053230394152,74.01557632398755,7.576378166057157,24.548422050656924,7.893859768569023,1.0565055126642284,1171,34,269,16,23,391,166,321,0.084,0.8740000000000001,0.042,-0.9227,0,0,12,0,0,0,43.0,0,2,0,2,9,3,0,0,25,0,20,14,0,3,4,40,39,18,0,3,10,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,0,2,13,7,8,2,8,6,0,3,6,3,0,5,7,0,25,0,37,28,9,45,1,1,0,0,9,13,0,5,28,160,38,3,0.08277434350784993,0.0,0.0,0.2707087571266362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769211998491592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06887488471293716,0.08968596660799996,0.0,0.05628939203852333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07738283746481618,0.0,0.0,0.06364836080223485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07043486970670762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08452185944792939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32029562287186986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4865240646960027,0.09599195935429868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2769458202623929,0.0,0.0,0.0697409544335254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780322843312815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07565425038250452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15880938554527044,0.0470425669510058,0.0,0.06620220408341197,0.0,0.0,0.16391922767303854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09344215849264252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136471843367455,0.0,0.09337306487348086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11693193349550887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0703717868118386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321393825493294,0.0879760274969482,0.0,0.0,0.0638406765896671,0.0,0.0,0.07767811409430965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05609003737776668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790174769904381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564970192943456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15840773563548285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05302736400932962,0.0,0.08172967824279506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535465354262005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06847179231615752,0.0,0.0,0.08437801918737672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822643670251776,0.0,0.13840611512462847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05499159578811213,0.05303845703832862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685950373736639,0.0,0.16171701204928804,0.0,0.0,0.21447136855697507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13279317098112967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469097029029946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205214158227758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05330396335560097

alcoholism,frackoffm8,2019/01/23,"Borrowing Money Question. Your experience and advice greatly appreciated One of my relatives borrowed a lot of money from me without giving me the full picture of his situation.  He was really convincing he would have the money back to me by the following week it was just a cash flow thing.   

I knew he was a binge drinker and would sometimes have these episodes but he insisted he didnt drink daily and binge drank every few months.  I then discovered shortly after that he is very dependant on alcohol and had lost his job before he borrowed the money with no way of paying it back in the timeframe he gave.

Now I knew there was a risk of me not getting the money back and I told them that I desperately needed it by then as it was the rent money that was due.  Just writing this makes me see how stupid I was to risk my rent money but he really seemed like he needed my help.  

I will take it as a lesson but my question is do you think he knew what he was doing when he did it?  I'm trying not to be angry but I'm struggling and just wandered if anyone had any similar experiences?",4.532852713178297,5.599674874418604,5.806511627906978,78.96201550387597,70.02325581395347,8.710077519379848,28.286821705426355,9.029198982220553,2.2769751937984495,858,30,164,16,15,288,120,215,0.109,0.825,0.066,-0.8613,5,0,3,0,0,0,9.0,0,2,1,2,10,8,1,3,12,0,22,3,0,3,0,35,41,17,0,5,11,0,0,1,0,3,1,0,2,0,13,7,3,0,8,1,14,2,5,5,0,1,19,1,21,3,18,18,3,18,0,1,1,0,25,4,0,6,12,116,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14819407818127728,0.0,0.1620715069830754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031296034915282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10603967704195162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3498366197272791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12904598756118962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14856272814496022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12777464309665856,0.0,0.0,0.2966925124241917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923271220799619,0.14547988856237984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671985565383614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10165016707187216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15049273189823467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409025636077415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655477468854332,0.12893041136291614,0.0,0.0,0.1012299115051645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210484039213048,0.0,0.0,0.22489834762362074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276435941314216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33977333107956065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19430627428842845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208482318904744,0.13805968157860665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704649261677721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14998922282447902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15854120117273446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402458399782665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10075186928849933,0.09717346103901492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14491145063652794,0.0,0.10296279473691908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12513004793256574,0.0,0.12037551634017275,0.1216473173159704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14618859493650765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21546063869836365,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,kingfridayxii,2019/01/23,"My brother is in recovery, I'm afraid he's going to die. He's at 200 some-odd-days. 

He spent a week in the hospital after he quit cold turkey back in the summer. I wasn't there because at the time he lived in a different state, but my mom was. She said it was ugly. Seizures, hallucinations, anger. All of it. I was afraid he would die there.  He's been home for awhile now. Living in my mom's basement.

It was simple at first, he went to meetings, he had a therapist, he got a job. He powered through, but now he's sick. Really sick. Back pain, migraines, numbness in his hands and legs, sleeplessness, hallucinations, vomiting,  dizzy spells...he's terrified he'll have another seizure so he sleeps on the floor next to my mom's bed. He doesn't go to meetings or his therapist. It's a fight to get him to take responsibility for his health.  I don't know how to help him. I'm afraid he's relapsed and I'm afraid it's going to kill him. 

I'm new to this so I apologize if I've said anything to offend anyone. I just need some advice.

alcoholism,bumblesyrup,2019/01/23,"Dealing with alcoholic mother It’s been about 6 years since it had gotten so bad, but i dont think ive really noticed it because i was so young whenever my moms issues started. I’ve been dealing with my alcoholic mom for some time now but only super recently has it gotten to the point that me (im 18 almost 19) can’t stand the thought of living at home anymore. The only issue is i don’t have a car or a job right now and my last job was a seasonal one during halloween. So moving out isn’t that much of an option. Recently my mom has become super emotionally abusive towards me, and i don’t mean to sound high and mighty but out of all my siblings I’m the only one who hasn’t become a drug addict or arrested or just anything stupid like that. Yet my mom really likes to target me and I’ve had a few complete mental breakdowns from her emotionally abusing me.  She always tells me to move out, pay bills, that i blame her for everything wrong (i dont i barely talk to my mom anymore even while living at home) that im selfish and don’t think about anyone but myself. I would love to get my mom help but she’s indenial, ive confronted her twice in the past and she’s gotten defensive and told me if i called anyone (cops or child services cause we had a child living with us at one point) that she would kick me out but i really had nowhere to go but maybe my boyfriends house. And in the past when my sister was a drug addict my parents were forced to go to AA meetings for a few months but that stopped eventually. 

I’m basically stuck in a loop and have been for a few years. Anytime ive ever tried to reach out to my mom when sober even she blames my problems on myself, which makes me upset because i know i have issues because of childhood trauma. When i was in highschool my counselor even reached out to my mom to get me into therapy but my mom lied and then never signed me up. Overall it’s getting to the point where whenever i am home (i try to spend the night at other peoples houses often, even if i have to leave early cause im atleast able to sleep without my mom slamming doors or yelling) the first night i am home my mom just complains and yells and tells me to move out cause i dont do anything. Im just not sure how much i can take anymore. 

 I usually talk to my boyfriend for help but most times he’s asleep and won’t see the messages til morning, he’s just about the only support system i have right now. 

I’m not sure how much advice would help, venting is nice for me though, sorry if this is so jumbled and not orderly or anything its 4am right now and I’ve just had an incident with my mom before writing this. If anyone could even just sympathize/empathize with my situation it would be nice.

alcoholism,Katelynw4,2019/01/24,"How do you stop thinking about it if it's always right in front of you? Im 21 and I've been an alcoholic since I was about 16 or 17. 
It's slowly destroying my life. My boyfriend tells me all the time that the only think he would change about me is my addiction to alcohol. I've lost 2 jobs because would come in drunk or to hungover to function.

But the problem is I'm 21 and all of my friends are around the same age as me and they all drink. (not exactly in moderation but WAY less than I do) I'm old enough to buy it on my own now and it honestly feels like it's everywhere all the time and I can't get away from it. If it's near me, it'll end up in my stomach. I drink 2 to 5 40s a day and it's been this way for almost 2 years, I know it's destroying my body and mind and I'm also worried that I couldn't function at all as a sober person.

I'm tempted to try rehab but I really need to help with bills and being gone for a month would hurt the people I live with financially.

Just like, how do you get it off of your mind? How do you get it out of your daily routine?",0.04983582897348171,1.6500206514522873,2.4508785856034656,96.15392206386437,83.149377593361,6.0170304889049255,19.606891574959405,7.079830092131019,0.09476604726682236,831,22,210,11,23,285,130,241,0.093,0.8370000000000001,0.07,-0.5337,1,0,4,0,0,0,17.0,0,6,1,1,10,9,2,0,10,0,17,10,2,3,6,47,32,22,0,8,9,0,1,2,1,4,5,0,0,1,16,14,5,1,4,3,2,3,3,5,0,0,5,1,26,4,34,21,9,28,0,2,0,0,12,13,0,5,12,134,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14700283840324305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2882202869340585,0.13502952021933007,0.0,0.0,0.1078368802193217,0.1122032806211906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12004217770602095,0.0,0.0,0.12669294049265598,0.0,0.0,0.08220131421092917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14978431656220045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14264995892210516,0.116158516626152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696498441731927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2641969148723865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194341769949909,0.13933271754557494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818255771949573,0.09633452992399393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10418224808867096,0.0,0.2113555504503677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038491979780704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14435621203532936,0.0,0.14565760680638282,0.0,0.13381457103909405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07410823554464438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09524623236944994,0.1317586005388982,0.0,0.11907213194506512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720113361316833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27231351100312456,0.0,0.10763337233222488,0.0,0.0,0.099987140691307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14149895810500449,0.0,0.0,0.10255701359953932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09348574289116013,0.11774296221645693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12903010791346475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08638626735041548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11515836951628175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11154660744488487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11273790322657687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11786198449036572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17280867775213046,0.0,0.0,0.1572604238224796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09155207721276497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21407011328044906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13694339860665355,0.0,0.2873737413717149,0.0,0.0,0.08683687215648772

I know I'm an alcoholic but today my mother (who has mental health issues) told me she hates me. She threw knifes at me, and punched me twice. I had her admitted. 

After that I went to the liquor store and started slamming vodka.

alcoholism,DailyRecovery,2019/01/24,"Living Sober- Reflecting on my Alcoholism vs my life in recovery  

Wet and wild day...133 Days Sober today working around the area of my last drunk and dui and even passed the liquor store where I bought my last drops of alcohol. As the day went on I reflected on life then vs life now and realized nothing is different other than my reality.... how I perceive the world around me. Before I used to always be drunk... and when I wasnt drinking I was wondering why I was not drunk. Now its like.... why? The stage was set for an identical scenario as last time but I did my job, got wet, held up in traffic... normal life. But now I am not as irritable. Now I am not preoccupied with the thoughts of how I was going to get drunk that day... now I am truly living and not just existing. The beginning is always the hardest, If you are new to sobriety.. it will get better I promise.

alcoholism,Repulsive_Sea,2019/01/24,"Spiraling I need to vent some of this and I'm not sure if this is the place or if anyone will see it. I was sober from drugs and alcohol for about 16 months. Before that I was homeless and miserable. I got my life back on track got into college and made pretty much straight As for a year then on Christmas I started drinking again.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't bad initially. I could just have a couple drinks and whatever I was fine, but now I can function. The obsession is back. I tell myself when I wake up in the morning I won't drink today, and by lunch I'm pouring a vodka soda. All I have to do is go to my classes and participate, but I cant even do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared. I can't tell anyone in my family because they think I'm doing great and could potentially withdraw support that I depend on. My friends are non-alcoholics and dont get it. My best friend said: just stop. Like, yeah... thanks. 

&amp;#x200B;

alcoholism,nirenannel593,2019/01/24,"21 Days My issues came to a breaking point January 2nd. I hurt two friends I love with my actions. I turn into an angry drunk, and black out. I said some things I didn't mean, and would have never said sober. I apologized to them, one of the two has spoken to me about it. It's really opened my eyes to my behavior and gave me the push I need to stop.

I haven't had a drink for 21 days. It's something I'm really proud of.

I haven't spoken openly about the alcohol abuse I deal with. Alcoholism runs in my family. It's something I've always had to be careful about. It got bad two years ago. My mother is 20+ years sober. I've been talking to her about it a lot. She's an inspiration and made me feel like I wasn't alone.

I know that I'm not a bad person. I become someone different when I drink too much. I hope that those I love can see that I'm trying. I really want to go back to who I used to be. I feel like I've lost myself. The depression and anxiety doesn't help. I started Zoloft around the same time I stopped drinking. I'm hoping that I can find new ways of coping.

alcoholism,captain_hot_dog,2019/01/24,"8 Months Tomorrow... I started drinking in college where it was a lot more socially acceptable to abuse alcohol.  After college, I joined the military and graduated to drinking by myself all the time.  I would quit during deployments and stay sober for anywhere from 3-6 months (we had short deployments) out of the year.  Towards the end of my time in the military, I didn't deploy nearly as much, so I ended up drinking a lot more.  I didn't consider myself an ""alcoholic"" because I wouldn't get up and drink in the mornings, I didn't drink every day, and I never had any withdrawal symptoms when I would stop drinking for weeks or days at a time (or when I deployed for months).

Anyway, in my heavier drinking days I would put away 10+ drinks a night.  I think the most I ever got to was 14 in one night, which might have just been the highest I could count when I was that drunk.  I wouldn't do this every night.  Maybe once or twice a week.  It was not uncommon to buy a handle of whiskey Friday night and have it be gone by Monday morning.  I didn't have friends or anything else to do, so I'd basically go home and drink and play video games until I was too drunk to function and then go to bed.

I began noticing my left arm felt like it was asleep when I woke up in the mornings after a heavy night.  I figured I had just slept on it wrong, but then it started to stay like that for longer during the day.  One day I had the sudden realization that it was alcoholic neuropathy and I was doing permanent damage to my central nervous system.  I stopped binge drinking, but I still didn't quit drinking though.  I had to ""make sure"" it was alcohol and not something else.  It took me months of being ""throttled back"" to see if I could get those symptoms to go away before I said enough was enough and quit once and for all.

Tomorrow that will have been 8 months ago.  I can still feel some nerve damage in my arm sometimes, just a mild barely noticeable sensation.  I've been taking multivitamins that are supposed to help with brain and nerve function (niacin, folate, B's), but they aren't helping at all.  I can't be an alcoholic and do my job, so I'm afraid I'll lose my job if I go to a doctor for help. I haven't told my family either.  They know I don't drink and they don't try and make me or ask why.

I've really had no problem being sober.  I'm not tempted to drink again, even when other people are drinking around me.  It's kind of great, actually.  I've lost a lot of weight, saved who knows how much money, and have so much more free time now!  Now I'm just worried about all the damage I did to my body.  I'm worried this nerve damage will never go away, or that my liver will quit on me, or that I'll wake up with stomach cancer one day, or who knows what else.

I don't really know why I'm posting this.  Does anybody know anything about alcoholic neuropathy or how I can recover from that?

alcoholism,tomtoff,2019/01/25,"How to deal with a very angry alcoholic brother Hello Reddit, any insights here would be very welcome. Recently at my sister's wedding the extent of my brother's relationship with alcohol came into full view for me and my family. I've known for a long time he drinks alot. He's the type to have beer with breakfast and to hell with anyone who says anything. But this time he really got into it and was actually scary. My brother is a big guy, over six feet and likely 250+. So when he got really mad and was towering over people screaming at them he got alot of people very scared. I feel like he is spiralling ballot out of control, his moods swing like crazy and he's irritable whenever he's not drinking anymore. I really have no idea what to do, I'm afraid he's going to end up hurt or in jail and can't reach him. Thanks for your time.

alcoholism,Creatura,2019/01/25,"Dating an alcoholic I’ve been seeing someone I’ve loved more than anyone in my life before, for about 6 months now. We immediately became friends on a road trip with mutual friends, and while I initially had no intention of getting physical/romantic, we ended up spending pretty much every day together, fucking, falling very very hard in love, and entering a real relationship eventually about two months after the road trip.

Things were amazing then, just complete love and understanding from the sweetest and kindest person I have ever met. However it was summer and we were drinking a lot, like every night, getting pretty hammered. Eventually I phased out of drinking since summer as I chose to go back to community college to escape the wage slave life, but she works in homeless/mental health care so she can do whatever she wants when work is over. I work and school so I’m very busy. 

Some background on her: her mother died when she was 14 and has a LOT of guilt and unresolved feelings about. Since we got together she went from fairly frequently (at least once/month, sometimes once/week or more) getting blackout drunk to just drinking to a solid buzz every other/every few days. Also, she is 28 and I’m 24. She very much wants to get better, but her past’s problems that alcohol seemingly answers are too difficult to face right now. 

However, the drinking kept getting to me more and more. Being with her sober is amazing and she absolutely feels something like a soulmate. But calling her after work/school in the evening and not knowing whether or not she will be sober has been horribly hard. We had talks of going to AA, but I kind of knew she was just humoring me, and she didn’t really want to face the problem that drinking was the answer to. On the positive side, I am 100%, seriously 100%, sure she would never cheat on me, even while drunk. 

Fast forward to today: I broke up with her 2 days ago. It was absolutely horrible and I feel horrid because I feel like I lost my best friend and best lover I’ve ever connected with. But, at the time, the drinking was so so much for me, partially because our relationship was way too do-dependent and I felt like I had to stick around when she was drunk with her friends and I showed up, not knowing how drunk she would really be. Anyway - I’m really not sure I want to actually be without her and am seeking ways to make this work. Have any of you had experience on either end of this situation? Can Al-Anon really help significantly? I feel like I thought drinking was the only problem in our relationship so I broke it off, but after talking extensively to many many mutual friends, the co-dependency, my possessiveness/need for her to change, and our inability to address the differences in our daily lives were just as large obstacles, but ones I can face. I feel like now I can love her for who she is, drunk nights and not, but I really don’t want to do that and then reneg again a month/year down the line.

alcoholism,Protactium91,2019/01/26,"When did you realize you were an alcoholic? I have never drunk more than a beer or wine with food or in social occasions. I got drunk once in my teens (long ago) and maybe a couple of times latest in my life.

I had a bout of paralyZing anxiety that lasted a couple of years that I'm coming out of, but I'm still very sensitive to things, events but mostly about how people react to me. When.my 'demons' engulf me, it's very hard to get rid of them easily, even if I understand the situation that brought them up and I'm at peace with it.

I've noticed that a shot of something in the 40% alcohol range helps to subside those emotions. These situations are far from being more than sporadic (once a week at most) and I do have a purpose and motivation to do things and keep going (that is, I'm not depressed)

What are my risks of getting hooked up on alcohol if I use it only in those occasions and how fast so you think I will need to up the dose for it to be effective?

I'm looking more for personal experiences on how it was for you in the beginning and how it changed so I can weigh my risk than for cautionary takes on why not to do it.

alcoholism,ApprehensiveMention7,2019/01/26,"Doctor won't give me meds to safe withdrawal So I am a cardiac patient and that is the driving force behind my drinking. At 47 (and a female) I had a blood clot go to my heart. Two stents and now Atrial Fibrillation later, I self-medicated quitting smoking cold turkey and the intense anxiety that I could drop dead with alcohol. 

Now almost 4 years later, I want off the alcohol. I went to the dr about a week or so ago after having 5 days of cold turkey. I was uncomfortable, but my vitals were stable, I wasn't shaky, etc. I couldn't sleep or shit, ate anything and everything, irritated one minute, crying the next and of course, anxiety, but I thought I was pass the dangerous period. She (the doc) says ""Oh we don't do cold turkey here"" and proceeds to give me a drug called Hydroxine, an antihistimine that treats anxiety and I guess alcohol withdrawal symptoms. 

I look it up in my drug book (I'm a nurse) and its to be used in caution with people with cardiac issues. WTF. So I go back a week later...now having drank again.....because she said the other alternative was to 'taper.' Yeah k except my taper was a 16 beer binge. 

I go back and see someone else in the physician's group, and I asked for Ativan. Typically that's prescribed for the withdrawal and any potential seizures/DT's. (I know, I used to detox folks at the jail.) He wouldn't prescribe it. Refused. Basically told me I'd have to go either to A)inpatient rehab or ICU detox, even as he sat there looking at me saying ""You don't seem to be in real withdrawal."" 

SO after that, feeling discouraged and scared shitless, I just said ""fuck it"" and decided to taper myself. I can't afford to go thru the ER (plus I know everyone there, nursing world is small and I don't need my employers knowing) and there is a waiting list for a local rehab. I'm in a small town, not a lot of resources, hardly any A.A......I left a message for the health dept counseling but WTF, do I potentially die trying to quit or do I die from NOT quitting?

TV and media makes it seem like help is just a phone call away and its just so easy to get help and I'm telling you right now that's total bullshit. 

Anyone taper before cold turkey? I don't have a baseline. For example my neighbor, she's been drinking 12 beers a day for 20 years, from 3pm til 9 or 10pm. Me, it varies. Most I really drank was 3 days in a row, I can marathon (12 beers in 12 hours) or I can binge (go out and get wasted in a few hours.) I stopped wine, never really drank hard liquor and now drink an average of 6-8 beers in a 'normal' night out of drinking, up to 16 beers if 'out on the town.' Thanks in advance.

alcoholism,Mybassy85,2019/01/26,"Going to detox in a facility for two weeks on Monday. Terrified. My first ever post on reddit. Lurked for a while. I'm 33 F, always drank heavily. I'm probably what they'd call a functioning alcoholic. I work full time, I socialise, I'm a good actress pretending to be a normal person, but over the last couple of years it's escalated badly. I realised that it was bad, and finally spoke openly about it to my family and friends after years of playing it down 'I've had a bad week in work' etc.  They seem releaved now I've admitted I have a problem. They knew for years, I was just very defensive. So I sought help, was referred to a service in my area, turned out that my liver isn't doing great (not a surprise) and I need a hospital detox. I got a place, on Monday in a great facility, and I feel so lucky for that. Its far from my home, but it offers a lot of additional therapy etc. I cried when I found out I had a place because alcoholism is exhausting. And I'm ready. If anyone has any advice it would be appreciated.

alcoholism,DamachKH,2019/01/26,"I feel like I can't stop. I've been killing an 18-pack of Rolling Rock just about everyday for 3 years now. When I snag that last one up, it's the ultimate depression..

I know it's a problem, so does my new fiance. And last night, I really hammered in the nail. 

I have this dream where I wake up, have to pee, run down the hallway to the bathroom, start to pee, and I wake up peeing off the edge of our bed.

alcoholism,christycaa,2019/01/26,"What should I tell my visiting alcoholic dad after my baby is born? Hello Reddit,

I don't really know what to do about my current situation and thought I'd write to you all to see what kind of advice I can get. My dad is an alcoholic and about a year-and-a-half ago he almost died falling because he was drunk. He lost his memory for about a month and was the most stubborn and cruel person during that time. Much of that time he was in the hospital and only remembers hallucinations like the room being full of fire and dogs trying to attack him. Once he was sober and the effects of not drinking and hallucinations stopped, he made the decision to stop drinking. Unfortunately, his wife is an enabler and now he drinks about one to three beers a day. At least this is what he tells me. We currently live on opposite coasts so I only really know what he just tells me. 

I'm due for my second child in one month and they (my dad and his wife) are coming to visit for one week about one and a half weeks after my due date. I remember after my first child that I was very emotional for the first few weeks but felt normal again after my hormones balanced out. I'm really nervous that his drinking will cause a lot of anxiety that I don't really want to deal with. I think that I just need to be honest with him and tell him that I don't want him drinking in my house but I also feel like I shouldn't tell him what to do. Maybe if he really feels the need to drink he should just stay at a hotel and do that on his own time. 

Am I giving him too much credit? Do I need to be more stern? Even if I am stern I feel like it won't get me anywhere because he is stubborn. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",4.232571640316209,4.749684653409093,5.430400197628463,83.38801877470358,70.36363636363636,8.621739130434783,25.24752964426877,8.716276077567194,1.5260176383399209,1346,35,286,22,23,449,165,352,0.092,0.826,0.08199999999999999,0.7653,2,0,9,0,0,0,27.0,1,2,1,5,14,14,4,1,15,0,31,10,0,3,1,60,54,20,1,12,8,5,5,3,0,6,2,0,1,3,16,19,10,4,12,9,1,4,6,6,0,9,9,6,44,8,40,35,10,41,0,1,1,0,46,10,0,5,29,193,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15764527353008906,0.07150259838971461,0.17240774640486678,0.08077202172958531,0.0,0.0,0.06450591558184947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054853388040189584,0.0,0.061706728965470525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09176544267178488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834244136927857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08286279131210654,0.0,0.06948375595028458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05202075516271586,0.0831596805857242,0.0,0.0,0.08371512623326115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4741123033163291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907346574368336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05327693900270161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12235642305665455,0.11525086857586744,0.07744882183126901,0.0,0.0,0.13722326779982366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08428584152520098,0.07737899215341497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08893088881420666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307390206092177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08399776789836648,0.08866019818526083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11822313219177236,0.0,0.07122662372815003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805284313763233,0.06857652550998387,0.0,0.0763249776000871,0.0,0.0,0.08103650326872121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12876836227701366,0.0,0.11859270106693676,0.17943106412906915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790322995136975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859031210269756,0.21863647654007146,0.12269520498225855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07043154035655053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583728895811722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182750183044692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06427771205775606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09066823129103943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08597568374045257,0.0,0.1348752236455237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3525136857808758,0.07426335782830934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051685387949922605,0.0,0.06403715734311019,0.14110517110881435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05476466448230422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06655515819273361,0.09515387642839213,0.0,0.1941082077755437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05730045312779322,0.0,0.0,0.051944120910450864
alcoholism,booze-drugs,2019/01/26,"Need insights on my though 42m
So this will be a bit of a long message. 
 
I Moved in my early 20s into a small ski town in the early 2000’s And was living the party life, drinking 4-5 times a week at least, smoking weed every day numerous times a day and doing coke on occasion (1-2 times a month) This lasted throughout my 20’s. Once I hit my 30’s I was pretty much done with the hard drugs and getting drunk 3,4,5 times a week, I was just sick and tired of the hungovers and didn’t enjoy it anymore. I did keep smoking weed daily 2-3 grams a day minimum. 

A bit of a background, I had a rough childhood. Lost my dad when I was 3, my mom did the best she could but left me with various member of my family (uncles and aunts) throughout my youth in order to go work outside and provide. But that just made the child feel abandoned and worthless of being loved (thats what I gathered through therapy) and obviously low self esteem/confidence 

Now I somehow delt with it as a young adult and could function somewhat normaly ( social life, girlfriends bla bla bla) 

In my early 30’s I got held at gun point in a home invasion, tied up with zap straps, gun shots were fired. Pretty dramatic event. (was gang related) The first 6 months after the event I was in hell, extreme violent thought, just wanted to kill everyone for any reason. I wanted to find these guys and fucking torture them and burry them which at some point I convinced myself that I was better to let it go otherwise I would end up dead or in jail. From that point on I started to use more for the emotional numbing effect, it took years before I realized the pattern I was in. Until I finally realized that all I did was to put the lid on it to be able to function but all my dysfunctionality  from my youth just exploded in behavioural fucked up pattern. Finally about a year and a half ago I figured put I had PTSD from that home invasion event (duh) 
So I started to look for therapist who I could work and do EMDR therapy.  At that point of my life I would smoke a lot (sometimes I would stop for 5-6 months but go right back into it) the drinking wasn’t severe but I would get drunk occasionally and started to use hard drugs again, coke, ketamine, MDMA. My last stretch was a bit out of hand but nothing too extreme. It took me a couple therapist before I found the right on. She pointed out that I had addict behaviour and if I wanted the EMDR therapy to work I should stop using everything. Which I did, went to AA (altho stopping smoking weed was the hardest, I quite booze and hard drugs in a blink of an eye) after months of EMDR working on the home invasion and the past from my youth I am finally feeling myself again, I have seriously not felt that good for a long long time. 

Now here is the reason why I am writing this: 
I am considering drinking again, not getting drunk but enjoying a beer or a gin now and then. Drinking like a gentleman like they say. 
 The reason why I think I could is because, alcohol has never be a big issue for me, drugs were and I have no intention to even take a toke of a joint. On top of that I hate being hung over and I truly feel the last years of using were me trying numb the pain of my traumas. Most of the people around me know I am dry and have a bit of an idea what was going on. So I am also thinking asking good friends around me to keep an eye on me if I do start to enjoy the occasional drink. There is also the part of me that wants to know If I can handle my shit this time. If things get out of hands well thats it, im done forever. 

I am just looking for insights or if some of you have had similar experience

alcoholism,drbb1234,2019/01/26,"Starting Today I don't drink often, but when I do I can't stop and I get completely plastered and have a blackout every time.  It's always scared me, but now I've started drinking more frequently and have had incidents like this once every two weeks or so.  When I wake up, I feel so ashamed and scared about what happened during the blackout.  I had been struggling for a while wondering if it could be alcoholism because I don't do it often, but finally realized today that I am not in control of this behavior and I am putting my life in danger.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember very little about last night, but I remember getting into a car with complete strangers and some neighbors trying to help me get inside my apartment.  I can't keep doing this.  I have a problem and I need to stop drinking completely and permanently, but I'm not sure where to start.

alcoholism,GloomyJuggernaut,2019/01/26,"I want to quit so bad. 42M
Averaging 10-12 Bud Light 16oz every night for 15 years. Family thinks I have 1-2 and have never asked me to stop. I’m filled with guilt all day yet I always stop at 1 of multiple stores on my way home to refill. My sneaky trick is to load up my work back pack that easily conceals a 6 pack. I’ll Pound these and some that are always in the garage fridge.  All under the nose of wife and kids.  I’ve tried to stop recently and went 5 days.  I tossed and turned and felt no better so my mind thinks I need the beers to pass out. 
I question if I’m an alcoholic but Duh look what I’m doing to myself.  I get physicals annually just to see if the Dr. says anything about my blood work. All normal. No meds and I’m ok shape. 

Do I have to really fuckup to see where this if going? Do I tell my wife and hope she gives me an ultimatum to stop? This sucks I want today to be day 1 but I’m not sure if I can. I dream to win the lottery so I could afford a 30 day program to reset my mind and stop this horse shit behavior.

alcoholism,throwawaysilentcurt,2019/01/26,"Are these symptoms of alcoholism? I'm a college student so everyone drinks a lot and it's hard for me to tell. 

I drink alone at least 5-6 nights a week, varying amounts, but always enough that I'd call myself ""drunk"" and feel bad in the morning. I drink as much as possible if there's a social situation with alcohol but it's almost always just me at home. I start to feel anxious around 6pm if I haven't had a drink yet. If I drink a lot, then the next day I feel myself really craving more and feeling kind of shakey or cold-sweaty.

Lately I've found that I get really agitated and upset until I have a drink, all the time. I'm a really sensitive and calm person, I NEVER get angry, but nowadays I find myself snapping at people if I haven't had something to drink recently.

I started drinking all the time because I'm lonely and depressed and it sort of just makes me feel better, or at least speeds up time. But drinking for unhealthy reasons isn't the same thing as alcoholism.

Am I just being melodramatic about having an unhealthy but normal relationship with alcohol? Any advice?",3.8211573187414514,5.488533227906977,5.1488645690834485,80.67358413132695,72.53488372093022,7.84952120383037,27.53077975376197,8.4952907291091,2.071309165526676,864,32,161,15,17,288,122,215,0.166,0.774,0.06,-0.9742,0,3,14,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,1,8,7,0,1,14,0,10,15,0,2,3,42,24,24,0,5,14,0,6,0,0,0,5,0,1,1,7,10,14,0,8,10,0,0,4,4,0,0,3,6,19,3,22,20,11,23,0,2,0,0,5,7,0,10,16,108,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07931799726621132,0.0,0.3469824842012732,0.08127963313166882,0.08406722991094191,0.0,0.0,0.13507922519826168,0.0,0.0,0.05519811390709098,0.0,0.0,0.0916985481166806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07225815620483278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777322859209835,0.04948023699671638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07178791825156478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08288324063356382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052347679361221054,0.0,0.06991126068574771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7156377898854822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08386989857438269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756103473561736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052089523986217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07418754722579192,0.0,0.0,0.08899828081058801,0.0,0.0,0.08481553551176024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07271202153646035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08141973062705178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08452565148753206,0.0,0.0,0.09156284841757197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13801498874342052,0.0,0.0,0.054181340729442674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059668998177890335,0.0,0.06260300228310382,0.0,0.0863247943320714,0.0761721744468533,0.07952897763945174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056272782965478205,0.07087416705061772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150653215961167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15599797969624007,0.0834558713317772,0.0801451912315599,0.0871457774451635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123803537696612,0.0,0.08274218899312369,0.0,0.06248832647869314,0.0,0.0,0.11490452648387835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436629747969596,0.0,0.0,0.0709458112862048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053925477933169534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419919459129362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06510935997393387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,kutuup1989,2019/01/26,"Feeling like this is my last chance. Terrified. Hi all,

So as you will see from my post history, I tend to purport that I'm a recovering alcoholic who hasn't drunk in some time.

The thing is, it's all been a lie, and I've been in denial that after quitting for a couple of months last year, it came back, and even worse. All because I'm too damned ashamed and scared to ask for help again.

Without going into too much detail on amounts, we're talking over 700ml whiskey a day here. Sometimes less, but usually about that amount, sometimes a bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified, because I feel anxious, shaky, sweaty, dizzy and just generally awful every day now. I have frequent panic attacks, no appetite, and just feel like death. It's scaring the hell out of me. 

I'm even more terrified to try quitting because I've read so many horror stories about seizures and getting dangerously ill if you quit alcohol from the level I drink at. I want to talk to my parents but I know they'll be so damned disappointed and worried. I just don't know what to do. I feel like, at 30 and already drinking like I am, this might be my last chance before I do so much damage that there's no going back to normal. I've been drinking excessively since about age 18, but the last 4 years or so have been the most intense, and it's worse than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

Are the horror stories about what happens when you try to quit true? Is it really dangerous to try quitting? Should I taper or just go cold turkey? How long will I feel like s\*\*t for? Will Diazepam help? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for some reassurance, even though I may not deserve it.",4.560024610336342,5.874481056603777,4.8675827180749245,84.79020098441345,70.19496855345912,7.417227235438883,29.86382280557834,7.7425588080867325,1.8485141919606232,1288,51,251,15,23,406,174,318,0.278,0.625,0.097,-0.9977,1,0,6,0,0,0,57.0,0,3,1,5,29,20,6,5,11,1,24,8,0,1,5,48,47,24,1,4,13,1,5,5,0,7,3,0,0,0,16,12,7,0,7,6,0,4,6,13,0,0,5,8,22,7,33,33,14,35,1,2,2,0,13,9,3,9,26,159,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16016645684932446,0.0,0.0,0.08269315487045077,0.0,0.0,0.24357765230437045,0.2731643955508177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465575191142248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07005454919056536,0.08524991550805802,0.0,0.11524150234853645,0.0,0.13703990151673207,0.0,0.06376456597166125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08181012545677617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08570621499223481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291467259743064,0.0,0.09665435818031436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2202246980032014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14848251421026787,0.06778342302781609,0.06313636567257902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18944812672667072,0.21413565983578986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039150690387059164,0.0,0.12776266398934105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0662651889128181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045533234749153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236514949592355,0.2443296392113607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18304842827188814,0.0,0.0,0.06631553313849127,0.06292692207602438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597280530247089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07949469203978421,0.0,0.0,0.05981277747163132,0.0,0.11017238572028673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07342085059239653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879206286542753,0.08320697175905313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176746647530077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3985154832954391,0.07495574890782909,0.0,0.048005581109979545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500469567482637,0.0,0.05971386790530703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061987395398358014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14822619245398447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12046058505252795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049783796748957054,0.0,0.07362371910682937,0.0,0.04369547535013095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15262879633159754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825308337378261,0.0,0.04419888189717617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223511929585076,0.0,0.0,0.07610060754935892,0.15273129231493676,0.0,0.0,0.2731643955508177,0.09651197204147163

alcoholism,frozen__solid,2019/01/26,"For the past several months, I've averaged ~40 beers a week I can't go on like this.  Either my pancreas or my liver will quit on me.  Trouble is drinking is the only thing in my life that I have to look forward to.  I'm 38 with no friends, virtually no family, divorced, no children.  I go to work and that's it.  In my free time I sit on the couch and mindlessly browse the internet.  I have no hobbies or anything that brings me real joy.  

On the plus side I have a decent paying job and am a homeowner.  That's about it though.

Part of me wants to not care if my health deteriorates, I've got nothing going on in my life.  But then I think about how awful it would be to go through that alone.  But then again, I'm going to end up dying alone either way, so might as well have fun doing it.

There is just so much wrong with my life that I don't even know where to begin to fix things.",1.9306060606060635,3.207161133689844,3.659165775401071,91.03267023172907,76.70053475935828,6.697896613190732,22.09233511586453,7.3011,0.5402822816399295,680,18,157,8,15,228,114,187,0.13699999999999998,0.782,0.08199999999999999,-0.7752,1,2,2,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,0,2,12,9,0,0,8,1,15,7,1,1,0,22,30,16,1,3,9,0,0,1,1,3,4,0,1,1,13,6,2,0,2,2,2,7,7,2,1,0,1,1,18,8,26,25,4,29,0,0,1,0,3,12,0,4,11,109,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3086286274811018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12261053009455786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1519107541068969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15463371589114314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459587821027581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13196571219655934,0.0,0.0,0.09841006542041493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14045961561395576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511348688605867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42338763551890624,0.0,0.1191652431815972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1583751572315802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14785495754863995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08188398270362372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157196006600506,0.07279163299658735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251186219025919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15806058819422766,0.0,0.0,0.11892671757210015,0.0,0.10952877256883273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14296511770048026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331772597204773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613475133445601,0.1422329813868113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584749624859481,0.0,0.16958939983243426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16832240741869248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19797186440432912,0.09547024481217822,0.1463872372918703,0.0,0.08688042381259373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878813552318509,0.11826562408613325,0.1195151334605397,0.0,0.13396477038384644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084704355690032,0.0,0.0,0.10584206687699543,0.1629030949917046,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,RedditToComment,2019/01/27,"Advice Hello, I’m hoping this isn’t very long but I have no one else i can really talk to about my drinking habits. As others often mention when I get to drinking I can not stop, sometimes I can be fine but the other times I can get out of hand, etc, say and do things to people I do care about or, and i know this bad but i’ll take sleepy medicine. I’m seriously scared at this point. I go on random streaks where I won’t drink at all however this past week I was drinking everyday at all times of the day. Yesterday I pretty much had 3 too many and now I’m in a bind with someone I love. I really, really hope someone can reach out to me and offer any advice. At the moment I’m going to get rid of all the alcohol at home, which is not the hard part, it’s when I want to drink.. on a side note I’m limited on time and money, I really wish I could seek professional but I feel that is out of the picture. Any tips on what I can do to get rid of that feeling that always takes over would be so very much appreciated. Thank you in advance.

alcoholism,ThisBirdHasFlown_,2019/01/27,"118 days sober. I don't want to drink, but I have a nagging feeling it won't last. I think I'm doing really well with my sobriety so far. I've gone to restaurants and social gatherings where there is alcohol and haven't had any difficulty turning drinks down. I'm even thinking of telling my psychiatrist to take me off a few of the medications I'm taking (specifically acamprosate and gabapentin) and just leave me with my antibuse prescription. It's a lot of pills to take every day, and I don't think I need to take as many as I was in the beginning.

Lately, though, a there's a nagging voice in the back of my mind telling me that it won't last and that I'll eventually relapse. It keeps telling me that most addicts who manage to quit for a few months usually end up relapsing several times before they are successful at staying sober for good. I also imagine myself after relapsing thinking about how I knew it would happen. Or I picture myself with a glass of wine debating whether or not to break my streak and failing. 

This isn't my first time trying to stay sober, but it is the most successful attempt so far. My past attempts have only last days. Still, the voice keeps telling me not to expect this to be the last time I have to try. In fact, as I was writing that last sentence, I pictured my future self telling you all on this sub about how I relapsed and linking to this very post for context.

I really don't want to relapse, and I hate that there's this pessimistic voice telling me that I'm going to inevitably fail again. It keeps telling me that I'm eventually going to get comfortable and convince myself that I can just one drink. 

Does this happen to anyone else?",7.44411586991292,6.572053507552872,7.2258859072329855,77.93579704993783,63.77341389728097,10.325999644570821,36.08690243468989,9.478462496947786,3.1749234405544686,1345,55,262,21,17,427,164,331,0.087,0.8220000000000001,0.091,0.2817,0,0,5,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,1,8,19,11,3,0,13,0,20,8,0,2,2,47,50,24,0,5,9,0,1,0,0,3,4,3,0,1,22,13,5,3,8,4,0,3,9,5,1,2,5,4,36,6,41,41,6,41,0,2,0,0,14,11,0,5,23,174,58,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232512562360093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09050836870735623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772694746067189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05759243158286556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0592175538191557,0.08677540655860204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06512175264489525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07206536201093469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638550629034596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741132110829618,0.0,0.0,0.2488932896117069,0.0,0.0,0.07074803005110426,0.0,0.0750106291455843,0.0,0.0,0.05593726429823258,0.0,0.07135538333737394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04282205211251207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203768030288532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04424728111495892,0.0,0.0962631046629172,0.071034357772615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497830261982037,0.0,0.0,0.08361431696035114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22583037375915185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34517022956749066,0.09553455199388378,0.0896749915722288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07200081881415782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08586285554804952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531675022442348,0.0,0.0,0.08551324377629388,0.0,0.06759913434192064,0.0,0.0,0.06279691892579077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05738846207378835,0.06441092748281198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084664752300004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08111007066916644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09007875183659844,0.0,0.0,0.10850978214996336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835064251605139,0.09567613791201653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08633128056918687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18053756971161886,0.06763392792800083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547068089212229,0.0,0.5181624960280972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170649635832044,0.0832079680803134,0.0,0.1481511024828366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499855542358922,0.0921189243920452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09327460039520988,0.06987851674528138,0.09990528049117887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614691378976288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06016168817159943,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,DailyWhey,2019/01/28,"Alcohol got the better of me. I messed up bad, did stuff I don't remember and deeply regret. Now I am left depressed.  

I have been having these depressing thoughts because I let my best friend down and they have been going around in my head for months and I need help on how to get over it. I am making this post because I need some sort of help or form of inspiration that I can get over this.

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for years but through this time I have had one amazing, special friend (who I initially knew via online but have met up with her several times).

I have never had many close friends but this friend at times has been the one person who can make me laugh just by being silly despite how shit my day has been. At one point a few years ago I was going through hard times and I would Skype her most days, it was a time of the day where I could forget about my issues and just chill out and be silly. I don't know if she knows this but her being there for me was a factor which helped get me through times when I was really suicidal. She has been there for me and her kindness continues to warm my heart. For example, one year she sent me a gift for my birthday which meant so much to me.

Aside from being a great friend. I feel appreciative to even know her as she is an amazingly sweet and funny person in general. So much so that despite things between me and her being completely platonic, I legit get jealous that some of our mutual friends are also lucky enough to know her. I really can't emphasise how lucky we are.

All this is great but all of this contributes to me feeling like shit right now because in return I have been a fucking awful friend in the last year which makes me feel guilty.

A few months ago she bought me a plane ticket (it was expensive) for me to come and visit her which made me so so happy. It was literally the nicest thing that anyone had ever done for me and for a few weeks it even made me not depressed at all; the excitement of hanging out with in real life again and just seeing her made me ecstatic (the last time I can recall feeling like this was when I believed in Santa and I was looking forward to Christmas).

I had a lot invested in this meet up going well.

When we meet up I felt a little anxious hanging out with some of her friends so I drank a fair bit and got too drunk. Usually I never black out on booze and I become more energetic and probably come across as silly and perhaps a bit annoying. This time I experimented with tequila which I never drank before; I blacked the fuck out and did shit I don't even remember. I have no recollection of this but I pulled her arm, pushed one of her friends, cursed at her friends and was just a complete ass hole in general.

Naturally she was initially upset by this but since has accepted me apologising numerous times and told me to not feel bad.

In the past I have had to live with letting myself down when drunk but given the fact that I was a complete brat and the context of this situation I just can't forgive myself. Meeting up with her is so rare and each occasion I meet up with her it means a lot to me. The fact that I fucked up this bad is something I can't get my head around.

I feel like it must be impossible for her to like me now and this makes me sick. She is the one person I never wanted to let down. Thinking about how bad I have been makes me feel guilty to the point that I am super depressed.

I know this has been a long story and bit of a ramble. I know there are good people on this sub. Can someone give me any sort of advice on how to get over this level of guilt?

Also, can anyone else relate to doing/saying crazy shit they don't mean when drunk?  I appreciate any comment.",5.471757375075256,5.347913969536425,5.91846929560506,83.19229756170984,67.58278145695364,9.141782059000603,28.68226971703793,8.776555601660561,1.9183046357615896,2937,87,617,43,44,948,291,755,0.127,0.6609999999999999,0.211,0.9976,0,0,3,0,0,0,52.0,3,0,2,3,43,61,9,3,33,1,79,21,9,13,11,133,136,56,1,8,17,0,10,4,10,2,3,0,0,3,43,46,7,0,26,5,3,12,14,23,1,6,44,15,109,38,97,80,22,101,0,6,4,4,57,47,8,12,47,466,152,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049093365714287365,0.08906840360419885,0.053690645819550915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08035286903264494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06832903719655774,0.0,0.03843300778130906,0.05675622826244879,0.0,0.07025712105550455,0.05147620806700902,0.0,0.08944744473307857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16779122073609096,0.09187642606594923,0.05548547638799374,0.042750033868109424,0.05660260609032646,0.052723156663998634,0.044432671601162016,0.16454525710654716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655359886621737,0.15802518281612565,0.0,0.0,0.04011207736294542,0.0,0.0,0.09720078125079336,0.0,0.2163556321822542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05141235468937888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04196857680847863,0.0,0.0,0.051910735836069234,0.0,0.09954796076134284,0.04544441863563165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049143778873924654,0.0,0.0,0.1778178710160157,0.10767312422096316,0.04823770797768268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38814840151020813,0.1393365628218225,0.15748809526129112,0.04819421572655668,0.0856566359292968,0.04213842983426521,0.08036208424872927,0.11077824409417952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05348078147113117,0.045004639402755495,0.0,0.1031202484520326,0.0,0.0,0.05953393754264282,0.10102324374001148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05243688685079432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05231660989609376,0.16566158069989098,0.08190364187463238,0.0,0.0,0.05458526119514431,0.15411958818413093,0.03548557793896562,0.09817774356504157,0.05035308278789682,0.044362315583316214,0.044460293024062666,0.0421884475958245,0.0,0.0,0.08542349214508399,0.0,0.14261322098213178,0.16767596680445007,0.05093487190329727,0.0,0.10945088179418228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020122849403014,0.0,0.07386348748873899,0.07450376535909553,0.15499090707405025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042611286893342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04795919736317896,0.034829678119744835,0.13160133346661093,0.0,0.0,0.0949849542272146,0.0,0.04811546312118,0.0,0.05416657645946778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05718344239123822,0.06436929937614481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138229059414662,0.042904177888562274,0.0,0.03995239180415875,0.0,0.0,0.040034301754397726,0.0,0.0,0.05675622826244879,0.20628011160117693,0.04155855548132192,0.05647119685562929,0.0,0.0,0.04256768534138209,0.038676748914827995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05252113488930756,0.0575120997524024,0.054953755553222204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06675365744814597,0.03219138253740373,0.0,0.0398844762592724,0.26365501283867915,0.0,0.0,0.04800590502398205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05533160751103368,0.0,0.02963250308763331,0.0,0.04029902078711674,0.0,0.04517125915457745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03568863230726947,0.0,0.0,0.12941012020013132

alcoholism,sudsypowersofhell,2019/01/28,"Will I finally learn this time? I've had intermittent problems stemming from alcohol for all of my adult life. Legal issues, relationships failing, work impacted, kinda the whole nine yards. 

Sometimes I can have a few drinks socially and have a great time like everyone around me. Sometimes, when I'm hurting I can get to the level of being numb without going over the edge. 

Other times I lose all semblance of control and blackout. Over and over. Recently we had a white board on the fridge keeping track of days since last blackout incident. It started as a joke but the reality was anything but funny. 

I'd been going hard daily and it was only fueling my self-destructive tailspin. The numbness that I sought was nowhere to be found, instead I sank into misery. Where did my sometimes go?!? 

Sometimes is a double edged sword. And if I keep cutting myself on it I'm going to bleed out. 

So, I've been sober for 8 days. I'm doing alright for the most part. The time I would have spent drinking I'm trying to use to exercise. 

Hopefully I'll learn to care for myself more if I treat myself like I matter. Hopefully I'll be able to finally deal with all the emotional baggage I've struggled so long to ignore. Hopefully I'll feel better as I go. Hopefully I can do the things I want and break through the fears that hold me back.

Hopefully this time I'll learn that alcohol is not my friend.

alcoholism,stephbower22,2019/01/28,"Feeling ashamed and worthless. Hoping I still have a job. Fuck you alcohol I just got a new job at a really amazing company, I’ve been there about 3 weeks now.
Last Monday I called in saying that I had a migraine but it was honestly because I still felt too shitty because I had been drinking and partying over the weekend.
Same exact thing happened this weekend so I had to make up one of the worst things to lie about- that a family member is in the hospital.
On top of feeling like a shitty human being for lying about that, I have the worst anxiety knowing that I’m fucking up and could possibly lose this job.
To top it all off, my parents won’t speak to me over all of this because they are over my bullshit.
I know I just need to stay home on the weekends but it’s so much easier said than done. Man I really fucked up 😔

alcoholism,throwawaytheinhalant,2019/01/28,"Alcohol is an absolutely horrible drug, and I feel like I'm on crazy pills because nobody takes me seriously I am way past the point of getting euphoria from alcohol. I may get some initial relief when I have my first drink of the day, but my GABA receptors are so up-regulated from consistent use that I need alcohol to prevent anxiety attacks, shakes, and feeling like I am dying. I am quite literally an alcohol junkie. A husk of a human being living only for a drip of booze. The effects are physical, present, and grave. Alcohol is poison.

No history of alcoholism in my family either. It could happen to anyone.

Weed, on the other hand, is purely psychological. I get cravings but that's it. It's not going to give me cancer, it's not going to disrupt my sleep, and it's not going to make me feel like a zombie. Weed is the antithesis of alcohol and it frustrates me to no end that it's illegal when a horrible substance like alcohol is pervasive.",4.537681498829041,6.194089907103827,6.853212334113977,69.21012295081968,70.69398907103826,10.693052302888367,32.74355971896956,10.7630783206399,4.218247775175643,755,36,128,25,14,269,105,183,0.215,0.6729999999999999,0.112,-0.977,0,0,10,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,3,3,11,3,1,12,0,14,16,2,3,1,23,30,10,2,2,6,0,4,4,0,1,12,0,0,1,11,5,10,1,4,1,0,4,5,6,0,1,0,4,16,5,18,27,2,16,0,1,0,0,2,4,0,2,11,89,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8201113892294055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07338184082784041,0.0,0.0,0.06707251360150696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912775997906736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058474574006506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658776260944059,0.0,0.0,0.061863249585480014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099554297742298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396931301702907,0.11124175509778607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08496047403426044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09042891010550563,0.0,0.14550665237873156,0.20558505615742054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159317601486794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15034949130840833,0.0920193466874251,0.16354800174314746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482555774453575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1874551060932089,0.0,0.08470293034084392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403022722922214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0711266664551137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0729547664678963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09157061573638592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067948613081148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10202731990953354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09599359354470807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07212314931961475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08284781217436286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0761402588374581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,stopdrunking,2019/01/28,"Having cravings or urges to drink. Check out the smartrecovery urge log tool. It helped me. Smartrecovery has a tool called an urge log.  It's a journal of all your urges and cravings.  It's a document where you write about the time of your urge, how strong, how long, what's going on now, and your response.  It does two things: first it is an immediate distraction from your craving.  Instead of thinking about urges you learn to go write about it.  Second, its a great learning tool.  As you go along you will see patterns of why you're having urges and how best to respond.  I did one for almost a year and it helped me a great deal.  Thanks for reading

alcoholism,Necturion,2019/01/28,"I am turning into an alcoholic Hi

I am 20 and my life is going downhill now. I hardly enjoy anything anymore which bugs me because I had so many interests before and I am drinking daily for a week now. Now, I had phases where I drank for longer periods of time daily, but the difference is it was fun then, these days I drink out of desperation, because I lost all of my interests because of work, because I don't ahve time and not many friends anymore, to punish myself (yesterday so I can feel worse than I actualyl did before), to remind myself what a failure I am &amp; because it is somehow making me feel better sometimes. I used to shower every day, wash my hair every 1 or 2 days, now I shower 1-4 times a week, wash my clothes twice a month (I only have 2 long sleeverd sweaters, so imagine how I smell, I also wear them to gym). Don't ask me why, I just don't give a fuck anymore. I just wanna get fired and have fun in life again. I have suicidal thoughts, listen to depressive shit, sometimes about alcoholism to feel less alone and do nothing but watch silly documentaries on weekends and drink and hope I get cancer from smoking and drinking soon &amp; die. I don't even try to hide it from strangers or friends, last saturday I went out for a walk with a beer at 9AM and met a friend and talked to him like I wasn't partly drunk already with a beer in my hand. He gave me weird looks, that's about it. I don't give a shit anymore, I am alone most of the times and I deserve to die soon. Life is not for everyone. Why do I have such pointless dreams that could never be a reality when other people dream of just having a fucking job and family to take care of?",5.176415929203543,5.088458404129796,6.0228598820059,82.07145796460178,68.20353982300885,8.667905604719763,31.10929203539823,8.238735603445708,2.133287787610619,1305,48,267,16,20,431,182,339,0.203,0.662,0.134,-0.984,3,2,8,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,1,3,22,21,5,0,15,0,29,23,5,3,2,41,54,23,3,3,9,0,7,1,3,0,8,1,2,0,10,17,10,0,5,11,0,3,9,8,0,1,11,11,42,13,36,41,4,37,0,2,2,2,14,8,4,5,27,177,52,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18006931975661586,0.0,0.17450943022363427,0.09296890521876687,0.06737247357682202,0.0,0.1825636612524236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33420242816315593,0.0,0.0,0.06932828597544546,0.0,0.07875978071031853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25678162509858937,0.0,0.14337636287845906,0.0,0.0,0.07450982222378927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858956583528871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06726455208832824,0.0,0.0,0.16299746717954808,0.0,0.07256200948580238,0.0,0.17487063253831886,0.08802041664203973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33012082007781435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05564449605647409,0.0,0.14196383740025542,0.0805018316507322,0.0,0.0,0.07942078377587644,0.0,0.12779378146922146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19526758588302334,0.15577039973826118,0.08803139339757901,0.16163522545904155,0.04787963815356711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546896372212193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08367650140685576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360236899648177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06867273084925378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785189146946275,0.04115893753265057,0.0,0.0,0.07455614100759704,0.07074644888515605,0.0,0.09196579560407664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056235675360447296,0.17082692144070433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724532941502674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649766518433325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083748236638642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407380920887143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123153238104434,0.0,0.05840641652405437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1729571269275776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16664531494513599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09215278778539787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06334342679421089,0.0677147263996062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668828843388659,0.19650093228052185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057198334098458176,0.09163678612759317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07276255092898541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351560807143692,0.0,0.0,0.07809801950441506,0.15204002938712546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06133298152458415,0.0,0.08585511740005602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,anewvogue,2019/01/28,"What can I do to help my alcoholic husband in the beginning of his recovery process? He has started going go AA meetings 2x a day, and he has a coworker in recovery and has chosen him to be his sponsor.

However I’m under the impression while this is a good first step there may be more that needs to be looked into.

Should he see a doctor to discuss quitting alcohol and the possible withdrawal/urges he may experience?

Should he see a psychologist or a counselor to see if there any underlying issues like depression?

I have advised him marriage counseling is going to be a requirement for me, it’s been a rough time, and I’m willing to make it work now he’s trying to recover, but I feel like we need to have a third party guide us through on how to get passed the resentment I may have and learn how to move forward with how our relationship dynamic will change.

I’m proud of him for making the first step, I just want to do what I can to help him succeed.
I know maybe this is something I should let him take care of his own, but I’m not sure, this is why I’m turning to this sub for advice.",5.481704781704785,5.403323594594597,6.537567567567568,78.60732848232848,67.55855855855856,10.434372834372835,33.29313929313929,10.214889679676881,3.2195858627858627,866,36,177,20,13,291,127,222,0.038,0.805,0.157,0.9773,1,0,3,0,0,0,16.0,3,0,0,7,7,11,1,0,14,0,28,3,0,5,1,33,53,13,0,7,6,1,2,2,0,8,3,0,0,0,9,8,2,1,3,0,0,8,1,2,1,3,1,6,21,9,28,39,2,22,0,1,4,0,25,7,0,5,11,123,30,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14133254143864027,0.0,0.30913486230790976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09835459782129416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14746178057237552,0.0,0.15300128897485654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932755593627184,0.0,0.12457117537566872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480367972252482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147767347165174,0.0,0.0,0.07313019432681271,0.10332500172121636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24604750587669905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755641569411054,0.0,0.2465927905091401,0.12131030932713828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19388732162909236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15095804445113425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07948586629579339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14789583593505615,0.0,0.141319604073512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12145430306754278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193085727017142,0.0,0.14530210389191334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15372073651915838,0.0,0.2144853250891428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16305064668928365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15383374456737914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15528044865572793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457585070414385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11134464176950884,0.0,0.0,0.10237114722063244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13631377951329485,0.0,0.1087451296345562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433597784178222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09819551248190374,0.15731788902285834,0.0,0.0,0.17397427244822194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08530759522451628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13050772228552482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10529368814278138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm totally restless. I live with a friend so no one in my family knows how bad it is, they know I drink but they don't know how bad but I'm embarrassed to talk about it. Then I don't want the attention it might bring from them. I'm definitely a high functioning alcoholic if I am at all. I'm a server and Im excellent at my job, I outsell everyone and my sales/tip ratio is the highest in the restaurant. I'm not blacking out and waking up places or getting DUIs or any crazy shit like you see on tv but I'm definitely addicted. I can't imagine day to day life without drinking. It makes things easier. I really do feel like it helps with my anxiety and being a server I'm so much more friendly and I make more tips compared to when I don't drink. I feel happier with it. I generally feel like it helps but I realize that not being ok with being sober isn't positive. I'm conflicted but I'm pretty sure I'm addicted. Also, not related but kind of related. Why is it that when I come and drink after work or I just drink when I'm free during the day is that super frowned upon but someone that smokes weed and is high all the time seem to be a bit more socially accepted? Like i have a friend who smokes weed all the time but gives me shit for my drinking. Is there a certain amount of hypocrisy in that?",0.9147797447509304,2.9211969538904934,3.2731132153149467,89.25442074927956,82.34293948126802,6.847558666117745,24.323507616303004,7.957251820313856,1.3975965253190616,1281,50,281,25,35,441,164,347,0.115,0.693,0.193,0.9869,1,0,14,0,0,0,27.0,0,1,3,5,12,21,2,2,19,1,22,21,5,4,6,65,55,32,0,3,22,0,4,4,3,1,6,0,0,0,17,15,12,1,13,11,1,5,16,6,0,2,0,6,33,16,32,50,10,31,0,0,2,0,13,13,2,9,16,172,50,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16049370031583546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15733553466923533,0.07371077860559902,0.0,0.0,0.05886668626574166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050058000963920976,0.0,0.05631220984510146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229242125157276,0.044872579440771,0.0,0.06263753520839259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08036414167673081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06340935440100437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0814491660842179,0.0,0.18989200887071608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6489967616684039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048619368087127184,0.0,0.0,0.07033846044256728,0.0,0.0,0.06939389506283815,0.0,0.1488797237422388,0.10517541935671408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17061501687239836,0.0,0.0384587068097063,0.07061437410146698,0.12550447481297092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09867979685744653,0.15554811590370726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07951250652514498,0.0,0.07304755437214278,0.0,0.0,0.07665452393465516,0.12136403360265087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0519936228448283,0.14385045607702554,0.0,0.06499985737669027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09827182178819156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780896332570549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05411255126094665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04988071541438992,0.05598447888734235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07690782268130032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07488884574787978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047157088441754036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058658432725948124,0.06701268539356144,0.0,0.0,0.15112125750675204,0.0,0.0,0.1473283123588292,0.07503713955419461,0.062370357355427127,0.0,0.07280315648011097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06937749182473796,0.0,0.0,0.059165729606037415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04890387434074487,0.04716695344182269,0.0,0.0,0.08584632652898999,0.08460501036644097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04341767216350788,0.0,0.059046300201876324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664224737092415,0.0,0.0,0.2838334902294897,0.0,0.1607690436228391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,mavaline_2,2019/01/28,"How do I (F23) talk to my SO (F23) about my alcoholism? Hi all,
This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll just get right to it - I have been with my GF for almost 3 years, and we have been through a lot together. 
To make a long story short, she suffered a traumatic brain injury early in our relationship, and due to the stress of that, and me trying to maintain a new/highly emotionally stressful job while visiting her weekly in hospital 1.5 hours away, I developed a major drinking problem. 
It started with me chugging wine in the hospital parking lot every time before I had to go see her hooked up to these horrifying machines, and hold her down when she was having a fit because of her symptoms. I used alcohol to power through it and be ""strong"". 
Eventually (months later), she was released,but not herself, and these habits of mine just worsened. 
Fast forward 1 year later. To now. The details aren't important at this point.. I have become a full blown alcoholic. I usually drink from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep. I know she knows it's a problem. She brings up her concerns about how much I drink, but I usually deflect or hide it. We don't live together so I'm able to conceal it to some extent, but I don't want to do this anymore. I want to make my life worth something. I don't want her to waste her second chance at life with me wasting everything away on gin. I just want to deal with this on my own and make it go away so no one has to know or deal with my fuck ups. 
I guess this was a bit of a word vomit. If anyone has any advice about talking to her or getting help, please let me know. Thanks in advance.

Does anyone have experience with this or know if ill experience withdrawals? Im working for the next two days and then on vacation, so im trying to get this schedule right so ill be getting sober on my vacation.

alcoholism,psilocybin1,2019/01/28,"Advice needed I got pancreatitis back in '16 and haven't had an attack since then. I took a year long break from alcohol. I had a drink in April '17 and I didn't have an attack so I have drank intermittently since then. Two weeks ago I started drinking beer again, every day. I just need to stop. I want to stop cold turkey but I don't want to have a grand mal seizure. I would go to detox but the detox in my city is a hellhole. The police send every strung out freak and wino in the city to the facility. Could I simply go to the hospital if my blood pressure gets too high or something? I'm afraid they would send me to the crummy detox, though.",1.1060874200426447,3.2671276044776114,2.4965884861407277,94.21104477611941,82.65671641791045,5.321108742004265,17.78038379530917,6.5431188927421005,-0.269881023454158,505,11,114,5,14,163,83,134,0.078,0.841,0.081,-0.1769,0,0,5,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,0,6,6,2,2,12,0,12,9,1,0,0,18,24,11,0,8,5,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,4,5,2,0,3,0,5,3,5,0,1,6,1,15,1,13,15,0,25,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,2,13,68,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16079096360647224,0.14585875539433066,0.17584801026316674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743862057533757,0.0,0.12652455006101776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13137537990328393,0.0,0.0,0.10611757857177953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3223818995684061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.277271645940579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859677006087518,0.0,0.18702884228818425,0.0,0.13160125381276533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17385027952747545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14561668880413864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2440152971812471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722257920071712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12667438128755004,0.0,0.0,0.1164654313829898,0.0,0.0,0.27513310981014555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16166411829025665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18281497406324326,0.0,0.0,0.16073604982793147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1941051975642281,0.0,0.13198765842350876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2337753582379836,0.0,0.0,0.10596125171222924
alcoholism,HolyCrepe215,2019/01/28,"Need help preparing for a hard conversation with alcoholic boyfriend This will be a bit of a long post, but I’ll try to be as concise as possible. I have been dating my boyfriend for close to 1.5 years now, and I found out about his drinking problem 8 months into the relationship through a very unpleasant incident. Basically that time he went on drinking bender for 4 whole days at a hotel while visiting me (we lived in different cities at the time), and eventually I had to go to work and had to call his grown up kids to come get him back to his town because there’s no way he could/would do that himself. 

From what I gathered talking to his kids (who seemed to know the drill as they are dragging him out of bed), he’s had a drinking problem for years and had gotten better after rehab, but went off the cliff again in that past year when his marriage fell apart. And I empathize with him completely as I know he’s going through a really hard time - he was married for almost 30 years before they called it quits, has 3 kids in their 20s, and he was raised in a very Catholic household so that religious component takes the guilt from divorce to a whole other level.

After that incident, he said he will quit drinking for good and as far as I know, he was doing well and stayed sober for about 8 months. By that point, he had rented an apartment in my city, I ended up moving into it so we were effectively living together 30% of the time (he has another temporary living situation in his town). While I didn’t like that he was still legally married (we started dating when he was 2 years separated) and he gets so stressed out/angry/anxious whenever I ask about the status of the divorce proceedings that it’s hard to talk about it, our relationship was super positive and loving and happy 90% of the time.

Then last December came, and it happened again. This time, he came back from a business trip in Europe and flew off to Miami to binge drink on his own in warm weather (he’s an entrepreneur so he has that flexibility). I hear very little from him over 6 days, all the while being worried sick, and also just angry and disappointed and depressed by what he did. When he finally came back, I didn’t ask any questions because  (1) I didn’t want to push him away when he’s feeling bad about it already, and (2) I was hoping maybe this was an one-off relapse and didn’t want to discourage him from recovery by focusing on it too much.

Fast forward to now - he’s at it again. I think his divorce finalizing (papers signed, going go through the court system now) probably triggered the drinking. I sensed something was wrong when he stopped answering calls/texts, and when he did he admitted he was drinking. I have no idea where he is, as he could literally just fly out to another city on a whim like he’s done before. In contrast to last time, where I would call every day just to check up on him/to make sure he’s ok, this time I texted him saying that I will need him to write me a letter explaining the whole situation, because it isn’t fair for me to be left in the dark like this. I admit that it’s partly my fault for not asking the “right” questions concerning his drinking, but I do feel like he should have been much more forthcoming about his alcoholism. I told him that we shouldn’t speak until he sends me that letter, which he agreed to. Though it’s so hard for me to not talk to him that I called him multiple times today, and he has not answered. 

So here we are in this period of limbo - I believe he’ll come back sooner or later in the next few days, unless something truly bad happened to him. When he comes back, I want to be ready to have that difficult conversation with him. I want to know how long he’s been an alcoholic, I want to know what triggers his drinking binges, and most importantly I want to know if he actually wants to recover and what he’s going to do about it.

Can you give me some advice on how to mentally prepare myself for the conversation? I.e. how should I frame my mindset going into it, and just how to bring it up without pushing him away. He’s a wonderful, wonderful man (I wouldn’t be staying with him if I didn’t think he was one in a couple hundred million), but he has a lot of trouble handling emotionally charged conversations and just overall not the most mature/emotionally developed adult. Any advice on this would be helpful!

alcoholism,KoKoRein,2019/01/29,"How long will it take for my body to recover from the damage? One of the biggest reasons I quit drinking completely is I want my self esteem back, my self worth, I’m looking forward to meeting myself again, I haven’t been sober for 17+ years. So I’m very excited to be me again. Im looking forward to seeing myself in the mirror as well. Not this puffy, tired, poisoned looking person. 

So for those that have long term sobriety, when did you start to see positive physical improvements? I have a gut, I want it gone! (The mental improvements were nearly instant, Ive never felt so happy and at peace in a long time).

Her death took a devastating toll on my family and has caused even more tension between us and him, regarding his alcohol abuse. Every time we try to get him treatment, it just doesn’t work. We have drained his bank account so that he cannot buy it, but still steals it. We have taken his drivers license so that he can’t show proof of age, but I suppose that he just gets past the carding requirement. He doesn’t have his own car, and we have no idea how he is getting his booze. He is my brother and I love him but I am so very fucking angry at him. Our single mother has gone through HELL and back to get his life on track and to help me solve my own demons that I won’t get into in this sub; is there ANYTHING I can do for him? My family seems to have given up on him and are about ready to kick him out of the house, and leave him likely homeless. I don’t want that to happen to him. I just want my brother to be a functioning member of society again. Is there anything I can possibly do? I have looked into a state law called Casey’s Law to force him into involuntary treatment, but my family can’t afford the costs of this. Please tell me there is still hope for my brother. 


TL;DR brother is in a catatonic state 24/7 and hasn’t been sober in weeks, mom has given up and I desperately want him to have a normal life again",4.367279279279277,4.861827218918922,5.1246621621621635,85.78005630630629,70.05405405405406,8.112612612612612,27.30855855855856,8.07648339933343,1.5350450450450457,1421,44,300,18,24,461,188,370,0.114,0.804,0.08199999999999999,-0.9349,1,0,3,0,1,0,35.0,6,0,0,2,21,11,2,2,10,0,41,7,0,3,2,48,63,23,1,6,8,9,0,1,0,1,4,2,0,0,12,23,3,1,2,2,4,4,9,7,1,1,8,4,59,4,41,51,8,41,2,1,2,2,51,18,2,2,18,210,71,3,0.0,0.1287351317602743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23223239233599946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17882306358899305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020823515779213,0.08354686216219498,0.0,0.06623339410086286,0.0,0.0924550495350988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11094608018154377,0.0,0.0,0.11161577518019204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674996868981058,0.0,0.0,0.14014340625035598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176377662220433,0.0,0.09154419428368188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3072829726196753,0.1222639717130603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044724063834383,0.34059785060036857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608081275280833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456546059198429,0.0,0.0,0.10791618544617054,0.0,0.25074018297178113,0.0,0.12265514833885033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885660733040141,0.0,0.11504702892649007,0.0,0.0,0.15348857389215287,0.053081993879549934,0.0,0.09594191427779963,0.09615380906051453,0.1824810255970621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980628843293463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545043693686312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645612143656626,0.0,0.0,0.11401224356318362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372085274963977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11926752658948095,0.0,0.24497813976651125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09891291422832964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17353963075597448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09496684260094553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06335599209993016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12071663113507355,0.07376773557690235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13069526094188366,0.0,0.0,0.08964947301789633,0.1922577101998398,0.0,0.08715426927107664,0.0,0.09769140804856012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910012126333096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996847716167291
alcoholism,Liabletolibel,2019/01/29,"Writing this from my hospital bed. Detoxing from 50 paracetamol and my years of denial. I hope this doesn’t break any rules or anything, just want to share. M/26, was functioning, not now, obviously. Mobile too.

I guess today is day one for me. I’ve known for years but always caveated it with ‘it’s too depressing to have to give up drinking at 23/24/25/26 and now here I am. Fully od’d on otc drugs and merlot last night. Hoped I wouldn’t wake up. Spent all day in bed. Drank some water - started to metabolise it obviously. 
Paternal side it runs.
Now I’ve got IVs all over the place.

alcoholism,fi057,2019/01/29,"Drinking alone Hello... this is my first time posting on reddit but here it goes.

I am a teenage girl who everyone sees as having her life together.  I am in no way trying to brag, I am just trying to explain my situation.  I am relatively popular (as popular as you can be at a small school) and I party a lot on the weekends.  I drink and smoke and fuck around.  People mostly think I’m having a good time.

Anyways, I don’t have any close friends (plenty of people I call my best friend but none I really mean) and I think I really need help.  I am very open and loving with my parents but this is something I don’t want to share because I don’t want them to think I’m a disappointment. I also have a therapist who I consistently lie to and conceal things from (probably not helpful but it’s hard for me to open up).  I drink alone ALOT stress on a lot.  

When I’m around people I don’t feel the urge to drink it’s just when I’m alone with my brain and all my thoughts that I feel the urge to drink and it is a really strong urge.  I mean it is 5 pm and I’m drunk, I started drinking once I got home from school.  I just want to escape from my brain and feel different for a while you know?

I have struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts and self harm, anxiety and ADHD and I also think I could possibly (I’m not a psychologist so of course I can’t diagnose) be bipolar.  So I guess these things along with family history could contribute to alcoholism even though I hate to call myself an alcoholic- I guess that is what it is at this point. 

I guess this post is too long, I don’t really know how to do this sort of thing but if anyone has any advice please help me. I am happy to answer any questions I just need help so please talk to me if you have the time...

Thanks and I’m sorry I’m such a mess :(",1.3545094562647757,3.2907093563829832,3.2647163120567377,90.25888888888888,80.43617021276594,6.943735224586287,21.08274231678487,7.984000788550335,0.8757260047281314,1402,40,312,26,36,471,172,376,0.156,0.662,0.182,0.9168,2,3,10,0,0,0,39.0,0,3,1,3,20,19,2,2,17,0,32,16,2,1,1,70,69,34,1,9,13,1,4,0,2,0,5,0,1,2,20,24,9,0,16,8,0,0,10,8,0,1,3,5,50,11,39,62,7,27,0,2,1,2,24,14,1,11,10,208,70,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08747202029112201,0.07112351685472157,0.0,0.15556755978441264,0.0,0.22614629401570985,0.0,0.11641040600533445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14848650193386367,0.0,0.05567943116020803,0.0,0.0,0.050892146635825,0.0,0.0,0.12958608053294352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044368347554215454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638213976709961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16250165192562105,0.14864085744349498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1162239324557484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06268860661003825,0.07387405593068723,0.0,0.07604361168641742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4278026691299909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04807303364415027,0.0,0.0,0.0695480691825065,0.0,0.0,0.068614117856824,0.0,0.11040507492148087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06190988909260205,0.0,0.0,0.11246521388493996,0.06728747852959409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061047623868180925,0.0582118782281988,0.0,0.2405387852499841,0.0,0.0,0.07747974104082862,0.06520001598038756,0.07185896419490449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19514186962795815,0.0,0.07300811648237182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000017962820544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05140937199803868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0644113996719217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375641993520735,0.065690248750767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585658575815912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10793657623917448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07751240413901972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08081783045112688,0.0,0.0,0.15137743131389775,0.0,0.0,0.15978957876129093,0.06880424569218517,0.08205283298477482,0.139413580734639,0.0,0.07847327959134699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08153454758921372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18650874237263776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473222445397332,0.05799928960191985,0.0,0.0759294088375829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08181207507226931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05603254866123481,0.0,0.08147553941181797,0.05151676988660738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08337363199545543,0.07608946276506062,0.0,0.07961369733879091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0585008860015358,0.0,0.06700957236351081,0.0,0.08450763709327809,0.14506302872749896,0.18654775896202247,0.07150974398139588,0.1155644628635656,0.12732251073459075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09883088658809436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060054282751281614,0.12878936708473768,0.05777241688998708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Jdover527,2019/01/29,Sweating after withdrawl from alcohol So i recently had a scare with alcohol. I have quit drinking after years of everyday drinking. It has been almost a month and im past the worst of my withdrawls. But i have had sweaty feet everyday that only stops when im at home with no socks or shoes on and not when im sleeping. Im wondering if anyone else has had sweating similar to this?. I read hyperhidrosis can be caused my alcohol withdrawl but should it be everyday? And for this long afterwards?

alcoholism,kidcudilove91,2019/01/29,"Moment of Clarity. So, I am a late 20's alcoholic. 

I have been sober for 3 weeks. I just had a moment of clarity.

My partner is in a pissy mood. I know somewhere deep down, my sobriety is affecting our relationship. We have been party partners for the 2 years we have been together and now that's all changing. It's almost like we don't even have anything to say to each other anymore. Every relationship, including this one, I have molded myself to the relationship. I have lost myself completely and made myself into whatever would make my partner happy. And for a split moment, I thought to myself ""X is unhappy because we are not having fun together...I can just break my sobriety today. We can do shots and have fun!"" but I just can't do that anymore. I can't compromise myself for another person, no matter how much I love them. I have done that for so many years...and it's always ended terribly for me. As scared as I am for my relationship, as heart-broken as I would be if we broke-up...I just can't be that person anymore. I deserve to be happy on my own. I deserve to have self-respect and I deserve to be sober. I deserve a new path. 

Thank you all for reading this, my brothers and sisters in recovery. We can do this.",2.091227891156464,4.292267583673471,4.381454081632654,81.83190901360547,79.28571428571429,7.348639455782314,26.12670068027211,8.344100000000001,2.0468945578231295,958,39,182,20,24,332,122,245,0.07200000000000001,0.821,0.107,0.7961,0,0,1,0,0,0,43.0,8,1,1,1,9,11,0,1,7,0,37,2,0,4,2,34,44,15,0,3,7,2,0,1,3,2,1,1,0,5,10,15,1,0,2,1,0,0,6,3,0,1,8,1,40,7,26,30,5,17,0,1,0,1,23,6,0,2,11,145,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13383807224317598,0.12540470953185034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104205508484113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13131976164000406,0.0,0.0,0.3725982481480047,0.0,0.0,0.10305769088724874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634206146192203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13248196864137346,0.0,0.13130645950921696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12815883169360676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11092099157209573,0.0,0.0,0.0827165015473757,0.0,0.10551584440689153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666298601887308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14840401548776905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06882585183816473,0.0,0.1412704753614419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06118346937049352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136708738752342,0.0,0.1130294294023923,0.1185003351532804,0.08359529976242731,0.12696858012104714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09206209595499944,0.0,0.0,0.12095269245361386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486244137037663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21870065082347329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526883761691585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5378218619532603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995918566251546,0.1253820296220627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13064736272098149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11529951359268538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09942255924636198,0.0,0.0,0.1187080866659784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045592063769468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1779266267369487,0.0,0.0,0.08064720004744455

Had to make up a lie about getting in a fender bender this morning. Missed a meeting with my boss and our CEO that I setup. I think this is a wake up call. I try not to go out on weeknights but sometimes it happens but my anxiety was particularly bad today and couldn't deal with the stress of work.,0.8051851851851843,3.0519001358024687,2.3422222222222224,94.30000000000004,84.67901234567901,4.587654320987656,21.34567901234568,5.82211442006289,0.003997530864197518,305,10,67,2,9,99,61,81,0.17600000000000002,0.7979999999999999,0.026,-0.905,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,1,0,0,1,2,4,0,1,6,0,4,1,1,3,0,15,11,4,0,1,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,5,7,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,3,0,8,1,15,7,0,11,0,1,0,0,6,6,0,0,3,44,13,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21379724723711532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333495553357232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2853747379076581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28812596435462423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21592132532163366,0.0,0.14601390481445942,0.0,0.1588318134720783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24713840013474125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278090394476862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18655141608795686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2622679102851639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2764074521038296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32013712499145536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17907599140863914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2649091723047273,0.0,0.0,0.18974485778905334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2590756852981737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20346078326561887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Sprout_knowledge,2019/01/29,"Did alcohol ruin my brain? I’m an 18 years old and last year was a really low point of my life. I was drinking a lot, mostly by myself, but I’ve managed to do it a lot less now.

In school, I always excelled. I passed all my classes with flying colors with minimal effort. I even skipped a grade and started taking college classes my sophomore year of high school. 

Once I started drinking, my grades slipped a bit, but I chalked that up to not giving a shit. Now I’m in college and I feel like a fucking idiot. I’m not understand the material while others in my class are. I can’t get myself to focus. This shit used to come easy to me but I feel quite literally retarded now.

I’m just worried that I’ve caused permanent damage to no point of return.

I always knew getting sober would be hard, but damn, I gotta work my way up to being able to post here.  Like working out at the dirt gym before going to the good one that all your friends go to, so no one knows how much of a slob you really are...

alcoholism,HFSfan,2019/01/30,"What about sick leave banks for alcoholics? Hello Reddit. I sent this question to AA months ago, but so far have only received an auto-response. Turning here to r/alcoholism, which has already helped me immensely, I have a strong feeling that some of you will have insights and suggestions regarding this question.

Our cohesive Eastern Shore Hospital Group recently reviewed the Big Book chapter “For Employers” and up popped the question, “What are some of the AA guidelines for employers to consider regarding utilizing sick leave banks for employees seeking time off to treat alcoholism at treatment center programs?”

Understandably, treatment and rehabilitation is expensive and often not fully covered by insurance, so we think it’s great that sometimes fellow employees would like to chip in some of their own accrued sick leave time to help suffering colleagues seeking treatment. However, it’s a delicate subject, considering anonymity, potential stigmas and such; but I imagine that there must be constructive ways to address this and hope Reddit has some suggestions.

I’ve heard that some employers use boards that vote on whether the sick person is justified or qualified in being granted some of their fellow employees donated sick-time. Many employers have policies that differ from others standards. Also, some people may want to donate and / or exclude donating some of their sick time, for under specific circumstances.

Perhaps some of the solution lies with employing a type of double-blind mechanism, which identifies aspects of the ill candidate’s situation; but never their actual name, or at least follows a protocol, attempting to keep the ill persons name vague or obscured. (This might be impractical for smaller organizations)

Undoubtedly, there are aspects about potential sick leave banks that I haven’t even considered yet. However, I look forward to hearing suggestions from concerned Redditors. And perhaps we can layer this feedback into a comprehensive Grapevine letter, seeking experienced insights from the thoughtful editors and readers there.

Thank you,

alcoholism,Wubbalubbadubdubzz,2019/01/30,"Today I'm going to try to quit. (aside from the occasional social situation) I'm going to try to change the issue I've had that has defined me for probably 8 years. Maybe, probably, even longer. I don't know what I'm going to do, and I'm not sure how I'm going to cope with the plethora of other issues I have as an individual, but I have hit an ultimatum. I have a choice between making a change or committing suicide. I'm going to try to change. I'm at a new college. I feel completely alone here. I am completely alone here. I've made many amazing friendships elsewhere, but those are scattered miles and miles away from me. I used to drink to party.....in earlier years of college and in high school. Now it just fills the voids. My inadequacies. My lack of any friendship at all at this new place. I started using it to beat my social anxiety, now that I have to quit I have to figure out how I'm going to not act like a total weirdo in public. I'll have to come to terms with the many things in my life I'm not particularly fond of.....My past, my mistakes, my somewhat toxic family. It stops the pain when I drink it, but sometimes not even during that anymore, because it's typically solitary drinking. Eventually the pain goes away, but when I wake up it's always in immense panic and anxiety. I'm so frightened that the anxiety is physically hurting my body. I'm afraid I may go through withdrawl. I'm too busy as a student to detox or go to rehab. If I feel like I'm going to die I might try to ween, but I don't think I'm even capable of that. I'm just going to hope stopping doesn't kill me. It filled a void for so long, without it a lot of me is going to feel empty. I hope I can find something to fill that void back up. I hope I can do this, because I'm so lonely and I think about suicide constantly now. I'm so fucking scared. I'm too scared to leave my apartment to get food. I don't know what to think, or what to do, or anything. I don't have the energy to make superficial friends anymore, I don't like a lot of the people that flag me down and (literally) pretend to like me. (They just take my number and never call, I wish they would just save the effort and let me attempt to pursue others that are actually interested) I don't know ANYTHING, except one thing.....If I don't change, I WILL die. If you believe in God, pray for me. If you don't, wish me luck. I don't know if I'm going to beat this, but for the first time in years I'm going to try. I'm out of other choices. I can't emphasize enough how much the thought of all of this scares the shit out of me.

alcoholism,3cupsofmilk,2019/01/30,"6 Beers a Day and Climbing Hi all,

This is my first post on reddit. i joined specifically to be a part of this group. I need help. I have a couple questions, i would really appreciate it if some of you took the time to answer some of them. My questions most relate to withdrawals. But before i get into that, let me tell ya whats goin on here. I'm 21 years old and I started to drink a beer or 2 every night about a year ago (IPA's ABV 8%). It felt so good to be buzzed before bed. Then over time my tolerance started to go up, and I've been at 6-8 IPAs a night, but i lowered the ABV to no more than 7%. usually around 6.5-6.9 ABV is where I'm at. Im trying to lower it down, but when i lower the ABV i just drink more. I can usually stop myself after beer number 8, so thats good i guess lol. I don't get drunk, i just get buzzed before bed. My drinking has slowly started to creep into the day time as well. If i don't have work until 6, i may have a couple before, but if i work super early, i definitely wont drink until Im off. I generally stop drinking around 2 or 3am, and don't drink again until around 6 or 7 pm the next day, sometime even 9pm. My question is based on that story, if i just ween off to light beers and keep it to 6 a night, and keep dropping that down, will i experience these crazy ass withdrawals I'm hearing about. Thanks in advance!!

alcoholism,2planks,2019/01/30,"I might have to evict my friend today. Took in an old friend when his marriage was on the fritz. At the time I had no idea that he had alcohol and drug addictions. He checked himself into a detox facility in the fall, and I was so proud of him for his brave efforts. The holidays hit him hard, and he fell off the wagon, but got back on quickly and vowed to attend more AA meetings more frequently. Just discovered that he's been drinking again, including while he was watching my kids. The thought of him driving my kids in his car while he was drinking has kept me up at night. He was just released from the hospital (he blacked out in a coffee shop, doctor says he had the equivalent of 30 drinks in his system) and he's headed back to my place. I plan to present him with a contract he must adhere to if he is to stay here anymore. This includes a strict shcedule, submitting to breatalyzer tests and madatory AA meetings. If he does not comply, I am prepared to evict him. I just can't have a ""drunk uncle"" around my kids.

alcoholism,Pure_Significance,2019/01/30,"Occasional binge drinker doing Dry Jan. Hi guys, doing dry Jan and feel fantastic. Literally had a two week bender (which I have never done nor am proud) but had some personal circumstances and in between a holiday also Christmas spirit and stopped New Year’s Day. I also suffer with PAWS from porn addiction (Yes, porn can be crippling if abused, believe me. and can give you paws.) I probably shouldn’t be drinking based on that but there you go. 

Anyway, I find that I try and keep up with people when I’m drinking and never really drink how I would like to I suppose you could say easily led but I know I can moderate or not touch it at all myself indoors.  I’m literally drinking a green tea right now and sitting behind me less than a few yards is a cabitnet full with wine, whisky, vodka and god knows what else. 

My question is it seems that bender I had really gave me the worst insomnia I’ve ever had in my life is that usual for a non-alcoholic? Literally probably three days I’ve had refreshing sleep this month and the rest I’ve either stared at the ceiling or had broken sleep, tossing and turning. 

It’s definteky made me ‘grow up’ in a sense from this experience. And I’ll never do something like that EVER again. Would I be able read a book once every two weeks on a sat perhaps and have a glass or two of red? Or has that bender fucked up my sleeping pattern for good?

Sorry for the rambling.

alcoholism,SeaPaleontologist5,2019/01/31,"Extremely functional; but that's the problem. I am 22. 

In college and very stressed because I am going through some medical/legal stuff regarding my (at one time) very promising career that I am skilled in and put in a shit ton of loans for. Currently fighting for my future for some other shit unrelated to the alcohol.

I apologize I am drunk while I write this.

but...

I have been downing half a liter of rum half a night at this point.

I only drink during the night so I guess I have some self control. I use it as an escape. I could def not go a night without it though.

The point I want to discuss though is that I don't feel like a normal drunk. I can get extremely shitfaced, even kill a fifth and still be the same person.

I have gone to kickbacks and parties where I drink way more than everybody where they start acting all weird and I am still my normal self (with less anxiety of course)

I dunno. I feel like alcohol def does effect me but it does not make me act crazy like it does everyone else. I am a normally  quiet dude and I can get shitfaced and still seem completely sober.

I feel like that is my problem though. Alcohol is the perfect solution for me. It makes me forget about my underlying problems (described above) but I don't engage in reckless behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I in danger of becoming a lifelong alcoholic?

alcoholism,CandyCoatedSalt,2019/01/31,"Day 0 Hi  guys. I'm trying to detox at home, starting today. Any tips on what's  the best, fastest way to hydrate?  I know withdrawal symptoms can be  worsened by dehydration. I vomited water four times this morning. Is  there anything I can do besides just trying to intake as much water as  possible?

alcoholism,clit_eastwould,2019/01/31,"Withdrawal symptoms? I've been a drinking on and off for at least 8 years. The past 2 years I've drank about 8 beers every night, I cant remember the last time I went to bed sober.

About a month ago I went to get a haircut, out of the blue I started sweating, heart pounding, extremely light headed and seeing black spots. 
I saw my doctor and was told it was anxiety.

I've been given medication  to lower my heart rate, but I am still always light headed. I do also feel odd tention in my chest at times and then I start to wonder if my breathing is normal. 

It never occurred to me that it could be alcohol related because it's never happened before, I still dont know if it is. I'm just wanted to know if anyone here has felt this way? 

Thank you.

alcoholism,Spicy582,2019/01/31,"Having an alcoholic parent I am 36 years old.I have a son who is 13 years old.
My parents divorced when I was a baby.
My mother walked in my father in bed with another woman.My mother is 63y and only since last year did she find a man.They seem happy.
My mother is an alcoholic.I have known for years.All the family knows.
Even my son knows her sneaky ways.
My mother was a sports teacher.Happy outgoing,helping everyone,funny as hell.
Now she complains about everyone and everything.She hasn't come to visit me in 5 years.
I was seriously sick at Xmas she wouldn't come,used having no money as an excuse.
She can drink tins and tins of beer,plus hard alcohol and not be drunk at all.Seem normal.
She loved driving.She stopped driving 3 years ago.She didn't leave the house for 2 months.
Her bf was the one bringing in the food and alcohol.
She used to be very close to her sister,brother in law and mother,all lived in the same house.
Of course they had fights like every family.
My mother would cry to me how horrible her mother and sister were to her.
I was always in the middle.
My aunt and uncle paid for everything for years.She had no money worries.
My mother quit her job years ago to look after my aunt's house.My aunt and her husband paid my mum.
Now my mother lives with her bf.
She left her sister.My grandmother died last year.
My mother's drinking is out of control.
Doctors 10 years ago told her her liver was fatty she should stop drinking immediately.
5 years ago I begged her to stop.She hasn't.
I believe she has deep rooted depression.
She uses the alcohol as an escape,but in the process she has become an alcoholic.
Recently I found out from the rest of the family,how she has fallen out with everyone,because she has been saying things she shouldn't.
She is saying everyone is lying about her.
Accused my uncle of being an alcoholic.
Accused other members of family of lying.
She is my mother.
But I know she is manipulating and lying to me.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Any advice is welcome.
Thank you.

alcoholism,Sazzer1,2019/01/31,"I have a question about alcoholism and withdrawals. I’m a regular weekend drinker, meaning I’ll party on a Friday or Saturday night every weekend, but never any other time. No cravings, no true hangovers other than some fatigue.

I recently partied 2 and a half weeks in a row and I am on the tail-end (I think) of beating the withdrawals that came after it. Anxiety, insomnia, heart racing, muscle spasms, and some shakes is what I dealt with.

I regret partying that long, and I never want to do it again, but I’d like to resume my weekend partying. If I went out in a few nights and drank, say, 6-8 drinks, would I expect the withdrawals to comeback, or would I need to repeat something like the 2 and a half weeks I did?

I’m just worried that I may have hurt my ability to drink on weekends following the 18 days I just did.

I’m 24 if it matters, and I started my weekend stuff at 21.",4.306016949152543,5.114731762711871,5.5625,81.4535805084746,70.35593220338983,8.159887005649718,32.264124293785315,8.344100000000001,2.4988836158192087,690,31,133,10,12,231,106,177,0.146,0.7120000000000001,0.14300000000000002,-0.1363,0,0,5,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,0,1,4,7,0,1,12,0,10,7,1,0,3,35,22,14,0,8,8,0,0,2,0,3,3,1,0,0,10,11,4,0,3,7,0,4,4,4,0,2,5,1,17,3,17,14,3,31,0,3,0,0,2,7,0,8,22,92,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832231132712152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11658882781979067,0.0,0.1311553480234741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19608799303517332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056817242132208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359026651072887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15184983661482634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1444502389166587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20316375814360305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18353596737070785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675192350115075,0.0,0.0,0.1517238837505827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18675442441136925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1271246753615207,0.2644586975008621,0.0,0.0,0.3217799994467698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920582114826311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16928176054725955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13634035309599066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13198713182182306,0.0,0.0,0.12135001638364395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962640941741607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985536193457314,0.0,0.0,0.09997125724081224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10112300544833497,0.0,0.2750464978653037,0.0,0.0,0.15893170800284848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17411124040961512,0.0,0.24357994655927484,0.0,0.0,0.0

All it takes is that one story that is similar to yours to make you feel like you are not alone. So I'm encouraging you all to post your experiences, tell others how you stay sober, and support others. I often post anonymously because I have a fear of being judged by others who may internet stalk me, but the more I open up to those who are struggling like me, the better I feel. 

That being said, there is nothing wrong with posting your current state, even if it is awful. It is the act itself of sharing that will help this small community stay strong.

alcoholism,AcJunkie,2019/02/01,"Weird form of alcoholism. I started drinking everyday when I was 21.

Now I’m a 120 pound, 5’4, surprisingly fit bricklayer. My work is intense physical, and im the featherweight. 

So the construction helped to my addiction for obvious reasons. 

I’ve had my time and trouble but I’ve always been a happy person. 

As the years went on, I got worse. I’m now 29.

I can now legit drink 10 beers, sleep at 10pm, be up for 5:30 am and feel no troubles whats so ever. Remeber, I’m a midget. 

I have no physical pains whats so ever or hangovers. Weekends I can climb to 14.

I started dating a really respectable girl 9 months ago. She’s really cute, and I’m a short dude. 

I haven’t changed any of my habits. 

My only rules are when I have a responsible thing to do, I do not drink or smoke till that is taken care of. I always wait till I’m home, safe and have nothing to do, and I don’t get withdrawal or anxious at all. I can stay up without drinking easily. 

My girlfriend also had a conversation with me about it. She says she really dosent mind cause I’m still fully functional all night, I just get a little funny.

I rollerblade, skateboard, blew up a four wheeler this year. 

I am a little worried for my health, but I just don’t feel like it’s a problem for me. Yet im severe. I know it’s a problem cause I have friends who drink like me and they ALL have problems.

alcoholism,stringerhye,2019/02/01,"Perspective needed please Brother (59), lifer, recently divorced, now living with mother in her condo in Colorado. Has relapsed 4 or 5 times in the last 6 months since he moved from CA to CO. Mother often rescues. Has myriad medical issues but often complains of back pain, had scripts for Morphine and Oxycontin, as well many other maladies, some real and some imagined. While not drinking is addicted to narcotics. Mother is 90, has health issues of her own, has little experience with addiction, is protective. Relapsed last weekend, told mother he had cancer, went to ER and spent 6 days hospitalized for pneumonia, Afib, infected colon, etc. Will be discharged tomorrow and will be back to condo with mother. Family tried to get him into rehab (again), no success. Family feels brother is endangering mother. Suggestions? Brother has been to AA, detox, rehab, sober living, many times.

alcoholism,SlorpThemSoupGood,2019/02/01,"I can't live like anymore. My mom's an alcoholic. Every night I hyperventilate wondering if she's going to come downstairs completely out of it. I constantly walk on eggshells around her, afraid that if I say the wrong thing it'll set her off as it has done in the past. My dad and I have grown closer due to this because we talk about it. 

I'm starting to not love her anymore. I can't love someone who puts me through pain everyday. Right now I'm going through a period of time where I'm very mentally fragile due to the things going on in my life. It hurts that even with everything going on, she still continues at our expense.

She won't stop lying. She always has excuses. She makes promises, and then breaks them. She told me she loved me enough to quit, and she proved herself wrong. Countless times it has happened, and I still get my hopes up only to have them crash down. 

It gets harder and harder to tell her I love her, to smile at her, to laugh at her jokes and hug her. It feels like she's broken me. She's caused me to cry myself to sleep. She's ruined holidays, burnt bridges, and I don't think she will ever stop. She's been given every opportunity, but frankly she just doesn't want to stop. 

It's getting harder and harder. When she's drunk, sometimes I just want to die, and that's not at exaggeration. I can't keep living like this. I don't want to end each day paranoid and upset. I'm not old enough to move out yet, and I don't know how to help her change. 

If any of you have any tips on how to deal with an alcoholic family member, please share them. I'm at the end of my rope and each day is painful because of the abuse she's put me through. Thank you for reading this.

alcoholism,cgregorski,2019/02/01,"Drinking to cope with social anxiety? Or social conditioning? 29M Hey everyone 👋 I have a troubled history with alcohol since around age 15. I have begun to drink with less frequency over the past few years and to less excess. I can enjoy 1 or 2 glasses of wine or a beer at home or out to dinner with my girlfriend or close friends/family. (rarely even catching a buzz). This moderation, for me, doesn’t even require a little will power. 

However, when I am out at a bar or a more busy place (even if I’m with people I know). I drink to excess (blacking out, hung over, etc). My behavior becomes erratic as it always has when I have had too many in the past (anger, risky behavior, rarely verbally abusive toward others). As a result, I try very hard to avoid these busier settings where I know alcohol is part of the environment.  I would estimate I’ve had about a dozen or fewer of these incidents over the past 3 years- with declining frequency

I know this is entirely because I accept more drinks- but I can’t decide whether it is my response to social anxiety (which I don’t think I have when sober) or if it is just a conditioned response to situations that make me feel like I’m back at a college house party? 

Any shared experiences?",4.039789473684209,5.768263733333337,5.364649122807016,79.09894736842108,72.08333333333334,9.052631578947368,29.298245614035093,9.549672527348893,2.840291666666667,976,40,183,24,19,326,145,240,0.045,0.877,0.078,0.8771,2,1,8,1,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,2,12,7,1,1,14,0,18,10,0,2,0,37,26,18,0,3,13,0,2,1,1,2,2,0,1,0,10,12,10,2,7,7,0,1,3,3,0,1,2,3,20,4,33,22,7,29,0,0,1,0,6,16,0,10,12,126,30,2,0.0,0.14058526411807865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536094985642805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872940603281602,0.0,0.0,0.08068860318350339,0.0,0.18153955280205653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10562697309906373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123739202116823,0.0,0.0723302106875224,0.1310437193440805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4649419221371139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323302703239281,0.2351090029409521,0.0,0.0,0.1133787209616991,0.0,0.11606611289104216,0.11185617392349896,0.0,0.05999488952707751,0.08476624629146727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10629043344309083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11901936263496048,0.0,0.0,0.13691047022713712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1956269559220253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05796821759088445,0.11892220592692272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920228414736771,0.12029625575976285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12849042364174035,0.3398052251699357,0.08225955441839071,0.0,0.12396789057779845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09815158912500896,0.13337176056714367,0.0,0.3628575968431555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07602851724712391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055809201161379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09790175121533326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08428820333351035,0.0,0.0,0.15281821997169767
alcoholism,dontaskagain88,2019/02/01,"A heartfelt thank you I just wanted to thank everyone in this forum for giving me the hard truth. I posted in here about 2 months ago asking for advice on my alcoholic tendencies. At that time I was in a dark place I had been drinking every day for 3yrs. My story was about a functional alcoholic with a good job but a stressful one and that i was stuck in a rut that seemed to repeat every day. What I didn't tell you is that I was on the edge of losing everything my wife my job and my health. In fact I didn't even know I was that close until looking back. 2 months ago I didn't know what to do i scrolled this sub and others, I  posted. You ppl commented, and i didn't receive the comments I expected I was surprised most comments were a harsh truth. But also made me feel like I wasn't alone. The booze creeps on you one day it's a couple and before you know it it's too late. I posted right at the too late point. If I were to explain how the multiple comments hit me in a few words its "" your in deep god speed, and there is no such thing as a functional alcoholic"" I received alot of help and I'm so happy I posted. I'm a month sober and I also quit smoking ( 8 yrs smoking). It has not been easy but my method has been hitting the gym as soon as I get off work even if it's just slowly riding a bike. And after I get a sweat I still have a "" mind craving"" but my body doesn't want the alcohol and that's enough for me. I'm sorry for the long winded happy Story, but I feel like I've been reborn, it really is amazing how fast I felt like a different person ( clear minded and my stressful job is not as stressful) a fresh chance to rebuild and I had no idea that a depressing post on a Reddit sub would get me here so again thank you! And if anyone needs a random guy to vent to, get in touch I won't touch the stuff again and I'd like to help if I can thanks to the sub that somehow changed my life in 2 months",2.506642335766422,3.370094883211685,3.964678832116789,91.03898905109492,74.62043795620437,6.93985401459854,22.45912408759124,7.1686216300943375,0.536880875912408,1491,36,342,15,30,495,190,411,0.09,0.735,0.175,0.9889,4,1,6,0,1,0,30.0,0,7,0,3,24,21,0,3,31,0,31,10,2,3,4,57,60,34,0,9,13,1,6,4,0,2,6,0,0,2,22,16,6,0,9,3,0,3,11,5,0,2,22,7,50,16,41,34,4,52,0,2,1,0,22,21,0,9,27,229,72,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07510917330814887,0.13626798784832578,0.32857067045321664,0.0,0.07960639903356119,0.0,0.12293387259499948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05374406709248868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185608849890407,0.0,0.0,0.059102540000488035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06540435058814087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537694178251723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131036357944392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08504692587217473,0.0,0.1487099166747216,0.0,0.066201583196981,0.0,0.0,0.08030498296082972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07529601609128919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794195386227138,0.0,0.10153395037543772,0.0,0.12951999068403094,0.07344543988377356,0.06907908452025302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07772800777287184,0.10982121148246554,0.0738000810449473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16062999509671164,0.07373354115753368,0.0,0.06446864221480765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07610598755635742,0.0,0.1636431817507845,0.06885372822561582,0.0,0.0,0.08170127357581028,0.0,0.0,0.10303866536507957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676843897367792,0.0,0.0,0.22882259845635355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12672490665748828,0.0,0.1734085601607291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054290276997283324,0.15020459585812584,0.0,0.0,0.06802091902824188,0.06454516564453758,0.08598950875411376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727291829553183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15521848554719658,0.0,0.24540374785228755,0.0,0.0,0.0569925909850322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10416807710252687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06711339518834793,0.08030498296082972,0.0,0.07265993362767358,0.0,0.36806527784250265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08175276028959766,0.0,0.0,0.04924010395522707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564017939674174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997275922099222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08604130786385461,0.0,0.0,0.06138251457315678,0.0,0.2641373002266313,0.0,0.0879892059704842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06718123779018745,0.28305875786409496,0.0,0.0,0.05106404860694301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04481915849918199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067102153542438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055956836199707365,0.0,0.0,0.05460093497556637,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Hot_Lips_Hannigan,2019/02/01,"Question about urine. I checked into a detox program 9 days ago at the VA hospital, and it took 5 days to withdraw and recover enough for discharge from the hospital. My water intake has neither increased nor decreased since was released, but the color of my urine has changed dramatically since I stopped drinking alcohol. It was still that nasty orange color that scared me for the first couple days, but it eventually got lighter until my last one was clear.

Why the change in color without an increase in h2o intake?",9.140967741935487,9.162647827956992,8.031741935483872,70.60761290322583,59.96774193548386,10.020645161290323,41.18064516129033,9.3871,4.091371612903226,420,21,66,6,5,129,68,93,0.149,0.8170000000000001,0.034,-0.8898,0,0,2,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,1,7,0,5,6,2,0,1,9,7,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,0,2,5,3,6,0,12,2,4,16,0,0,3,0,1,4,0,1,9,45,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17660106743706372,0.2129110880947916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4215075669219833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22043882981503088,0.0,0.3854512044672465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19516479292672512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20585282747025885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16946080363798952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15933854526975935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16239508059804494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500011190925226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22317775336443166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19945912180999653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32960219167093724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15910145540060958,0.1665611390567205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22134646271843045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17976970277074442,0.0,0.0,0.19204592709951715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,twistygoldring,2019/02/01,"Worried for boyfriend’s safety My boyfriend has a history of severe depression and suicidality. He is on several antidepressants, including Trazadone for a sleep medication, which you’re not supposed to drink alcohol with. But he drinks 10+ beers every night. When he drinks he turns into a different person, hostile and with poor judgment. I have always been quite forgiving of it, because I am the only support system he has and I’m afraid that if he loses me he will lose his will to live and kill himself. Last night, he told me he was going to go meet a friend at a bar. He was already drunk enough that he couldn’t walk in a straight line. But from past experience I knew that any attempt to stop him would be met with hostility. When I try to stop
him from doing stupid things like this, he gets defensive, hostile, and tries to tell me that he’s fine. So I let him go, as long as he would take an Uber there and not drive. He promised me he would Uber. I didn’t trust him and tried to take his car key as an extra safety measure, but he got hostile and claimed that he needed it for the next morning. I argued but eventually decided to trust him and gave in. He left and I watched him out the window to make sure he got in an Uber. I see him walking out the door and towards his car, which was parked down the street. I immediately opened the window and started screaming to get his attention. He turned around once, vaguely acknowledged me, but then turned around and kept walking to his car, ignoring my screams. I called him and thankfully, he picked up. He was in his car now but hadn’t driven away yet. My body was now halfway outside our 2nd story apartment building window in order to have eyes on his car. I screamed at him in desperation to please get out of the car, that I would give him money for an Uber. He immediately got very angry with me and claimed ‘I’m fine! Relax!’. I knew he wasn’t fine. I kept screaming and begging him to please get out of the car. I told him that if he drove off I would call the cops and report a drunk driver. He got angry that I would do this and told me that I didn’t care about him if I would do that to him. I didn’t back down. Kept screaming. I couldn’t have gone after him
because by the time I got downstairs and all the way down the street to his car, he’d have had plenty of time to make his escape. About 5 minutes later I leaned outside the window again and his car was gone. He had driven off in the middle of my desperate screaming and even after my threats to call the cops on him. He said that he intended to get an Uber but saw that they were $90 so decided to drive. I checked the price to his destination from my phone. $8.51. So this was definitely a lie. After 15 minutes I finally convinced him to come back and get an Uber, which he did. 

Until yesterday, his behavior at night had been limited to just hostility towards me, and even pushing me out of his way one time when I tried to stop him from locking himself in the bathroom. But driving drunk and lying to me about it crossed a line, since this was no longer just between us, it was a matter of life and death. The next morning, he didn’t even remember which friend he had gone out to meet. Proof of the mental state he was in when he had gotten behind the wheel. He was disgusted with himself for attempting this, and is aware (in his sober state) of the danger of it, but this rationality goes away at night when he drinks, so he is bound to do it again. What if I’m not around to forcibly stop him next time?

I don’t know what to do. I know my forgiving attitude is enabling, but he is suicidal and without me in his life, I am afraid his risk of suicide will go up big time. He’s said that he’s attempted suicide multiple times during this recent bout of depression. But he is a threat to the safety of himself and others now because of his drinking. He is unwilling to go to any kind of inpatient treatment, not to mention that we can’t afford that. He has recently started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, so we do have those two resources. I’ve never had anyone with an addiction in my life so I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Advice is appreciated. Thanks.

alcoholism,ClemTheParrot,2019/02/02,"Charities/Organizations to Help Alcoholics? Hi everyone,

On Thursday, January 31st, my mother died from complications of liver cirrhosis from decades of alcohol addiction. To say we are heartbroken and devastated is an understatement. Despite being an alcoholic, she was an amazing mother. She was only 61. 

We're in the process of planning her funeral and my sister and I are throwing around the idea of setting up some kind of a donation box at her memorial where people can donate money to some kind of organization that would help people struggling with alcohol addiction. But we're not sure what, if any, legitimate organizations there are that would help with this.

alcoholism,Throw15away1515,2019/02/02,"How do I [M24] talk to my gf [24] about her excessive drinking? Tlrd, concerned about my gf when she gets extremely drunk. How can I address this?

We've been together 4 years. Whenever she goes out with her friends to a club and has a few drinks, she doesn't stop drinking until she can barely stand. Last week she got thrown out of a club for being too drunk.

I don't have an issue with her going out and drinking... it's the amount that worries me.

I'm concerned about her safety, being that excessively drunk is never safe, especially in a club.
She gets very emotional when drunk. Often cries, often gets angry and tries to start a fight with me. Often shouts, sweats excessively etc... it's not nice being around her like that. Even if it wasn't directed at me, which is usually is, it's extremely unattractive.
I don't understand why she repeatedly does it. Everyone drinks too much the odd time, but this isn't the odd time, this is the norm. She doesn't go out drinking that much, but when she does, she doesn't stop until in a bad state.
She'll undoubtedly get very defensive. I'm not sure how to approach this. I'm thinking using the ""I feel _ when you _"", I'm not great at difficult conversations.",3.065365754812561,5.149692225531915,4.038966565349547,86.03666666666668,75.68085106382979,7.54002026342452,23.9564336372847,8.418075326091056,1.4900901722391078,943,30,190,18,21,304,121,235,0.157,0.78,0.064,-0.9636,0,0,6,0,1,0,43.0,0,1,0,0,17,10,2,0,12,0,21,11,1,4,3,34,37,15,0,1,6,0,1,1,3,1,0,1,1,0,14,11,10,4,3,13,0,3,11,4,0,0,3,2,27,6,23,30,5,31,0,0,0,0,23,9,0,4,18,123,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10418154019553524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771518828592332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285519947314222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20482753912828194,0.0,0.0,0.6878692647609322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131643034071966,0.0,0.0,0.13051942105648168,0.07729723233115518,0.0,0.0,0.11182721068899333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059173900485910313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041711233773043,0.0,0.24457344571804376,0.0,0.13302172816990834,0.0,0.09359960740454598,0.1290260233182556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221489479431603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095395095785975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057174962169410065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17206107818404132,0.0,0.0902607752712372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08283445892664833,0.0,0.0,0.19568469384691745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11029942006896327,0.0,0.0,0.0940643066196299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07498811897373582,0.0,0.0,0.13648230545893214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07945570960470856,0.0,0.0,0.12183239049005908,0.0,0.10107637237755013,0.12889204625568362,0.19312406538219626,0.0,0.0,0.09387443244471122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056014009296158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884967816388335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536350356106479

alcoholism,MangoCulture,2019/02/03,"Can I Help My Dad? Hi👋
This is my first time doing this so I really don't know how to introduce the situation.
 Anyways, my father had a beer issue. To be quite honest I am very concerned not only for him but for the well-being of my family.
 And I have noticed patterns. Whenever my dad is in a stressful situation he will start drinking excessively. After the stressful situation is done, he will still countiue to drink and it will progressively worse. It will stop until my mother will threaten to leave him after he has done something violent like throwing things or breaking my brother's Xbox for an example. He will go sober until the next stressful situation or family party ( my father side of the family are all alcoholics)
  So we are always caught in a needless cycle. And with every cycle his violent behavior is getting worse, so worse that he shoved my mother and somewhat slapped me from the last cycle.
  Right now, I see my father going back to his abusive drinking. Is there anyway I could stop this or at least help him drink less? I understand this is how he copes but I just want this to stop.

She’s going through a tough time deciding what she wants to do out of college and I fear the stress has turned her to drinking, nearly daily.

 It all started around Christmas. A few days in a row she got very drunk and that resulted in her berating me, at one point hitting and biting me, and throwing things, breaking a few appliances. More than once she has said she will get better, and in a way she has. She hasn’t drank to that point since, but I’m scarred from it. She drinks until she’s goofy and acting funny but it causes my anxiety to go haywire. I’ll start acting distant and irritated with her and when she notices she knows why I’m acting like that. She denies her drinking problem, but it’s gotten to the point that she hides her alcohol throughout the house, denies drinking when I can clearly smell it on her, and has been running errands after drinking. 

I’m worried about my wife, but mostly I’m worried about my daughter. My wife stays home with her 5 days out of the week and I’m afraid of what might happen if she drinks too much around her. I also don’t want my daughter to grow up thinking that this is her mom. 

Last of all, I love my wife and want to help her all I can, but I’m hurting. I find myself thinking about leaving and sharing custody of our daughter but then I go back to worrying about what might happen if I’m not there. I’ve discussed it with her but she just says “I know I’m getting better it’s not a problem” or “I think you’re just projecting your insecurities (I’ve dealt with alcoholism before) on me.” If I stay what can I do? How do I survive this?",3.6132139577594096,4.869975757575759,4.41146005509642,87.38062442607901,72.4159779614325,6.58989898989899,28.595959595959602,6.775458762138228,1.3480626262626263,1412,55,286,11,27,454,167,363,0.146,0.758,0.096,-0.952,0,0,9,0,0,0,34.0,1,1,0,4,15,16,0,5,11,0,20,13,0,3,4,66,56,34,0,10,17,13,0,1,0,4,2,2,1,0,19,24,11,0,8,8,0,9,4,10,0,1,5,3,56,6,42,46,8,46,0,1,0,2,49,16,0,10,17,197,75,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17024336605234144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369611823098592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06093207217320646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14181086708585475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061245973890776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777632819894641,0.0,0.0,0.14088799753877446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08182254456443333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10273538919403764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5461870987097893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962845312829802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07279870502950027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322773002384874,0.0,0.13580088116590833,0.0,0.06370342317852916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14086855680681226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05338775125940407,0.0,0.07989549695530912,0.0,0.0,0.09190546659816437,0.08526702859428707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08754717168265486,0.06492542356235502,0.0,0.08433790506894177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03891299238630596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14377456430690538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534883562207779,0.0,0.09328517886870978,0.0,0.0,0.05855195326160965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09068211272171,0.08357933154860313,0.08482470644730365,0.05397293695347968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2258851344373321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22864302988822002,0.0,0.0,0.08922628760378208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07576543963395463,0.0633409186903952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588734653324761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16913015141062926,0.25468907465888146,0.0,0.0,0.09123886606298556,0.08326752878421212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052915955688407366,0.15310961259802594,0.0,0.0,0.046444586158645385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08663638506362935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06571963496506324,0.1409389939306179,0.06322250429305773,0.06389046772197511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187178363461931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426654839474724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0512920223993795
alcoholism,Redditburner28,2019/02/03,"Any advice for my dad..end of the road possibly My dad is 60yrs old, he’s been drinking since at least the mid to late 90s..

So fast forward to the few years..

He missed 24 weeks of work the past year, yet somehow kept his job..

What he would usually do is 

check in at the the hospital, 

Get placed in detox for a few days

Be released and eventually start drinking again after a few days-couple of weeks


This past December, his insurance finally approved for him to go to one of In patient treatment facilities.. The ones where you don’t leave and have group, and all sorts of therapy sessions all day long 

So the insurance ended up only covering him for 3 weeks in there..

The facility suggested he do the program where go goes somewhere for after that and they described it as he’d be there for 6 hours a day and it would help him adjust 

Well the insurance denied that, so after 3 weeks of in patient he came back home ..

He was approved for some shot that was suppose to make him pretty sick if he did drink..

Well it’s about 2 weeks after he came back from the inpatient program and yesterday I had a feeling he started drinking again 

He was sleeping all day 

When he drinks he snores a lot 

Then when he got up he was yelling &amp; complaining which is another thing he does when drinking


So today yup sure enough he’s drinking again..



My question is, is there any hope for him?

I felt like this in patient program was it, this was what he needed but it seems to not matter, all that time there and 2 weeks later it’s all gone- drinking again ..

I know there’s nothing I can do but I live at home currently and I have to deal with his constant yelling, complaining, and general negative attitude when he drinks ( so does my mom).. Any tips on anything I can do possibly ?

My mom told me that his work made him sign some agreement that if he were to miss two more days of work he would be fired so maybe that’ll keep him going to work?

I thought this shot was suppose to keep him from drinking, maybe my parents lied and he didn’t get it..


But yeah impatient seemed like the last chance and now I just don’t know ...

alcoholism,LongTrucPhuc,2019/02/03,"What changes did you notice after you stopped or cut down on drinking? Hi all,

Posting from a dummy account. I'm a 25-year old guy who's been dependent on alcohol for the past four or five years. I get drunk several times per week, often to the point of passing out and waking up to ridiculous mounds of texts and electronic messages. I've broken bones, lost friends and struggled with ever-more-severe hangovers. 

I've tried to stop several times before; I'm often successful for a few days or weeks. It's a strange feeling: I used to smoke, and I never psychological nicotine urges the same as I do for booze. 

Staying away from drinks doesn't seem to impact my body. I've never had withdrawal symptoms, just intense cravings. But whenever I manage to go four or five or six days without drinking at all, it's as if my mind goes into over-drive. I start thinking faster and better; I'll get organized and clean my room and read through school assignments and start going to the gym. For a few days or weeks, I'll feel like me on super-powers. Does anyone else feel the same way? 

But the difficult part is that any return to sobriety seems to invite a wave of confusion. I've never been in touch with my emotions, though I know I have them. Being alcohol-free makes me think about a lot of things I'd rather not think about, from a troubled past (I'm a graduate student and former juvenile delinquent, in the legal sense) to friends who died from addiction. Sometimes it gets so intense that I can't fall asleep for hours, a problem I've always had and which drinking always seemed to alleviate. 

I drank with friends last night after staying away for a week. I felt under control until my friend suggested we do shots. On the way home, I convinced my driver to stop at a liquor store so I got more booze to have by myself.

I don't know if I want to abandon drinking entirely, but I know that I need to take a long break. I don't like the person I am when I drink, the choices I make when I do or the way I feel the morning after.

What kinds of struggles did you all have when you stopped?

alcoholism,brokestgirl,2019/02/03,I’m an alcoholic. What now? I’ve recently come to the realization (or acceptance) that I’m an alcoholic. I’m a 24 year old female living in Toronto. I drink heavily to the point of blackout every weekend and sometimes throughout the week. It’s driving me into debt. I don’t like myself when I drink. I don’t like myself when I’m hungover. But I fear that I’ll lose my social life if I stop. What are the next steps when you’ve come to accept that you’re an alcoholic? Going to meetings? Seeing a therapist? How do you stop drinking? I have a difficult time saying no and once I start I can’t stop myself from going too far.,0.4387683823529436,2.8703126562500003,2.9261580882352938,87.49420955882353,90.40625,5.824264705882353,21.591911764705888,7.285733465282438,1.0903238970588238,492,18,97,9,17,169,78,128,0.17,0.767,0.063,-0.9013,1,0,6,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,0,1,6,7,0,1,10,0,6,7,0,1,0,14,16,9,0,1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4,1,0,0,6,5,6,3,2,4,1,6,4,3,0,0,0,2,15,4,8,16,0,25,0,1,1,0,4,4,0,2,17,57,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4691829741166091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521201121515801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4300762295078096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12329884131749093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646746269935985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16633824543333833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1033651749543553,0.14298991632148356,0.0,0.12922203266737795,0.0,0.0,0.16371846135640106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15563561308849586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15356055768851665,0.15584868874235885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13833981270665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1444943607445634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11637646076343425,0.0,0.0,0.11661505449161072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14917650730439908,0.0,0.0,0.14473526934745046,0.0,0.10358111226520314,0.0,0.0,0.36704359220638416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16991350708308808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533277809223093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11738614885501132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09423898730322217

alcoholism,tcrbang,2019/02/03,"A bunch of bills and checks to write When I was newly sober, having a list of amends to make was like having a big pile of bills to pay. And I hate that feeling: a stack of checks to write and a list of people and places I owe. It’s just always on my mind, lingering in the back row like somebody murmuring behind you at the movies. When I stopped drinking my conscious woke up and I start hearing the voices of remorse.

And then there was that one time when I was in high school that I stole a whole bunch of books from the public library. It was way back when shoplifting was easy. Go in with a nearly empty backpack, load it up with Hobbit adventures, and walk out. Just be careful and it was really that easy. I didn’t feel any guilt at the time because for whatever reason in my head, the world owed me.

And then some time later when writing my 8th Step list my sponsor and I came up with a dollar amount that I owed them based on how many books I stole. That particular public library was in a different state so I wrote them a check and stuffed it in an envelope along with a letter saying, “I stole some books from you guys several years ago and here’s a check that I hope is compensation.”

Or something like that. It was short and sweet because the best amends are. If I get wordy I tend to want to justify, and my goal was to “pay the money back.”

In the days after mailing the letter I was kind of nervous because I didn’t know if I’d have charges pressed against me or I’d go to jail or whatever. When I put myself out into the unknown I never know what’s going to happen. My mind goes to all kinds of silly places and because I’m me, I assumed jail was in my future for most of my amends.

alcoholism,gaiaisgood,2019/02/03,"DAE get annoyed when people are dismissive of how damaging alcoholism is? When I was in rehab, other people there downplayed my addiction all the time because it wasn’t heroin or crack. “You never robbed someone or sucked dick for beer”.

No, I didn’t, but I almost died more times than I can count, my life was in total ruin, and I did ALOT of shameful things that I won’t go into detail about here, but they did include stealing and sexual misconduct.

I’m tired of people underestimating how powerful alcohol is. In my mind, it’s a hard drug. Other people just don’t see that because it’s so ingrained in our culture.

alcoholism,insomniaticmeat123,2019/02/03,"Sleepless hell and whiskey. My cycle of abuse. I’m sure many of you have been in this position. 

A lot is required of me right now. I own my own company, am constantly stressed about performance, money, I travel frequently and every night when I lay down, my heart is pounding, my mind is racing. 

Whiskey shuts this all the fuck up. 

The downside? Now, I lay here at 7:45 AM, having got about 90 min of drunk sleep last night. 

Here’s how it goes: 

10 PM: I don’t want to drink anything tonight. 

Midnight: fuck this, I can’t sleep. I’m gonna watch a documentary and pour some whiskey. 

Pour a finger whiskey. Try to sleep, pour another finger. Try to sleep. 

Finally fall asleep, wake up 45 min later, heart pounding, more whiskey, fall asleep, wake up another 30 min later. More whiskey, fall asleep for 30 min. 

Wake up, Now it’s 5, and I’m hammered and I can’t sleep, but it’s too early to continue drinking. So I sit here and hit my head Repeatedly in anger and call myself a piece of shit. Fuck you you piece of shit. I say this over and over. It activates my nervous system and wakes me up more. I’m so angry at myself. 

I am hopeless. Shattered. It’s been weeks since I’ve slept a full night. 

I exercise, I eat well, I go to therapy, I do breathing exercises and meditation, but every once in a while something deep down is yelling out and I crush it with whiskey. This cycle occurs every few months. 

Why do I drink? Because sometimes it’s effective. Sometimes if I drink enough, it’s all fine and I can deal with the hangover. 

Without alcohol I will get absolute zero sleep. None. This happens often. 

I know this is not sustainable, it’s not always like this. I’ll go weeks without drinking no problem. 

It’s just that sometimes when I’m in my hole, and not sleeping well (for a week now - maybe 1-3 hours a night) my anxiety worsens and I’m helpless. 

I feel like hell. I’m making myself actually sick. And I just want some relief. 

I have so much to do this week. So many people to perform in front of. And I look like shit, feel like shit and tonight will be no different than last night. I’ll do it all over again until the cycle ends. 

I just want a little support. I just want to hear that I’m not alone. I know I can beat this, but i just need some company right now.

alcoholism,retrievingsunflower,2019/02/03,"Reluctance anyone? I’m celebrating 110 days sobriety thanks to AA! The only time I’ve shared is during my 90 day anniversary.  I want to share but im very anxious still and I fear forgetting my words, crying, or saying something that no one would relate to. It’s remarkable for me because my life as a drunk I was an open book and was able to openly express my emotions regardless of whether people wanted it or not. 

Am I alone? How have you faced the fear of sharing and speaking up?",2.3583157894736817,4.851722147368419,3.765526315789476,84.98618421052633,80.15789473684211,6.747368421052633,25.28947368421053,7.908726449838941,1.7087684210526308,384,15,72,7,10,126,75,95,0.211,0.62,0.17,-0.8254,0,1,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,0,0,2,6,0,2,4,0,6,3,1,1,0,17,10,9,0,4,5,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,3,5,1,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,1,1,2,2,10,4,9,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,2,4,44,13,1,0.2121358270736761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21970874003027732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396531025307329,0.0,0.14833030269357164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12931603121055266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2330212449093969,0.2736201178068285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23862425275616184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4774235654568775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22914309593026266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14983780826387005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437487265434793,0.16133885569600534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470682721012705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16869892419762714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16331252370012178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694119455280567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19530616822222052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236981067177918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17503427399685156,0.2502464141156249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15069520507891934,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,butt-chug,2019/02/03,"How to help a good friend. I have a life long friend that is deep in the middle of alcohol abuse. He had a horrible 2018 and has since kind of gone into a tailspin.  He gets very angry when he’s drunk(which is all the time) but he will sometimes open up with me and be vulnerable. I know he’s going through a lot of pain and I want to help in some way. He’s lost a lot of weight and looked pretty rough the last time I saw him. He’s very against AA or the like. He doesn’t like it when people close to him suggest quitting drinking. He shuts the conversation down or leaves the room. I’m very worried about my friend’s health. I want to help him overcome this but I’m not sure what to do. I welcome any advice. Or a point in the right direction if this is the wrong subreddit for this post.  Thanks in advance. Peace and love.

alcoholism,Kyle2378,2019/02/03,"I feel like I’m in too deep I don’t feel like I can stop and I can’t find the willpower to try. I’ve been drinking heavily for about a year now but the last couple of months i feel like I’ve lost control.

I went from eating healthy and going to the gym 6 days a week to eating garbage and drinking all day long. I will start my morning with a couple of tall boys before work. I work as a line cook in a what is basically a brew pub. Drinks are easy to come by and I’m often fed shots or beers throughout the day and have no desire to resist. The moment I get a few beers in my system I feel content. I like how it makes me feel. I love it. I love being completely numb. Lately it has gotten to about 20 drinks a day that are spaced out to the point where I am able to function but I have this constant haze over me. As my shift comes to an end, I will often have 3-5 shots all for free and it feels like water every time I down them but with the taste comes an instant wave of relief that washes over me.

I have recently been mixing Xanax with my alcohol at the end of the night. Nothing major but what is considered to be light doses. Usually .25mg but can be up to 2mg. I know what I am doing is dangerous. I don’t mind. The feeling of complete numbness is what I look forward to at the end of my day. 

I didn’t have a troubled childhood, I have a support system and I have people who love me. I still have aspirations and I am earning money. I have found away to balance this with my life but as of recently I feel like I’m wasting away. I feel nothing. 

I want to be in the gym again. I want to be eating right. I want to feel okay again but it feels so far away that i will never reach it. I am drunk and want to give up. 
Maybe someone will see this. Maybe not. I can’t fix it.

alcoholism,midnight_wandering,2019/02/04,"I need help before my mom kills herself or someone else Hello reddit! 

I have been a long time lurker and signed up today because i need help and maybe the community can help. I don’t know where else to turn too. 

Since as long as i can remember, my mom has had a drinking problem. From what I know she drank when pregnant with me and my sibling. Her parents did the same. She has gone through some trauma in her life, and she seems to be in a never ending cycle. Recently I’ve begun to notice not only is her memory failing. But she has regressed her personality into a child’s. It always seemed i was the parent but it’s even more so. 

My paw tried to intervene several times for her. But the times between when she was not drinking and was drinking have decreased. My sibling also has seen it as a problem but they have a very codependent relationship. I’ve told her many times she needs help and she lashes out at me and attacks me. 

I don’t know what else to do anymore. She will either kill someone driving drunk, die in her sleep from this (and mixing pills) or.. god i don’t know. She is a class a narcissist. Has an eating disorder. Body dysmorphia. And severe untreated depression. She says at her age (50+) i don’t need to parent her and she doesn’t need help. 

Not only is she hurting the rest of us, she’s really hurting herself and she flies into these drunken rages. I’m in Canada and i don’t think i can check her into a hospital without her consent. Her side of the family enables this behaviour. And she’s hanging around people in their twenties and I think it’s because mentally that’s how she functions. 

She’s violently assaulted others. She is extremely mentally abusive to others. And if you tell her she’s wrong in any way she shuts you out. I told her recently I had to distance myself away from her because I couldn’t do it anymore and she always tries and guilts her way back in. But no matter what I do. She won’t accept help. Or listen. And thinks it’s fine. I don’t want to abandon her (she had abandonment issues, which maybe that’s why she tends to abandon others) but I can’t keep getting sucked down and watching her destroy her life and others. 

What can I do? She’s currently seeing a therapist for childhood traumas from having alcoholic parents but refuses to admit she is one.  (The last time I saw her I couldn’t drink water out of her water jug in the fridge and found out later it when I went and poured myself a glass anyways that the water she was drinking was straight vodka. I knew she was drinking long before that as she was drunk when i got there but couldn’t find any wine.) 

Is there a way to check her into a hospital or rehab? Is there a way I can help her? I don’t know what to do.

alcoholism,Pregsthrow,2019/02/04,"Pregnant and I failed Short version: I’m almost 20 weeks pregnant. Stay at home mom to a wonderful 2 year old son. 

I was a secret alcoholic for many years. I sobered up when I was pregnant with my first no problem. I was even sober for months after. This time is different. There’s more stress. I’m more alone with husband traveling. 

Long story short - I just took a large shot of liqueur. I drank alcohol while I felt my child kicking me. 

Is this my low? I feel like I’ve had many but never while I actively feel this child inside of me. I’m terrified of hurting her/him. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m so ashamed. 

I really don’t need people making me feel worse but I know I deserve it.

alcoholism,everythingisfine2,2019/02/04,"Some day 2 thoughts Day 2 almost over. Just checking in. 
Having a more difficult time today. Not about wanting to drink today, more about wanting to drink eventually. My addiction keeps telling me if I can make it Monday to Friday then I can continue to have some drinks on the weekend. 
Logically, I know I can't do that or I will end up in the exact same situation (drinking every night). This addiction is sneaky and strong. 
But for today, I will not drink with you.

alcoholism,Sorta__Rican,2019/02/04,"Heartbroken from my partner’s alcoholism TL;DR: my boyfriend is a stubborn alcoholic and I couldn’t handle him when he drank anymore, so I left. It was the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make, and just need to vent. 

   A few weeks ago I made the decision to start moving of the house I shared with my boyfriend for three years. We began dating 3.5 years ago. 
   When the relationship began I noticed he enjoyed drinking quite a bit, but didn’t fully realize how bad it was until about a year and a half in. He seemed to function well, and it was more of an inconvenience than a potentially serious problem at the time. 
   However, throughout the years I learned more and more about what it was really doing to him. It was affecting his finances, his work, and he only ever went to bars. It began to get worse around October 2017. He began to show extreme amounts of anger when he drank. Anger he had never shown before. He would be within an inch or so of my face screaming at me, would break mirrors, throw glassware, threw my art in the trash, etc. if I ever had anything to say about his drinking. If I ever got upset, or frustrated or sad about anything, a tantrum would no doubt ensue. It was terrible. I’m no doctor, but I worry if maybe alcohol has taken its toll on his physical and mental health as well? Where could all of this insane and sudden rage be coming from? I could never figure it out. 
   His anger, constant broken promises, and neglect began to be too overwhelming, and now, within a little over a year, I feel I have no other choice.  He was not the same person he was when I had first met him, and it breaks my heart knowing things have only gotten worse. 
   I tried my best to get him to make better decisions, to help steer him onto the right path, help him have hobbies that didn’t involve drinking. I myself chose not to drink for 3 years because I wanted to help lead by example. How an you ask someone to curb their drinking when you, too, indulge in it? But when he has friends who are also heavy drinkers, and parents who enabled his drinking, it made things significantly more difficult to do. His mother claimed it was ‘my job to to get him to stop’ yet in the same breath would gift him wine almost every time we saw them. I felt like I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone. Nothing made sense, and it felt like everyone rejected reality. 
   I don’t know if he’ll ever get the help that he needs, or will ever choose to accept that help when it’s offered to him again, but I’ll always hold out hope. He was everything I could have ever asked for when he was sober, and there was no doubt in my mind he was the person I could have spent the rest of my life with, if only he just didn’t drink. 
   I’m not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I just had to vent. I’m still wondering if I made the right decision or not, but hindsight, I’m sure, will let me know eventually. 

Also I’m sorry if the format is strange. I’m on mobile.

alcoholism,4fgtr32hu,2019/02/04,"The unlucky ones I found out yesterday one of my brother’s best friends is probably homeless. He is a great guy. The type who would gladly give you the shirt off his back. But alcoholism sunk in its claws and his life has slowly spiraled out of control since. One of my best friends from college is also fully an alcoholic. He has been able to maintain his professional life but his personal life is in shambles. His girlfriend even died of alcohol poisoning a few years back. The other brother one of groomsman in his wedding is also suffering from alcoholism. He had so much potential (had a full ride)but now his personal and professional life are a wreck.

It seems so strange. In college all of us were hard boozing. All 3 of us brothers and all our friends had atrocious drinking habits. Yet the lot of us are doing well to very well. In our early to late 30s virtually all of all three groups are middle to upper middle class. Most have a spouse. Many have kids. Basically life is going pretty well for everyone except the 3 unlucky guys who turned into alcoholics. Looking back there wasn’t any obvious sign that these 3 were destined for alcoholism. The one guy I would have predicted would end up an alcoholic went to rehab in his mid 20s and is doing well now. 

I guess it kind of blows my mind that the same decision that just leaves me and almost everyone else in the groups with great memories has left a few of the people in the groups lives in shambles.",4.7936855923859545,6.727229256317695,5.039588119461765,81.35703232687891,70.51624548736463,8.50206760748277,30.641450607154574,9.095868883498916,2.733412996389892,1172,50,213,24,22,369,153,277,0.075,0.8,0.125,0.91,0,0,8,0,0,0,22.0,5,1,0,3,17,15,1,0,19,0,28,17,1,1,6,33,36,11,1,3,4,4,1,0,4,3,14,0,0,6,10,9,9,1,3,1,0,2,1,2,4,6,9,2,21,13,36,24,14,33,0,1,1,0,38,20,0,5,11,158,31,6,0.0750837304660439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5616917141336495,0.07518551023934812,0.0,0.0,0.1200888642533813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05105951144773682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17320426225889554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15759148565212788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842127882168581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07792505803149581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735534711819942,0.0,0.0,0.06272282227052048,0.0,0.0665018991610067,0.0,0.0,0.049592095841294884,0.0,0.0,0.14349144420577095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232543498725138,0.1740285117144573,0.0,0.0,0.07202715596668137,0.04267181432910035,0.0,0.0,0.16556015581533448,0.08271319412296899,0.2230340934260139,0.0,0.0,0.06726027454992517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07818815108464468,0.0,0.0,0.08469771838279815,0.07950282932870915,0.08157869284338704,0.0,0.26516929658939353,0.0,0.0,0.06630030959922728,0.0,0.06305142327074283,0.0,0.0,0.06383350262262008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07612311783507565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07581316380515182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055195181137295914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.254393394730045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052053604781824483,0.13112043465691464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638714697232192,0.0809529606823214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06835340826858549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062110037735373276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816695379110924,0.0,0.0,0.2709494488042671,0.0,0.0,0.06195194103886518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27003716353000523,0.06960337037372898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16001198359682692,0.0,0.0,0.04835146070333097

alcoholism,amstr,2019/02/05,Feeling embarrassed I have not had a drink in 35 days. Really proud of myself. My husband announced this afternoon that he is going to an alanon meeting tonight. I know in my head that he is going to find support for himself and to support me in the best way. But for some reason I’m so embarrassed. Like it’s so bad he needs to go get help. I feels so selfish because I want him to go on one hand and I’m embarrassed at the same time. Thoughts appreciated. ,1.9689247311827955,4.096624387096775,3.6658064516129047,87.18537634408602,79.32258064516128,6.713978494623658,27.53763440860215,7.793537801064563,1.7305827956989257,360,16,74,6,9,120,66,93,0.13,0.621,0.249,0.9071,0,0,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,2,3,10,0,3,4,0,4,3,2,1,0,14,19,6,0,2,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,1,0,6,1,0,4,1,5,0,1,2,3,10,5,13,17,3,14,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,1,5,46,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17616787211939944,0.12861757134426086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22142103216527945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13607112240378205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066899165403786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2133658096856916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19284107610079212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102335887205779,0.0,0.4796420128418013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21653665385498766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14142217776116908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595460928887798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030790770664988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15644644279498626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14297231301314367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351656236978898,0.2169329036525155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4788579989301743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675025256355714,0.12302999030353234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12444739341233095,0.16747407466547198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,bahamut_x3,2019/02/05,"I wrote a poem to my wife (this ended up being really long by the time I contextualized the poem) I started drinking in 2007.  It got progressively worse (as it does).  Back then it was for fun, with friends, and I thought it made playing video games and entertaining myself really fun.  I then started to use it as a coping mechanism to deal with my ex-wife.  We divorced but I didnt stop drinking.

In the meantime (2013) I met and manage to woo the girl of my dreams.  Beautiful, smart, argumentative about religion, politics etc and never takes losing or winning a debate too far (we’ve only ever had 1 real argument in which we ended up upset)... I have, however, hurt her in drunken tirades.  She has always been stone cold when I get hostile, patiently waits out my fits, and then holds me while I sob myself to sleep.  A perfect angel whose love I’ve basically been abusing because I won’t stop drinking.  The awful things I have said in my angry drunkenness should have left me out in the streets alone.  But she never gave up on me.

I hit the lowest point in my life last February when I lost my job (actually for reasons not related to alcohol).  I could barely hold myself together, and my wife was there to glue me back together again.  Every hangover, every drunken fit, outrage, tantrum.  I was killing 15-20 beers a night, rapidly drinking right through our savings.  Didnt get another job until August.

In June she went into the hospital with chest pains caused by stress.

I was doing this to her, and even after a hospital visit, I didn’t see it.

I found Reddit in December of last year.  I started off on the typical funny subs or entertaining subs.  Then I don’t know how, but I stumbled onto some of the many support subs for alcoholics.

And it scared me shitless.  The consequences of drinking are all over the place.  I kind of had a wakeup call when I realized that thanks to my wife, I have probably been saved from DUIs and PI citations or worse.

I have been tapering down my drinking.  Around 6 a night.  I dont have insurance and live in the US, otherwise I would have checked into rehab already.  I looked at TSM and other alternatives... but right now I think my best bet is to taper out and then quit cold once I go a few days and make sure I dont get hit by DTs.  Regardless, I’m determined to quit and this is my first (semi) public acknowledgement of my intent to quit.  I am looking into my local AA resources, but I’m an agnostic bordering on atheism so I hope they’ll be open-minded about me clinging to an unconventional higher power on my journey through the steps.

Anyway, I wrote this poem for my wife to thank her for not giving up on me.  When we were dating I wrote her all kinds of poetry and I kept writing after we got married, but the worse my drinking got, even the poems stopped.  Here it is:

———————————
How all of it hurts you

Sick. Sad.
Can’t focus, blurry vision
I passed out in the floor again
Never bad enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Quiet. Sober.
Can’t stop shaking, still can’t focus
Your worry and concern showing again
Never bad enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Angry. Confused.
Can’t laugh, can’t cry
I diagnosed all of humanities problems again
Don’t care enough to see
How all of it hurts me

Awake. Anxious.
Can’t sleep, can’t rest
I drank a few beers less again
Starting to care and see
How all of it hurts me

Trapped. Concerned.
Can’t help, can’t stop it
The fear is in your eyes again
That’s when I knew
How all of it hurts you

Improving. Striving.
Can help, can stop
The color of our laughter painting happiness again
I’ll do what I need to do
So none of it hurts you

Clean. Sober.
You helped, I stopped.
Our lives are much better again
Thanks to you I could finally see
How all of it was hurting me
————————————

I’m in the next to last stanza for now.
I’ll be counting days soon.  Then hopefully months and years.

Thank you all for these subreddits that helped open my eyes to how awful I was and the direction alcohol was taking me.

alcoholism,elleebee,2019/02/05,"My alcoholic mom got drunk and got severely injured falling down the stairs Hi all, looking for a bit of advice from you. My mom is a heavy drinker, daughter of an alcoholic, married to reformed alcoholic (after a run in with the law). I'm at a place now where I don't trust her with my children because she is unsteady and can't remember doing things. She seems aware that we think she drinks too much. On the weekend, she presumably got drunk and fell down the stairs, resulting in an ambulance ride to the hospital for broken bones, a concussion, and a head laceration requiring staples. She's going to be OK, but I want to tell her that I'm worried about her drinking and wish she would stop. I'd appreciate some advice about the right time and approach to telling her how I feel. I don't want a confrontation, I don't want to hurt her feelings. I don't know how to do that.",6.141676300578034,6.110315335260117,6.435612716763008,79.73561560693645,66.16763005780346,10.15699421965318,35.21907514450867,9.888512548439397,3.299120693641618,695,31,138,14,10,224,102,173,0.105,0.7809999999999999,0.114,0.5381,0,0,6,0,0,0,20.0,1,1,0,1,7,4,1,0,15,1,11,10,2,3,1,30,27,9,0,5,1,3,2,0,0,1,4,0,0,1,4,9,7,2,7,5,0,6,5,2,0,0,3,3,22,2,23,22,4,22,0,1,1,0,20,11,0,2,5,90,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710696009922569,0.0,0.4446803064192862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454946268175538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15142309807745044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2717439180755556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14026049765235188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882568851503098,0.0,0.33279015089817304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14234491868409396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1484798665267311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07622519853532425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11647200685768765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248845687646323,0.0,0.0,0.1019595305300188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14491065957798516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15711863124691608,0.11844796350730513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262661209473316,0.0,0.15669009371311113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595835459778432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24245761895473145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214527780877264,0.08887255021979099,0.0,0.0,0.0808763488937501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2454243258176819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1594967024863334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14085529995658602,0.0,0.09852760325898276,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,BonnieZoom,2019/02/05,"Concerned I'm developing a dependence... So I have a history of mental health problems (who doesn't!) -Alcoholism runs in my family and has been a major issue for my mother and my grandparents, and also my extended family. 

I remember my mum would be very cautious about my alcohol consumption as a teen/young adult. (I live in the UK, so alcohol is treated differently in the UK than in places like America. It's pretty much accepted that young people in their teens drink/get drunk- and drinking culture is huge here) As it's so normal here for teens to drink, I always wondered why she was so strict with me, but now I understand. 

After a horrible experience at 14 which included a copious amount of alcohol, which put me off it for many, many years, I feel that now in my mid twenties, I have really 'discovered' drinking. 

Over the course of about a year, I've gone from drinking every month or two, to drinking 5/6 nights a week until I fall asleep. 

I am incredibly antisocial, and incredibly depressed, so I tend to drink alone in secret. I also have horrendous sleeping problems which Doctors won't even attempt to treat (sometimes not sleeping for 3 days at a time, sometimes sleeping for 20+ hours, and constantly exhausted) Without going into detail, my mental health issues have been treated by various doctors/therapists/psychologists/psychaitrists/months of hospitalisations (I feel like everyone goes through this shit at some point though so whatever) -but I feel that now there's nothing that can be done for me. I've tried it all. 

I know I'm not an 'alcoholic,' (I feel like people throw that term around far too much) but I do feel like I may be beginning to develop a psychological dependency. I find myself thinking that drinking non-alcoholic liquid is almost kind of pointless (does that make sense?) 

Is this a normal phase that everyone goes through? Is it the beginning of an 'issue?' If anyone has any thoughts or advice that'd be great.

alcoholism,ahNatahilation,2019/02/05,"Alcohol is my crutch for confrontation I've never learned to argue properly or stand up for myself. My older sibling was a bully, so I quickly learned to avoid disagreements and hide from confrontation. My parents divorced  early. I never saw them argue. Furthermore, my mom is a doormat and I've only witnessed her lose an argument to said older sibling. As a young adult I was in an abusive relationship, and I learned that confrontation can be physically dangerous. 

Fast-forward 20 years, and no surprize, I've developed an alcohol problem and an avoidance problem. When I've had any problems at work, I ghost that job. I don't even pick up my last paycheck, or show up to the last few scheduled shifts. I've left friends and cities behind. Left classes without properly dropping the class and getting fails on my college record.

I got sent home from work yesterday for acting funny. I told the supervisor I skipped my mental medication and blurted out that I have PTSD. I do have PTSD and I've been out of 1 medication for about 6 weeks. But truthfully, I was drinking on the job. I could possibly salvage my job with lies. I just don't have the courage to have a sober conversation. I've tried it a couple times in the last 10 years. I just start shaking and crying uncontrollably. I mean I become a blubbering mess. 

Last night I tried a couple of times to call my boss. Sitting there staring at my phone, thinking what I could possibly say. Instead I induced a panic attack. So I start doing shots right away to calm myself down. Alcohol alleviates boredom and loneliness, yes, but for me, I need it the most for uncomfortable conversations. How do I get past that part? I feel like I missed the normal part of growing up by not learning how to argue, admit wrong, or stand up for myself.

alcoholism,TRNEYN,2019/02/05,Please help. My brother has been hardcore alcoholic for many years and now trying to quit but he is hearing voices in his head. I don’t know if this is right but I read something called DTs? I think it sounds like what my brother is going through. He hears voices in his head and I don’t know how to help him. Does it eventually stop and if so roughly how long does it take? He has been an alcoholic for 10+ years and just got out of jail where he was sober for 30 days after he was drunk and was arrested for trespassing and now he said he is hearing voices in his head and he tells me that the voices are talking to him about me and my mom and I’m desperate for help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,Doctor_Diseased,2019/02/06,"RUQ Abdominal Pain - Kind of scared - blood levels normal LONG TL;DR: Should I be worried about my liver-area pain if ALT, AST, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, creatine, and urea nitrogen are all within normal ranges? My doctor suspects gallstones or liver sludge. The pain I have in my liver / gallbladder area is more of a dull ache with pain level of a 2-3/10 most of the day. It kind of feels like I was punched in the lower ribs near my sternum with a phantom bruise. It's still alarming because this is new to me. I also have a recent change to slightly lighter / yellow stool, but from what I understand this can also be related to gallbladder function.  


I've been having on and off upper-right abdominal pain for the past 3 weeks intermittently, but it's been consistent the past few days. The pain isn't worsened with alcohol, but instead just generally when I eat. I have an ultrasound scan due tomorrow. I'm awaiting lipase + amylase levels that should come back in a couple days, however:   


All of these are within normal range:  
ALT  
AST  
Bilirubin  
Total protein  
Albumin  
Creatine  
Urea nitrogen (lowest of normal ref range, but I'm on a low protein vegan diet)  


The only three things that are on the low end:  
WBC (has been all over the place the past few years)  
B12 is borderline low  
High vitamin D and borderline high calcium (stupidly took too much D3 for a long time)

I'm obviously on a pretty rapid taper now. I was previously drinking a daily 2-4 beers equivalent for about 3 years on and off until I had a bout of sciatica 4 months ago, and my intake increased to 10 beers equivalent per day (170ish ml). I'm able to tolerate a drop to 3 beers equivalent without major symptoms, so I figure I can be back off permanently in less than a week.   


Thoughts? Am I going to die? Should I be seriously worried? I've been unable to do anything the past few days because I'm afraid of finding out I've totally irreversibly ruined my body because of chronic pain aversion.

alcoholism,speedandanal,2019/02/06,"Getting drunk is the only thing i look forward to in life. Sup guys, so not too long ago I got busted by the pigs.

What it ends up is basically I won't be able to get the job I've wanted, I've been going to collage for 3 years for that shit, and have 2 more years ahead of me. And I'm looking at a super high fine.

I got all my drugs(even legal one's ) confiscated, the pigs took my PC , for who knows how long, and even my fucking vape. The fucking assholes.

So basically I still go to my job, and work my ass off . But I'm going from deep depression to anger to a moment of relief, brought on by the booze.
Like my last 2 days were shit, since I couldn't get wasted , but today was good since I got drunk and don't give a damn about the fucks .

So guys , is there anything I can look forward to , or am I , like alot of my family members and friends, will just live this sad pathetic life , waiting for my next glass . Is there anything you would recommend for a fucked guy like me.

Like fuck I had it all, the brains , the fizique heck even the mental strength, but this shit has got me fucking destroyed.",4.148833437305052,4.1124362882096115,4.856534622582657,89.37747816593887,70.39737991266375,7.76556456643793,27.274173424828447,7.1686216300943375,1.0828400499064257,846,25,195,7,14,273,136,229,0.2,0.654,0.145,-0.9619,2,0,1,0,0,0,32.0,0,1,0,4,12,24,12,0,15,0,18,16,5,1,2,21,45,14,0,3,6,0,0,4,1,3,2,0,0,3,8,6,3,1,1,2,0,7,4,14,0,1,10,3,22,10,25,30,4,27,0,2,3,7,7,9,12,2,19,114,30,5,0.0937978926328201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314617237800166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543753470768103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10470946900379212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060491881042118535,0.0,0.08078798748124949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307709218315558,0.0,0.0,0.1858578703649509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08842430537555528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246801917238396,0.5202878417996193,0.14701658260619324,0.0899794855699867,0.1599225118695469,0.07867322212953584,0.30007497335611144,0.0,0.0,0.2786239817704929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910262342823403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861598703716187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05154886876418666,0.07645780153371094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325044509995981,0.18329964970332904,0.0,0.08282525765183545,0.16601636666499814,0.2362998186259633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09452621427408972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09975512292889548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06355987955654019,0.07133752404217934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28884656662696145,0.15518117213309265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490711822024748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06231515200059079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890943471620083,0.0,0.1042129099871172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0553244272944368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06828598296420263,0.0,0.0,0.06663133173334343,0.0,0.0,0.12080553514165365

I am on vacation and got very drunk for 5 or 6 days in a row before deciding it was time to take a night off. I am now laying in bed at 130am unable to sleep and shaking and i just feel very off. Im wondering if these symptoms are dangerous and how to make them leave. Should i taper off by drinking a little bit?",1.4929945054945082,3.1144942747252737,3.7583379120879137,88.37728708791211,78.78021978021978,7.187362637362638,24.561813186813183,8.07648339933343,1.3898670329670328,333,12,73,6,8,115,69,91,0.132,0.868,0.0,-0.8553,0,0,2,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,0,3,3,1,1,6,0,7,5,1,2,1,16,14,8,0,3,3,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,1,2,2,5,3,0,3,2,0,1,1,3,0,0,3,1,5,0,14,10,1,19,0,0,0,0,4,10,0,3,8,45,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21388408248853014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1703006479185363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21849623155558892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12907089989111847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19605668752494496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10119456860364624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456258641103834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16006671547752666,0.0,0.0,0.3963314022623384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21618078255807105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21191469439260746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20058844046604152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13359206158882822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15435690634553234,0.0,0.0,0.18781369532498954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21000863713868964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910520681644441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19150273242758534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20028012730688816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20801751040472785,0.15047705783385018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167006730123888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3302656462199421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21703851206831865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888075940062793

alcoholism,valdez576,2019/02/07,"I want to quit - will tapering help? I didn’t drink much last week. 

I drank some this week. Over the past 1:5 years, I drank about 5-6 drinks each night. 

When I say quit, I don’t want to quit entirely - I just want to break the bad habit of daily drinking and reserve this activity for the weekend. I know I am in a different position than many of you, but I feel in control of my situation. To me, this is a bad habit that needs to be broken. 

So here’s how my week went:

Sunday - 3 drinks

Monday - 5 drinks

Tuesday - 4 drinks

Wednesday - 3 drinks

Thursday (today) - 5 drinks (I went out with a friend)


Next week I’m going to nail it to a T and taper fully. 

Is it likely I’ll feel withdrawal symptoms when I hit 0 drinks? I’m going to do this... Sunday 4 Monday 2 Tuesday 0... Wednesday 0... etc. 

For example, Wednesday of this week I drank 3, only to stick to the script and attempt to avoid withdrawal. I really had no desire to drink that day. 

Any advice and insight is appreciated. 

I’m 22yo, healthy, white, male, 5 feet 11 inches, 185 pounds

alcoholism,bobmonk2019,2019/02/07,"At risk drinking for 1.5 years Hi, I am 20 years old and started binge drinking on weekends with friends when i turned 18. Around 1.5 years ago i started to drink around 25-35 units weekly spread over 3-5 nights a week with over the last 6 months its increased to between 35-45 units/week sometimes more than that if i have a F*** it week and don’t take any days off.
I haven’t gone much more than about a week at a time without a drink in the last year although never experienced any withdrawals when i do stop for 3-6 days.   

I have recently thought alot more about my relationship with booze and the potential damage i might have already done and could do if i carry on with this bad habit and have scared myself silly reading about alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis, Although I have never experienced any symptoms of these i do worry. So I have taken the last 3 weeks off drink with some cravings on Friday and Saturday night.

I know no one on here is a medical professional, but I would like to know if anyone has developed liver or other problems from this type of drinking over a year and a half as I plan on cleaning up my act and joining the military however I worry about damage i might have done affecting my medical checks. I must stress I have never experienced any withdrawal or symptoms relating to my alcohol use. Am I being paranoid?  Any anecdotes or advice is very much welcome.

My understanding is that there is a religious component to AA, and I'm not religious. Not interested in finding religion or participating in religious groups, so I'm looking into what else is out there.

I'm in central Illinois, so if anyone knows anything specifically in that area, that would be great. Basically what I'm looking for is just someone or some group I can talk to about my alcoholism on the DL because most of my friends and family have no idea how bad my drinking has been over the years, and I'd rather just confide in someone else and remain a closeted alcoholic. 

I'm thinking about just seeing a psychiatrist about it, but even with health insurance I assume it would be expensive. Is this the best route? Where do I go to find a support group? The hospital?

alcoholism,doctorwho2x,2019/02/08,"Looking for similar experience Hello friends.

I'm hoping to find similar experiences to hopefully help my current condition.

Food and alcohol go hand and hand with me. I'm overweight but I drink because it depresses me. I drink at night.. I start the day doing perfect keto ..even dinner is keto.. then I drink and I eat crap... Obviously waking up the next day feeling like crap. 

Was wondering how this was overcome..

alcoholism,LionVenom10,2019/02/08,"Alcohol is my valentine. It is the one thing that loves me back, all my friends let me down, they never invite me when they’re out, and if I ask them to go out they either refuse or agree but never come anyway. My friends from back home rarely wanna call. 

Alcohol is the only friend that makes me happy, the only one that never lets me down, without alcohol I’m always lonely, but it’s warmth is really what gets me through the day. Call me a sad loser all you want, but as long as I have a drink by my side your words will never hurt me.",4.1483928571428565,4.294434910714287,4.978571428571431,87.86642857142859,70.42857142857143,7.828571428571429,23.142857142857146,7.447530270364453,0.7316285714285717,418,8,92,4,7,136,72,112,0.11,0.6759999999999999,0.214,0.9318,0,2,4,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,3,1,4,9,0,0,6,0,8,5,0,1,6,22,16,9,0,3,7,0,0,0,3,1,3,0,1,0,7,4,4,1,0,1,0,2,5,4,0,2,0,0,19,5,12,13,3,16,0,4,0,1,13,5,0,2,9,71,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4455698387039456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11563932153019145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992397533308067,0.0,0.0,0.2137282201010131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28382045274604545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11971568013194825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962814401884073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361437554101363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32211797420980315,0.0,0.07260932217670163,0.0,0.07898337032324784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14794273633152208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13940444794621729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487768835814349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842251362208873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12298955301600592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12543143562348288,0.0,0.09276768462882046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4287480150494268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18834772338282185,0.21139530689575126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08903170469367845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232960393769396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08197175640567589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13396808581333636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,masked_fragments,2019/02/08,"Looking for assurance. Hi everyone!

Recently I broke up with someone and a lot of that decision came from him turning to alcohol and party life style. I strongly believe he’s an alcoholic, but then wonder if I was just “overreacting”. So I wanted to get your opinions. I still worry about him but know there’s nothing I can do and there’s no getting back together. I just want to ease my mind.

First my ex has always had mental and emotional issues since I met him when he was 18. He used to socially smoke but quit because I will not date a smoker. I mention this because he occasionally say how he wanted a smoke when stressed.

Once he turned 21 he started mentioning buying alcohol often. We were on an extremely tight budget so I often said no. When we did splurge he would drink most of it in that day/night making himself sick.

The last 3 months of our relationship he had some traumatic events happen and met some new friends (that like to party and encouraged him to drink to forget his problems). He started to want to hang out with them more and more and constantly asked if we could buy beer.

He was severely depressed and suicidal at the time and I told him drinking was not good in that state. But he didn’t care and said it was me causing his stress/problems.

Now he’s with someone that supports his drinking lifestyle. He post about drinking often as well as angry and depressed post.

I’m pretty certain he has an addictive and avoidant personality and is using alcohol to run away from his problems. I’m sad that the new people in his life are encouraging this too.

alcoholism,Allien24,2019/02/09,"I NEED HELP WITH A DUI SITUATION. I did qualify for a Public Defender but still want to hear other peoples input. Hi everyone. This is my first time posting. I know many people are going to express thier anger at me for putting other people in danger by driving drunk and I completely agree. I feel ashamed and disgusted with myself for doing this.  I am making this post because I need advice and insight into other people experiences. 

This happened in the state of Oregon. 
Prior to this I had a clean reccord not even a parking ticket. 

Okay so this is my current situation:
I got in a bad car accident. No one was seriously ingured (my car was totaled). I dont remember much except waking up in the jail. I am out on bail and my PD said they are wanting me to serve 30 days in jail plus a bunch of ther stuff like suspended license, classes and fines. I am concerned about jailtime. PD adviced I go to a infacility rehab situation for 30 days ASAP and she would try to convince judge to let me sub the jail for rehab. I have court in a few weeks and not sure how to prepare.

My health insurance needs me to do a drug and alcohol assesement to see if I qualify for in-facility vs out-patient treatment. I have that appointment scheduled. I have no expereince with D&amp;A Evaluations.  What qualifies someone as a ""Level 3"" category? (Which is what I would need to be assesed at to be placed into a resdiential rehab.) I dont want to score too high and be placed for more than 30 days at the same time Im affraid if I dont get in, I will face jailtime.

I am not looking to lie on the assesement. I just want to know what to expect... I'm not physically addicted to alcohol but I am deffinetly psychologically dependant. I tried to stop on my own time and time again just to fail. I always drink to get drunk even if I dont intend to at first.  If someone is drinking around me, so am I. I cant say no to alcohol.
However, this was the first time in YEARS that I was able to stop for more than a week or 2. It's been 40 days since I drank and I can't even believe it myself. I had mild ""withdrawls"" if you will mostly anxiety, feelings of depression and a few days of random spouts of nausea when I woukd wake up, but mostly intense sugar cravings. Even though I am proud of being sober so long I want to go to rehab because Im affraid once all of this is over I will fall back into my old ways. I dont know what to do.

alcoholism,Vokazyr,2019/02/09,"Long-term health impacts of drinking I’m 38 and recently quit drinking after about 8 years of heavier drinking preceded by 7 years of lighter drinking. Lighter was 2-3 beers 4-5 nights a week. Heavier was 3-6 beers 6 nights per week. Occasionally the bigger binge. 
Keep in mind that I’m very tall, and have weighed between 225-245 during this time. I’ve always been a runner and occasional lifter. When I drank my bac didn’t go as high as someone that was lighter. Maybe it would hit .08 after a couple hours but not very often would it go beyond that. I didn’t suffer from hangovers very often and was always very functional. 

I’ve seen my weight, my blood pressure, and my heart arrhythmia (benign PAC/PVC) increase in that time span (age 24-38). 

All of that has me concerned about the long term impacts on our bodies. I’m very worried I’ve done permanent damage do my heart and vascular system.  
I want to know what your experiences have been sobering up. What damage was reversible? What did you discover was permanent damage?

alcoholism,lizziemander,2019/02/09,"Is he drinking again? Hi, everyone. Hopefully you can help me. This is going to be a long one. Sorry for that.

John (not his real name) is my good friend of 30+ years. I'm pretty much adopted into his family. 

Recently (about two weeks ago -- that recently) his wife died very suddenly. She was a young and lovely woman. He had to make the decision to take her off life support. I've been staying with him since then, basically giving him his space, but being at hand when he needs to cry or laugh or watch YouTube channels about subreddits (a favorite.) 

Unfortunately (as you might have guessed,) he has a history of alcoholism. He went to rehab and has been sober for a couple of years. More unfortunately, he doesn't go to meetings. He's adamantly atheist and felt they put too much emphasis on God as a higher power. That's probably accurate for around these parts. I've looked into meetings and organizations that lean away from that, but none of them have meetings anywhere near us.

So, without a sponsor and support group, especially during a time of extraordinary duress... I worry. He's started seeing a grief counselor -- so that's something. I've asked him a couple times whether he's been drinking (it's hard to tell -- he's been taking ativan and a few other drugs that make him super sleepy...)

The answer is 'no,' of course. If I were to pursue the subject, the answer would *still* be no and he'd probably get offended -- because of course he would. Quickest way to deflect and cow someone, right? It'd pretty quickly turn bad and I'd be out on my ass -- not like I've nowhere else to go, but I wouldn't be here for him, and I'm the only one he's letting be around. His family grates on his nerves pretty quick, though they love him and are only trying to help (in a pushy way.)

Here's the kicker: he smells really strongly of mouthwash. I know that sounds dumb, but mouthwash is supposed to wear off after a bit, I mean the strength of it... right? It shouldn't permeate a room. I once had an alcoholic roommate and have an alcoholic cousin. I remember this sickly sweet/sour smell... but I couldn't bet my life on it. 

I'm scared. I want to be wrong -- or to be sure, one way or the other. I want him to get help if he's drinking again. I don't want him to be alone, because I'm scared what he might do. His self-esteem has never been the best. He has anxiety and depression. Since his wife's death, he's been having nightmares and full-blown panic attacks.

I don't know how to tell for sure if he's drinking, in the absence of staggering and slurring. I'm frightfully naive about this sort of thing. I know alcoholics hide their drinking and lie. I can't tell if he's doing that.

alcoholism,PastBox,2019/02/09,"I almost Lost Hope Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

So its been a long battle with my addiction.

I was doing good for 3 months and I slipped up because stress of school.

I graduated in Winter with my bachelors degree in sociology. 

Now, I'm waiting for start work and was abusing my sobriety.

I was also good for two weeks of January. However, I got depressed and lonely and found the outlet of drinking.

My gf of seven years was deeply hurt and is now going to meetings for people who are alcoholics.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I woke up with my gerd acting up and man how do not miss the feeling of feeling ill. My anxiety is little high but I can manage. The body feeling is a reminder of what drinking does to my body. Its not worth it. 

Im not drinking today. Even tho I want to ""feel better"" about the situation I'am in. However, I'm tired of hurting and hurting others because of my selfish reasoning for drinking.

alcoholism,AC8563,2019/02/09,"Quitting for good I'm a (33/m) going through the toughest time of my life right now as I'm sure lots of people are. I've been a heavy drinker for 15 years and it's time to stop. I'm new to reddit and I've never really talked about my issues till now. I'm finding that reddit can be a good support system.

This should be a happy time in my life I've got a good job, a roof over my head and a fiancée but I've had very bad depression for over a month and I don't know how to help myself. I've had selfs esteem issues since I was young and I've masked that with alcohol. But I feel like the booze has done more bad then good. I've cut my drinking down which is making me reflect on things I've done. Driving drunk, being mean to people and worst of all hurting people I love by cheating. I've came clean to my SO about my infidelities and she has forgiven me. My family has forgiven me for being so hurtful though the years. I'm very lucky to have these people in my life and I never want to hurt them again so it's time to give up the booze.

I went 3 weeks sober then got depressed and started thinking of all those bad things I've done so I relapsed and it's getting worse. So it's time to stop. Sorry for rambling on I just felt like I should tell my story. If anyone would like to chat just reach out cause I won't be drinking tonight.

alcoholism,Sorrowful43,2019/02/09,"Am I at risk of alcoholism? Basically, every time something goes wrong, I feel like drinking. Exam went wrong? Drink. Had a crappy day? Drink. Broke up with my girlfriend? Lock myself in my room and drink for the whole night. Even right now, as I'm working on a project which does not seem to get anywhere, I have half a mind to go for my alcohol stash, which is not even half a meter away from me.

Thing is, most of the time I manage to fight the urge and not drink(or at least invite a friend over, so I won't be drinking alone), but I still think that the fact that my brain makes the association something went wrong-drink might not be very good on the long run. I have depression and mild anxiety(the causes of which I'm yet to completely figure out) and no history of alcoholism in my family(as far as I know). Do you guys think I could be at risk of developing alcoholism later in life(I'm 20 right now)?",4.18936398796734,5.438409810055866,4.546480446927376,86.99107434464979,71.01117318435755,8.189256553502362,26.05973356252686,8.617729084823388,1.5782768371293514,712,22,150,12,13,224,111,179,0.14800000000000002,0.8240000000000001,0.029,-0.9657,0,1,13,0,1,0,29.0,0,1,0,1,7,10,1,2,11,0,13,10,1,2,1,24,25,8,0,1,5,0,1,1,2,2,4,0,1,1,6,6,9,0,6,5,0,4,6,7,0,2,3,1,17,3,27,16,3,31,0,2,0,0,5,17,0,3,11,96,23,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4049117177052268,0.0,0.09810237696671263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08899348602713754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10573994845442856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09730454652902903,0.0,0.0,0.09931315352679797,0.0,0.0,0.07562700121145155,0.0,0.0,0.06108720103502184,0.0,0.0815830479638376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289097470445582,0.0,0.0,0.6495335514542752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251246381644691,0.0,0.07980651747262874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04789377745996963,0.06766869258369433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07318120017975555,0.0,0.04948780664132078,0.0,0.0538321201914611,0.0794474705283784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937886698973792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05205617770644788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06690423488907406,0.04627589007886882,0.0,0.0,0.08382509347417598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06322699485200786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10048399938246123,0.09564119572180152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888923043944354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16178241200501978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623042978749487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14584168805671258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07564430318323838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0629284153874729,0.12138676858474053,0.0,0.0,0.11046513938066517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0781547348884149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756146092496535,0.0,0.10575260015537044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06895800721263587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106875917056457,0.0,0.0

I continued to throw up around every 20 minutes for a couple more hours but it was just the water I couldn’t keep down, no blood. About 8 hours after I puked blood ( and 5 hours after the last time I puked) I feel fine besides a bit feverish and lightheaded. I’ve been able to hold down water and food since then.

alcoholism,Jordatov,2019/02/09,"I'm 21 and a serious alcoholic. I need advice. I meant advice, not help. I do not want to quit alcohol. I want to stop being the way I am.

Throwback to years 17-19 of my life. Alcohol was an amazing thing.(I live in Ireland, 18 is the legal age). It was once a week, meeting my friends and having great nights together.

Now however, those nights still happen. But when my friends wake up Sunday morning, dying with a hangover, I go straight to the nearest bar to get some more of that buzz.

I drink alone, a lot. Sitting in my kitchen, playing music and downing jameson and cokes. My life is pretty shit, but I won't go into that. All I will go into is that being tipsy, drunk, absolutely fucked, I feel happy. It's an escape.

I just want to go back to being able to enjoying alcohol on the weekends with my friends, not depending on it. Is there any way to that point from here? Or is it an all or none situation?

Relatives don't want to invite me to parties anymore with how drunk I get. My dad has lost all respect he had of me and barely talks to me.

I just feel clueless and if anyone has ever been in a somewhat similar situation; your knowledge would be hugely appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",2.4232925897631787,4.4895362184874035,4.197158135981667,84.23941940412531,77.57142857142857,6.8482811306340725,27.624904507257448,7.84624498591911,1.8325815126050429,932,40,182,15,22,314,142,238,0.127,0.6920000000000001,0.181,0.9609,1,1,5,0,0,0,40.0,0,2,0,3,10,14,2,0,12,0,22,15,2,2,4,41,41,13,1,7,10,1,2,0,3,3,6,0,1,0,9,11,10,1,4,6,0,5,6,4,0,0,6,2,25,10,29,28,8,35,0,1,0,1,10,14,2,7,13,129,34,1,0.11277952463475825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22041369242383727,0.0,0.4821080535638917,0.0,0.11680557499658267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669394412632419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11184698367539768,0.0788580658791825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08672049297952908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704734098024765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110480998528612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201553678177692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404943260178756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2613995429133221,0.10426285321978522,0.11784529363688215,0.0,0.2563808114203929,0.0,0.0,0.12433982405651862,0.0,0.0,0.09973056117441688,0.12005590110043934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07559373807232855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593190270726341,0.0,0.0,0.09958638646916616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12311217361475894,0.09588111881050496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08362458849250548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21167188795039985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010651301051273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066131043437335,0.0,0.0,0.11473732152453335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11995490675515187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11576656135226195,0.0,0.2535378219326335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09006587405656892,0.09428873252748242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09064790988895316,0.0,0.10383223387668604,0.0,0.0,0.07492570486290719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.266081142585228,0.17903827440059966,0.09046493190594557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08011533849789243,0.0,0.0,0.07262631624282398
alcoholism,notnotweird,2019/02/10,"Super functional but feel terrible in my body. So I often joke to people that I’m an alcoholic, but I’m honestly starting to worry that I actually am.

Lately my kidneys have been hurting and I’m fairly certain it’s because of the alcohol and I’m scared that I’m destroying my body. I keep telling myself I’ll take a break from drinking and then don’t. I guess I’m hoping that by putting this info out into the void it will motivate me to stop drinking for my health.

alcoholism,TerminallyOdd,2019/02/10,"I feel like the best version of myself after a few drinks - and it scares me. For many years now, I've used alcohol as a crutch. I'm not a daily drinker or a person who drinks when alone, but every social event has to include alcohol (with pregaming), otherwise I wouldn't even be sure how to get out of my own way. 

I was diagnosed with an essential tremor about 12 years ago, and I'm finding that alcohol is the only thing that really ""fixes"" me. I inherited it from my dad, apparently. It's relatively mild now, but it was a bane on my life and while the neurologist suggested beta blockers which have helped, nothing compares to a few drinks. I'm still and calm after a few and it's invigorating. It breathes new life into me, and I feel like I can be this version of myself that exists without worries. I'm funny, charming, and full of life. It's to the point where my crew of friends see me as this carefree, level-headed, calm/cool/collected individual, because that's the way I am after a few - left to my own sober devices, I worry about everything, and about people's perception of me. I admittedly hide this side of me from people.

The compulsion is there basically every time I have to go anywhere that isn't work and deal with people. Dinner with the family? I'm having a few beforehand and at dinner. Meeting up with friends? Definitely drinks involved. Even something like getting a haircut, I have a few before, since I'm worried the tremor will kick in while I'm trying to hold my head steady. 

I've been managing this way for years, since at the end of the day, it doesn't amount to constant drinking - a couple of nights a week, basically. I know that's a poor rationalization, but the reason I write this, is because I'm afraid it's a slippery slope. I've tried therapy a few times, admitting to a generalized social anxiety, but I didn't find much help in any of it - really, it's hard to accept some cognitive reconditioning, when 3 beers will fix it all. 

I don't know if I can get it out of my head that I can go the rest of my life doing this. I really don't have an inherent need for deep relationships anyway, where this person and I know every little thing about each other, so I'm not sure if I'm even missing out on anything. I have a few close friends that I've had a very surface-level conversation with about it, but nothing beyond that...I've decided marriage and children aren't for me (for a few reasons) - but with that, I don't feel like I'd have to hide this from anyone. It's a confusing state of affairs, to say the least. 

Sorry for the long post, just needed to get this off my chest - any thoughts would be appreciated.

alcoholism,NewYorkUtahFlorida,2019/02/10,"Trying to fix myself Hi there. I'm 25 years old and I personally think I've been an alcoholic since I was 21. I dont know where to go or what to do to stop drinking and just was looking for any advice possible.

Little backstory: never drank a drop till I was 19. From 19-21 would drink approx. 10 times a year at parties or friends houses in reasonable amounts, had never been drunk to point of passing out or puking or anything like that, not even at college parties. At 21 I got a job as kitchen manager at a restaurant. Friends with all bartenders. Made friends with cooks and bartenders at the other local bars (lived in a lakeside resort type town so there were lots of bars compared to the number of actual permanent residents). Bartenders became only friends. Started hanging with them while they're at work. Get free drinks from them. Continue to get free drinks from them. Restaurant I work for doesn't take inventory seriously and gives me an opportunity to steal beers and get away with it guaranteed. By 23 I was drinking between 8 and 16 beers a day with a few mixed drinks added in. By this time I blacked out occasionally puked weekly at least. Never let it effect my job, or hid it well enough. Now am 25, just moved to a new city and dont have those bartender friends. I've been here for 4 months now and have only puked/blacked out one time (new years) and have cut my intake to 4-8 beers a day, no hard liquor at all. That's just from moving to a better environment and not even trying. My issue is that I want to stop all together. I hate that I've let myself become this person, gain weight, act like a drunk idiot, and on and on. I dont smoke cigarettes or do other drugs outside alcohol and the occasional weed and I eat a moderately healthy diet so the only thing holding me back from what I want to be as far as health and awareness goes is alcohol.

I just want to stop. I've eased up but I want to work to be DONE. I have no (honest) alcoholics that I know well enough to talk to about this. What should I do/where should I go? Any ideas help, thank you for reading!",3.4865879953379917,5.088846971153849,4.2749213286713275,86.86629079254082,73.27884615384616,7.253962703962704,25.827214452214452,7.898369717300924,1.3604737179487176,1644,55,338,23,33,527,213,416,0.058,0.8079999999999999,0.134,0.9678,2,0,16,0,0,0,48.0,0,1,3,7,18,20,3,0,18,0,30,26,0,3,6,61,52,29,0,7,13,0,2,2,5,3,6,0,1,2,18,23,24,4,6,16,2,7,11,5,2,1,13,4,30,17,61,32,9,58,0,0,2,0,15,24,0,7,28,213,48,9,0.0,0.0,0.07091012833369033,0.0,0.0,0.07100696680614876,0.0,0.3106252627042875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098828784816847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059796741257944076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06827074586237171,0.0558745611372402,0.0,0.0,0.08025229728665821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06426589808190784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09372525930794193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07436107322729861,0.2554869685720352,0.4271016292479429,0.08426781984677463,0.07435398535824264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15016382937956946,0.0,0.09598851280691256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2807022930786152,0.0,0.11389270006117795,0.06970646698496905,0.08259388773023663,0.0,0.05811648647122384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06509317276782563,0.07174120896938023,0.0,0.07723902907327337,0.0,0.0,0.048705522701674345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08384514582858335,0.0,0.08202944320460047,0.0,0.07584292154058886,0.14421672646585768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07986908339964653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.148608871051363,0.0,0.07100046693678484,0.0728289785409216,0.06416413754153535,0.0,0.06101992915853075,0.0,0.0,0.0617768101958228,0.0,0.06875696339725677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05800015833738826,0.1544618546348222,0.0,0.0,0.16813016433693698,0.14035976922893226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07624923196993062,0.0,0.04923938626466669,0.16579401625611045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126895781553488,0.0,0.0,0.0686914962313589,0.08191837307484875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07268422381845686,0.0,0.0,0.07471126969513289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0601088747255094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05143234939816525,0.0,0.0,0.18225247698038333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05463470572093014,0.058405020647760375,0.0,0.06689976383239217,0.0,0.0,0.04827510468721112,0.04656051582571038,0.0,0.0,0.12711386744096906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09866893249552801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17143776007309527,0.0,0.05828712677807561,0.08848585783717733,0.13066833176799575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587019948006262,0.0,0.0,0.05161881840302579,0.0,0.0,0.1403807822462489
alcoholism,billyrakerblue,2019/02/10,"Almost a year. Since I have went to rehab and been sober I am dealing with a lack of happiness and self-worth.   And today I decided to read my evaluation that the psychologist wrote about me at the end of my  rehabilitation stay.   My work is insisting I give the report them to understand my risk level. To decide if they want to keep me on.  I was told I might have narcissistic disorder.  So I went on internet and watched the videos and read all about it and it was like putting in your symptoms and getting told you are dying of 19 rare diseases in the next week.   I can relate to all the signals and traits that make you a narcissist.    Then reading how horrible on others I am has pretty much destroyed me.   Being the equivalent of second hand smoke to others emotionally.   

Not sure what I am asking for or want. I just fucking hate this.  I sobered up to be better for my family and others and all I did was become a sober narcissist problem.   And yes I know whining about this all makes it even more proof I am one.  But I am just not able to shake the feeling that the people around me would be way better off if I was out of the picture.   It just sucks. 

Thanks for listening.

alcoholism,SwimSpectre,2019/02/10,"This is my chance I was hired into a restaurant in October I've been f.o.h for 5 years or so, my experience allowed me to serve there. They did one better and let me bartend which would have been huge for me but within a few weeks or so I didn't cut it and was put back to server, which was totally fine. The thing is drinking has ruined jobs for me in the past because I drink before work, it was no different at this job but they didn't fire me. They made me a busser/host and it really fucked me up. They were ignoring my claims to come back, so I felt I had no way out of this and starting drinking even more before work. Just recently I told them to take me off bussing because it was doing terrible things to my self esteem to have my serving team treat me like a bitch boy (I have resumes printed out and was thinking about getting a new job asap) but I think he respected that I had self worth and that I stepped down. He asked me how badly I wanted to serve again and I let him know it was my passion. He told me if I can quit drinking for this whole week, I can get my serving shifts back. I'm excited but something in the back of my head tells me I'll fuck this up. Opinions? Thoughts? I'm 22 btw and suffer from major depression, anxiety and hell of a case of cynicism.

alcoholism,MaPawlys96,2019/02/10,"93 Days Sober and I feel great! I’m a 22 year old guy that has struggled with alcohol since the age of 19. I first started drinking when I was 17 and I was able to handle alcohol just fine. I could relax, have a couple beers, or a couple of shots and then be done for the night. There was no waking up the next day and immediately wanting that drink. I’ve always been someone that has dealt with pretty bad anxiety and mild depression so I used it to relax. When I was 16 or so, I was into smoking weed but the anxiety it brought me of getting caught was too much, even though it was that great escape to feeling calm and relaxed. Alcohol was what I turned to to relax. During my senior year of high school i noticed that my drinking started to increase a little more. Drinking more during the week but never having that feeling of waking up and needing to drink. At the age of 19, I lost my uncle to suicide, this was an uncle that I was extremely close to. My use of alcohol from that point up until 93 days ago we’re out of control. Drinking hard liquor all day, everyday. Sure, I would try to be sober and convince myself I didn’t have a problem for so long. It took me until I turned 22 to really realize how much of a problem it was. I signed up for a great residential program, been going to outpatient 3 times a week, and have been attending AA meetings. Denial is such a tough part of this as alcoholics. The whole disease itself is a struggle in itself everyday. If I can do it, you guys all can! I feel healthier than I’ve ever felt in my life. No cravings, nothing. That won’t happen for everyone but it’s just a great feeling!!!",2.993020202020201,4.638566524242428,4.516666666666668,84.44944444444447,74.66666666666667,7.191919191919192,26.767676767676768,7.921354282810032,1.6621919191919186,1283,48,253,19,27,429,172,330,0.104,0.74,0.156,0.9646,0,0,12,0,0,1,36.0,0,1,0,3,14,20,0,2,19,0,32,16,2,4,5,45,54,26,1,7,8,0,7,0,0,2,6,0,0,2,21,14,13,1,7,12,0,6,5,8,1,1,21,7,27,12,42,28,9,48,0,2,0,0,4,13,0,3,29,183,48,3,0.07716376456299237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06840102148995586,0.4123229865926982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06420643357670737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11806013736835552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442852027749958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08654572332547503,0.061608987130881025,0.17076047562138505,0.0,0.19905697817664228,0.0,0.0664610373489335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0789653218347714,0.0,0.4535466763185155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050965938745060564,0.06979904275611948,0.0,0.07373328382042267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19508158937377984,0.0,0.07408931487466659,0.0,0.0,0.0656354587181539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040314882167230406,0.0,0.04385394564080074,0.0,0.0,0.34029329137087344,0.0,0.15280851717429028,0.06823566216580823,0.0,0.06912357654045734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815277538454568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05450304891446972,0.0,0.07733836374042953,0.0,0.06828750343618556,0.0,0.0,0.08423336426016198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134484910606873,0.057215953684948286,0.059513452226172416,0.0,0.08206453901656513,0.0724129658256019,0.0,0.07404071321642991,0.08785145739295476,0.08097039056651664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356083746775766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07294469904490235,0.0,0.0,0.07850328943467466,0.0,0.14767060298550033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04943308347016923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07809384931452656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0638306634348483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06538060730834283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923381943480516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16133664154146982,0.0,0.08440463424613423,0.0,0.07272593490497714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07581300690130817,0.0,0.044994811651237726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08573178165259229,0.05238913097573746,0.16786403542349074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13328943476520372,0.0,0.0,0.04551318758345497,0.0,0.12379223497181008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08615058745768257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054814924408987435,0.0,0.0,0.0993818689303382
alcoholism,Kangaro0o,2019/02/10,"How do you distract yourself from going for a drink? Hey everyone. I realize that I have an alcohol problem and I want to stop completely before it takes over my life. I drink 5 times a week (usually 5+ shots) and it’s starting to feel like a habit I can’t break. My spouse travels for work and I get so bored/lonely that it leads to me drinking to pass the time. I have very little social support nearby as I did not grow up where I currently live.  

It usually hits hardest at about 2:30PM and I always convince myself that it’s okay and I can stop at any time. I absolutely understand the health risks but I just don’t care. I absolutely do not want to tell anyone in real life so AA or anything like that is out of the question. I find that even if I do a hobby (reading, TV, running, etc.) I will still drink while doing it or drink afterward. I feel like I just need videos or something, anything, that will distract me when the urge hits. I’ve tried some books but a lot of them focus on the health aspect of alcohol, which does nothing for me. I don’t want to feel ashamed; it just leads to more drinking. What I really need is encouragement and something that will lift me up when I’m struggling. Even a chat room or something where I can talk to others who are struggling. Any suggestions?

alcoholism,capten_planets,2019/02/10,"Sickeness and Alcohol Just an interesting question, a person I work with recently got the flu and we come into contact a lot. So usually more than likely I’m at risk! 

However, I drink every night... a lot... (I’ve gone through the whole I know I have a problem and I’m an alcoholic stuff before and I’m working on it...) 

My question is, if you were to constantly introduce this toxin (alcohol) into your body on a daily basis, would I be less likely to get sick from the flu? 

My reasoning would be I’m making my body a hostile environment for any disease to try and make my body it’s host...

Just curious if anyone knows anything in regards to this,

I'm worried about it not being very stimulating as far as extra curricular activities outside of therapies and what not. I've done some stays in inpatient for mental health at a local hospital and they were very very boring. Barely any kind of activity outside of watching TV and I don't watch TV. 

I'm of course going to put everything into my recovery, but i know I'll have free time and right now I need constant mental stimulation.",4.4949725274725285,6.862091615384612,6.481414835164838,68.85421016483521,72.4065934065934,9.385164835164835,28.957417582417587,9.827888789773867,3.418438461538462,391,16,62,11,8,136,67,91,0.062,0.887,0.051,0.2739,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,1,0,2,3,0,0,1,0,6,2,0,2,0,16,12,7,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,1,2,1,3,3,1,0,0,2,2,6,3,13,8,2,15,0,0,2,0,1,7,0,1,4,39,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14001868421709984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22250415455476535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21070662053679068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18504914604683487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2340348008081793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.218861483343919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144125888757404,0.11315695106409893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41499642802322384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15267183064194612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20698581354747195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17583700230084662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2194614141825408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354639613945536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12006162305726215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5096658207062656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2091008825240389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,meeowmiix,2019/02/10,"I need help Don’t really know how to go about this. I am just tired of feeling like I need a drink and by A drink I really mean three a day. I black out about once a month. I’m known for my drinking and although I’ve made major cut backs I am still not where I’d like to be. I’ve tried AA, but I felt very uncomfortable and didn’t feel a group setting was my thing. I’ve been drinking since I was a teenager and maybe only gone about 2 months sober about 4 yrs ago. I’m having huge guilt trips because my fiancé is constantly asking me to go a day without a drop of alcohol, which I lie about doing, and just make sure to hide any evidence of it. He’s such a good person and is currently the care taker of his alcoholic and drug addicted father. I’ve lost friends because of their alcoholism and I just can’t seem to find the motivation. Please, I will take any advice. Any tips. I just want to start caring enough to stop.

alcoholism,sirpranksamillion,2019/02/10,"Athletics and drinking Hello,

I’ve Never posted here before but I thought this is the most apt community for my question.

I’ve been a fairly regular drinker over the past ten years since turning 21.  Recently, my wife and I are expecting a Child and we’ve made a ‘pact’ not to drink/take drugs during the pregnancy as kind of an act of solidarity. This worked for times we are together but when we are separated, like this weekend when she’s out of town, I get a “hall pass” to drink beer and go out with my buddies.

Anyways, I’ve noticed throughout my adulthood that when I’ve had a couple, I am much more focused and excel at individual athletics such as golf, bowling, etc. I’ve joked around in the past that I need my ‘aiming fluid’ in a shitty round of golf but alcohol really does help in these situations.  It seems to focus me in on my task and reduces performance anxiety.

I’m wondering if anyone has similar experiences and, if so, is there a way to mimic the calming effects of alcohol in these situations without drinking?  I’m sure practicing sober is the only real way to get better at a task or sport, but any advice from this community would be greatly appreciated.  I went out drinking then bowling last night with the boys and rolled a 145. The previous weekend I barely rolled a 100 when sober so I still feel there is something up with me when It comes to skilled tasks and drinking.

I understand this community is probably not the most appropriate place to ask such questions but I feel, from reading your posts, at least a couple of you all have been in similar situations.  Thanks in advance!",6.355376676986588,6.995962869281048,7.195627794977642,72.15874613003099,65.73202614379086,10.49439284485724,35.05951152390781,10.426177893888326,3.7786169934640528,1282,58,230,31,19,428,174,306,0.03,0.848,0.122,0.9838,0,0,12,0,0,0,27.0,2,2,0,7,15,9,0,0,21,0,16,9,0,2,3,49,34,27,0,5,11,1,3,1,0,1,3,0,0,2,11,19,8,0,9,13,0,6,4,0,0,1,6,3,23,9,40,26,7,47,0,0,1,0,13,20,0,9,18,154,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09298241188422128,0.0,0.20337924162614304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06470730400964966,0.0,0.0727917857632474,0.0,0.0,0.06653319112200687,0.0,0.0,0.08470634501375987,0.08895521176598101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08096819599459927,0.0,0.0,0.08415509737058492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08196588543834693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105699728178324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08326903290715224,0.0,0.0,0.5592822985323646,0.11034727275380048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061207493213883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307789397442998,0.0,0.0,0.09622443325298856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09942703206016017,0.0,0.05407764359952191,0.0,0.0,0.1049065201612173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06377905121967851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09908720860686523,0.0,0.07756239618939488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04648695020807795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003607079803394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06994840460575916,0.07055474499203786,0.07338786081473699,0.0,0.0,0.0892946461414403,0.0,0.0,0.10833232296832952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236814545982463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18166861358873929,0.0,0.0,0.09941463436676014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18226054558861124,0.0,0.10259102934648953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21318627711336588,0.0,0.09517875133327693,0.10830494744083843,0.060957449343808215,0.0,0.09395210971630397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662371894134344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07871154619070976,0.32086788159017665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07325342937110027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07598930997568643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968057789934303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08760409964564153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755408545608604,0.05548448042128831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10349914184646787,0.0,0.09905763039529658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1510560472926082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08820778576150583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09172409798004508,0.1031893712578828,0.06927251841679638,0.0,0.0,0.06759396224922744,0.0,0.0,0.061275413303621476
alcoholism,ak4161,2019/02/10,"Treatment Center Recommendations For Someone Without Insurance? Hello. Can anyone recommend the best treatment center options in the U.S. for someone without insurance?

My sister is 21 and alcoholism has been destroying her life since she was a teenager. Our mom passed away when she was 13 and it’s been pretty rough for her ever since. 

From recent conversations, she sounds like she now may be open to getting help. 
She has no insurance or a dime to her name. 

She went through a short period of treatment years ago but relapsed soon after. 

What are the best treatment facilities in the U.S for someone without insurance? State funded or something that’s not 50k/month.

Thanks so much!

alcoholism,jayparkeroni,2019/02/10,"Short, sweet, and simple. I’ve been drinking since I was 15.
Not too much, but I was introduced to it. 
I’m currently drinking, and as I type this; so please forgive me; for my improper grammar and so forth.
Im 23 now. 
I drink day in and day out. 
The part of my body right under my lower right rib aches. 
Not a sharp pain but more like a dull pain. 
Like a, “I need some room to breathe or spread my legs out kinda pain”. 
I know it is my liver. 
Yet I’ll still keep drinking to rid my problems and forget about my bad ones. 
I’ve been doing it for almost 5 years now knowing what is happening. 
I’m in a dire situation. 
The people around me think lightly of it. 
I’m asking the people of Reddit on this page what they think because it feels like no one understands. 
With what you know. 
What would you do ?

Unfortunately when I stopped the pain killers I replaced them with weed and then alcohol as well. I stopped smoking weed about three years ago but I haven’t stopped the drinking. I got married in September and now my drinking is causing serious strain on my marriage. I want to stop but I’m having a REALLY hard time with it because my husband also drinks but he doesn’t have trouble moderating it. I on the other hand just keep drinking and drinking and drinking once I start and I almost always end up really hammered. But I want to stop, I need to stop.

alcoholism,towa,2019/02/11,"Struggling to find someone who understands I will try to keep this as concise as possible, but forgive me if it gets long. 

I ended my relationship with my boyfriend about a year ago. We were together for 5 years. I loved him so much and would have done anything to help him get better, but he refused to help himself, so I had to let it go.  I didn't want to. I wanted to help him. I truly envisioned being with him forever.

I'm still struggling now with the negative connotation he has given alcohol. I'm still struggling to let go of the fact that I love him. I'm still struggling to see a life without him. I thought maybe this would get better with time, but I'm realizing maybe that's not the case.

I feel like it's affecting every part of my life. I don't feel normal around alcohol. My work requires being around functions with alcohol. I hate being there. My family drinks when I'm home. I hate being there. Social gatherings with friends always have alcohol. I hate being there.  All of these things trigger the emotions I felt every time I watched him walk to the fridge and grab another beer, or pour another glass of wine. 

Disgust. Despair. Hatred.

I don't know how to move on with my life without isolating myself. I feel like alcohol is such a part of ""normal"" life. 

I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this. I guess I'm just looking for validation that I'm not the only one who's felt this way. Perhaps some advice on what to do. 

My friends and family try to understand, but I just never really feel like they quite get it. I'm not alone, but I feel alone.

alcoholism,itryeveryday,2019/02/11,"I’m just having such a hard time   

I have written and erased this 3 times, I’m just having such a hard time and it’s so difficult to express my feelings… it’s not easy to keep it short.

A lot of things happened to me last year, 2 months ago I woke up sick and tired of myself in alcohol, I didn’t do anything to regret the night before, I just woke up tired of having to drink to be fun to hang with, to tell the joke, to land the pun… That’s not really me; I haven’t craved or planned weekend activities around alcohol. I’m having peaceful nights, I know what I’m doing, I wake up knowing what I did the night before, I know where I’m going, I notice my kids are having a better time with me, but no one else feels the same around me. Not my wife or the rest of my family. 

My wife doesn’t drink and writing this comes to my mind that she never noticed how drunk I have been half our marriage -and I really mean half as in one day drunk and the other sober- for the last 12 years. 

I don’t really want to come out and tell everyone that I’m an alcoholic, that I’m trying to change my life, I can’t go to AA, my family expects so much from me, I don’t know what to do, please advise me.

alcoholism,Scarn0nCunce,2019/02/11,"Hi. I'm nearly 24 and I know I have drunk too much since my teens, but wanted your opinion on exactly how fucked I am I'm a bit of a recluse and drink by myself at home alot. I am well aware that I drink an unhealthy amount but I'm at the point where I'm drinking a 5L cask of dry white wine a day. I mix it with Solo/lemon fizzy drink to speed up the process.

The 5L is over a 12+ hour period and I feel pretty drunk but not completely blind like I used to get, I can still remember most of my night. 

I am a relatively skinny (have a gut now) 6ft make at 70kgs. I know I'm shearing years off my life with my choices but at the same time I feel like I'm young enough to be able to get away with this for a while. I always convince myself to drink promising myself that I will get results in my social life (which I lack and which alcohol used to help) but once I get tipsy it's back to playing apex legends and being shit at guitar.

I dunno I just assumed there would be a subreddit for this kind of thing and was looking for some similar experiences and how overcame this addiction, because I know I'm smart enough to recognise it as such but my mind is telling my no... but my body.... my body is telling me yes",2.4767975708502017,3.3402010846153867,3.861457489878543,91.75091093117413,74.69230769230771,7.0121457489878525,24.45344129554656,7.273561745256523,0.7745000000000002,942,28,221,10,19,311,148,260,0.113,0.789,0.098,-0.6990000000000001,0,0,7,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,0,11,10,2,0,15,1,15,19,5,6,1,43,37,18,0,3,9,0,2,2,0,2,5,0,1,0,11,10,10,0,7,10,0,0,2,2,1,0,1,5,33,8,32,31,10,26,0,0,3,1,6,14,2,6,14,141,44,0,0.1125716114288088,0.0,0.0,0.1227196726513268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12030481740425647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09366859863253976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10576473456821206,0.08656062055787023,0.0,0.06862260947508032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12289904388851798,0.2500833656884061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802919281857165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259937655452586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5513866137008286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23263313378900746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011663677604304,0.0,0.0,0.11383917827374575,0.08042118169761253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040706408111537,0.2352560829985344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07545437823300291,0.0,0.11291850479126025,0.0,0.11086036143306616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172260103168176,0.1855992409178994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590253165804619,0.10999360626477404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945318017153842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751424247616184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11366523698395364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08275308705579516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056408315158432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988509223172952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064165591606241,0.0,0.0,0.11452579904793594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12752169122469018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555314143414787,0.0931204002568452,0.0,0.0,0.11475258137436205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08989983430172524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19678510036680144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07478757656739858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564141190105706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19445145714352896,0.0,0.0,0.06639765305059259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10121539798154064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07996764292170723,0.0,0.0,0.07249242695489473
alcoholism,clearwather,2019/02/11,"Searching for a help I am 21yo guy. Im drinking atleast 0,4l (8shots) of alcohol per day for about a year now.

I am seeing changes on my body and mind. Im nervous and unsure all the time, my abs hurts, my gastrointestinal system is changed and really hurts sometimes, I lost weight. I am completely changed person.

It is possible for me to be without drink, last time it was 1 week, before 4days etc, but somehow i always end up with drink.

Try to give me some advice how to improve and get better with it, but please dont type me to search a doctor or go to some psychiatrist.

I know I can do it on my own, I just need to read something to encourage me. 

I am currently living with my parents, and I am a year after ending my college, due to not interest in it.

Thanks for no judging, love you all.

alcoholism,robbobmob,2019/02/11,"One year sober today, and here's to the years to follow! Last year today I woke up without a hangover and road my bike fully loaded with camp gear to the coast.  I remember after riding the 25 miles to get there and walking the coast at sunset, it was balls-ass cold and I remember thinking a half-pint would be nice but not necessary.  It was below 30 degrees the whole night and I huddled around the small fire with the several of layers of clothing only barely keeping me warm.  I woke up the next morning, pack up my bike and rode back home.  Since that day I have not touched beer or booze.  After over ten years of being in an alcoholic haze, I can now say I have actual goals in life, and that I have purpose and hope.   (And I my first day in years, next weekend!) 

Here's to a lifetime of sobriety!

alcoholism,stalegash,2019/02/11,"Day one at fifteen, I got drunk for the first time. it was immediately an every weekend experience. By 16 it was Friday through Sunday. 17 I got alcohol poisoning at a house party and decided to stop. By 18 I was getting into meth but I did not allow it to continue, alcohol was in the background. 19 came around and I was drinking casually every day, by 20 I'd be blacked out by 8pm. 21 and blackout looks closer to 2pm, that is until 3 days ago. I finally got around to opening my textbook for accounting and realised my midterm for it was that next morning, the whole first month of school was almost blank in my mind. Denial shot out of me like a rocket and I was practically arguing with myself about the severity of my condition. I decided to stop drinking, I am very sick and feel the need to put this monologue somewhere. I did well the day before but shamefully went through a six pack last night. Could only sleep a measly 2 hours before waking to horrible stomach cramps and extreme sweating, mild tachycardia,  emotional distress. It is incredible, the unconscious gymnastics I've been doing to avoid thinking about this. I keep thinking ""how could I not know I am a drunk?"" I've literally been drinking non-stop for minimum 18 months (3 years daily), stopping only to sleep, yet last week I would have told you that alcoholism would never be a problem for me. I'm going to stop now before it kills me later. I just discovered this sub so apologies if there is a broken rule that I missed.

alcoholism,GoldenNugget000,2019/02/11,"I need some advice I’ve a problem, I’ve been made aware of this by friends, family and co workers. I know it myself. I can’t seem to stop though. I’ve been binge drinking for a year now. I’ve became dependent on alcohol. I need it to help me sleep at night, drown out my mind and escape. I can’t do it anymore. I’m tired of waking up with no memory of the day before and immediately craving another drink to make me feel “happy”. It doesn’t...I know alcohol isn’t my friend.

I know I need to stop drinking or at least cut back but every time I say I’m going to and make an attempt I always relapse. I don’t want to go to AA meetings but I think it’s the best way to keep me motivated to stay sober. If anyone has any advice as to how to resist those cravings please tell me!

alcoholism,drunkenfool32,2019/02/11,"Relapsed, now retaining water like CRAZY God I went nearly 10 months since I was hospitalized. I started drinking again this January due to the threat of job loss at work, but i managed to quit last Tuesday. Figured it would be like before, things would clear up in a week or so and the swelling would reduce. 

I am absurdly thirsty and keep drinking water, but nothing comes out the other end. I am so swollen I feel like I'm going to pop. I feel like there is half a beach ball lodged inside me made out of fluids. I CANNOT PEE. Its not like I'm eating much either, anything but small nibbles are making me gag. 

I keep hoping that this will subside like last time, but on the other hand I'm looking up ER rates to go and get pumped full of diuretics. The actual liver pain has gone away now, it's just swelling, 

This isn't as bad as last time when I went nuts with DTs but this is awful. If anyone knows any treatment for the water retention other than going to the hospital, please help me.

alcoholism,Absolutely5Jokers,2019/02/12,"I'm so sick of this daily routine, but I can't seem to change it. The second I have a chance to (off work or the weekends) it all goes out the window, ill do it tommorow no doubt is always my justification. I have been drinking every single day for the last 4 or 5 years easily...before that it was when I drink I won't stop drinking until I pass out and wake up covered in my own piss. I have a very good handle on that kind of thing now, which I thought was a positive thing, but it isn't...I recently tried to stop for a while 100%, (I work in QC and check peoples work through a computer) My hands were shaking so bad I couldn't even type in my password to get started...I had to go home ""sick"" because I simply could not type. 

Maybe it was a mix of anxiety once I had trouble doing it that just amplified it but regardless that is ridiculous. So what? AA? Tried it, I don't like it...is that something i have to get over? What is a better way to look at it? 

I don't want this anymore, its ridiculous...but how, its so easy to hate it up until you crave it, and I really do.

 No excuses, I know its as simple as just stop doing it, but I can't...it conquers my thought process, I don't feel like I need it (most of the time) but I want it, badly.",0.7015849056603791,2.4200899509433995,2.8375849056603784,93.59826415094341,81.56603773584905,5.749433962264153,21.543396226415094,6.742157984588678,0.31981056603773617,947,29,221,10,25,321,140,265,0.195,0.7070000000000001,0.099,-0.9773,0,0,4,0,0,0,51.0,0,1,0,5,10,13,3,2,12,0,25,9,3,2,1,34,39,21,0,6,10,0,2,2,0,1,3,0,2,0,30,5,3,3,6,4,1,3,9,8,1,1,9,3,27,5,30,27,4,29,0,0,1,0,2,11,1,5,16,153,57,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11313962866939613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10401823741351174,0.0,0.13484772558755773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2270619454733083,0.08288729272862677,0.0,0.1157021900974208,0.0,0.0,0.12025621855633098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14384038766780516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085626087354304,0.0,0.0,0.08769071625840771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39960249841326817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08980824916111227,0.0,0.11456230700849693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06875154825603673,0.09713845159695872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14207955633609934,0.0,0.07727604305510033,0.114046894889784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342442378121215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13639104127205848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14159395433756508,0.07472667647902716,0.11083535946528217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13285813976596772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11418226705285725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13660218873185556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10082154378107078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448057835401654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942658911400042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710716973738228,0.0,0.13425598440126554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12378383725587007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046779183637532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3410361382681079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18066756128408795,0.0,0.0,0.2158932209655573,0.07928638920877926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1846321776407646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11219117204963977,0.1603996626475366,0.10792827532170857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2969677907207616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08756153488743326
alcoholism,ricosalsa,2019/02/12,"So I think I'm heading down the path towards alcoholism...how do I turn myself around? When I go to the movies I bring a flask...I'm right now on a three hour train ride and I wish I remembered to pick up some booze to spike my drink. When I have long flights I sneak rum on board....any social events I go to I ask if there will be alcohol...  

I don't drink heavily on a work night if I do its usually one or two beers. I don't drink till I pass out...at home or at parties. I limit my drinks to two when I'm driving and usually with a meal. 

So on one hand I'm responsible with my intake and on the other I enjoy having it available to me. I haven't yet missed events or gave up opportunities just to drink. No one has yet told me they are concerned with my intake. 

So I'm wondering where on the spectrum am I? What kind of steps should I take to avoid going down the rabbit hole?

alcoholism,ThrowiiingUpAway,2019/02/12,"First sober party tonight... 11 days sober this round. 
Was a fancy party with bartenders etc. Older crowd in some antique-filled mansion. I’m 35 years old but most people were 60 plus. I have an interesting job so I was invited as local color. 
Everyone had wine and I kept wondering how so many older people were able to drink - and it never became a problem. Here I am, 35 and I’m done drinking for life?!
Anyway I ordered my sparkling water “in a wine glass please” and the young bartender asked me “You don’t like drinking?” And this was the first time anyone had questioned me about that. I responded “Not anymore.” With a laugh. Not my best comedy work, but then I’d be funnier if I was drinking. At least, the addict in me *thinks* I would. 
Anyway. Today I’m sober.

alcoholism,waitwhatttttt,2019/02/12,"Tips on staying sober at a social gathering at a bar? Sorry if this gets long, I just want to give some background. So I’ve (25F) been sober about 2 1/2 years. In that time I’ve lost basically every friend I had. Since I’ve gotten sober and have finally been able to work again I’ve started forming friendships with my coworkers. However, most of them are just slightly younger than me and are at their peak drinking stage of life so on the weekends that’s basically all they do, which is why I’ve never hung out with them outside of work except for one time. 
 For one of my coworker’s birthday about 3 months ago she invited me out to the bar they all go to. This girl is very nice to me and I wanted to make an effort to be her friend so I went. I was able to stay sober despite everyone constantly offering me drinks. After a while everyone stopped offering. While I was fairly uncomfortable the whole time, I was glad I went. It had been a really long time since I hung out/got invited out with friends. 
 So fast forward a little bit. I’ve since confided in the girl who’s birthday it was that I really can’t drink. She sent me a message the other day saying “hey, I know you are sober, but I just want you to know that the invite is always there.” That meant a lot to me. So this Friday, all the girls at work are once again trying to get me to go out with them and I’ve decided that I want to go. Just for a short time, I get out of work late anyway. So I really just want to make an appearance but I want to be more comfortable than I was last time. Does anyone have any tips on how to still have a good time at a bar while sober? Or does anyone think that all of this is just a horrible idea and a recipe for disaster?

alcoholism,CallMeZami,2019/02/13,"Do these symptoms sound like anything related to alcohol consumption or alcohol-related health complications? My ex (41M) is an alcoholic and dependent on marijuana. He has 14 hours a week visitation with my son. His visits were supervised until he passed his drug test. Now they are unsupervised. My son is almost 2.  I have noticed over the last two months that his health has been declining. He's required to do a breathalyzer on drop off and pick up of my son. The last two months he has actually passed each time (he visits two days a week). This is the longest he has went with no breathing anything into the breathalyzer. Over the last several weeks I have noticed a persistent hoarseness in his voice and involuntary bouts of coughing. Last week he missed a visit saying that he was admitted to the hospital. I assumed that it was drug or alcohol related but I have no way of knowing because he refused to provide any information therefore I have no idea if he is even fit to watch a toddler. 

Today he visited with our son. When I dropped my son off he seemed to be moving in slow motion and sore with some extreme dry skin and lips but he passed the breathalyzer so everything was Ok. When it came time to drop my son off, he was an hour late. This always means that he has been drinking. As each hour the amount of alcohol decreases. When he came into the police station, he was out of breathe, with labored breathing and physically unable to lift my son out of the stroller. My son actually slid himself out and crawled up the steps on his own as my ex could barely physically move.

When it came time for him to take the breathalyzer, his hands were visibly shaking as he attempted to blow into it. He blew too lightly twice and then ultimately blew a .018. He smelled like alcohol too. I was furious as he had been drinking with my son. He claimed it was cough medicine which is his go-to excuse each time. I did get a police report.

I may never know what his medical issue is because he is a pathological liar but I am wondering if these symptoms sound familiar to anyone that might have any experience with alcoholics or alcohol related health problems?

I wouldn't rule out other drug issues but I've only ever seen him do cocaine and that was once. He also takes a monthly drug test. 

Tldr: do the symptoms of coughing bouts, dry face and lips, slight skin discoloration, hoarse voice, shortness of breathe and lack of physical strength and unable to lift things sound like any alcohol or drug related health issue that you are familiar with?",5.120861133099627,6.990591039748953,5.7659516001357005,76.733594368427,69.56485355648536,9.435349994345813,32.58419088544612,9.836113211274913,3.4168842474273435,2039,94,363,51,37,661,221,478,0.077,0.879,0.044,-0.9432,0,0,17,0,0,0,46.0,1,1,1,4,11,10,2,1,25,1,44,38,10,3,2,67,59,34,0,6,10,11,3,3,0,3,26,6,0,0,20,33,10,2,9,2,0,18,5,5,0,4,20,13,35,5,54,34,7,74,0,1,2,0,59,21,0,14,34,226,55,6,0.0,0.0,0.11672362366078212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5752276932063536,0.05988684731912599,0.0,0.0,0.04782665872303754,0.04976319788703777,0.0,0.0,0.12200993874453325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041817590237127916,0.0,0.09843011833074464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07291409383052372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20520563132978686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047750046956761966,0.0,0.0,0.03856977893019732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11717378746104555,0.3467785745719866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039501152049491485,0.054097749765977685,0.0,0.0,0.053749576589591536,0.05850152630166141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0312460503928114,0.0,0.033989001623075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2542829796907737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17668993187773774,0.0,0.0,0.06751344330290958,0.0,0.18726508129231315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06573538260290153,0.19499876359215,0.06746352206591001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08765424605639456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514602444847603,0.0,0.06024802902436404,0.0,0.06344447898311255,0.0,0.0,0.1432092032505018,0.12712815372085176,0.0,0.0,0.04612590257849456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361785483284109,0.0,0.06369120127266252,0.0,0.045484988800707525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05722605219682793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04755995475930763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05444493376039307,0.0,0.0675635056269653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18648330638482968,0.08993300363775476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039732301182549834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13949291940755448,0.0,0.056688884239275414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17526466372721725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04747104251274315,0.19189034938130176,0.0,0.0,0.05544055498457738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06485681464122217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,newhappyrainbow,2019/02/13,"Advice about weening off heavy drinking. I know the best choice is to talk to a doctor. Let’s assume I’m too poor for a doctor and that my problem is in the early stages of needing to make a change.

My question is if anyone knows of an effective way to ween off/lower intake. I have trouble sleeping if I don’t drink. I also feel like I might be too heavy a drinker to quit cold without some Ill effects.

I’m a highly functioning alcoholic. I drink daily, but I’m capable of not drinking when necessary. I don’t drink before or during work, I don’t have withdrawals, I don’t drive after drinking. I DO choose to go home and drink rather than socialize. I DO maintain a functioning relationship (no kids). I DO think that alcohol is effecting my daily life and my friendships, in that I’d rather drink at home than engage publicly. Not because engaging means not drinking (quite the opposite, it would be hard not to drink in any of my circles) it means drinking in public and worrying about driving or alternative transportation as, once I start, I have a hard time realizing when I have had enough that I shouldn’t drive. (Far easier to just go home and not drive ever).

alcoholism,SkeeterLuigi,2019/02/14,"Day 30 - Woohoo! In the fall of 2018 I set a date for myself to stop drinking, January 15th, I turned 50 in November.  I have been concerned about my drinking and wanting to quit for many years.  I tried all the things people try, I'll only drink on the weekend, only drink at social events, only drink 2 days a week, only have 2 drinks,  etc, etc. Which,  naturally never worked.  I remember reading somewhere that you should tell people you're going  to stop drinking,  they'll support you and it makes you accountable. So I did,  and it made the looming date more real. 
So I got really drunk on January 14th, as you do, and the next day I called someone I knew was sober 10 years and asked her to take me to an AA meeting. I had such a knot in my stomach making that call.  30 days later,  I honestly can't believe it, but here we are. 
I feel GREAT. I am so much more productive and well, not drunk &amp; hungover.  It's amazing.
 I do go to meetings at least once a week I am an atheist (and if you are in AA please don't tell me all that stuff I already know about is mor religion) I enjoy it for the fellowship and the shared and very familiar stories. Online I utilize agnostic, athiest &amp; freethinkers websites, literature and groups and that program which also has agnostic 12 steps. 
31 days ago I drank a handle of vodka a week and wine, prosecco, etc, etc. And now, well now I don't, now I choose each day not to drink that day.   If you've made it this far thank you, it feels pretty great. Looking forward to support &amp; the community here on this journey.

alcoholism,malemartian,2019/02/14,"Screaming, restlessness, etc. in my Mom? Hey there. 

It’s 5AM in the morning, and my mom just got done with her regular schedule of getting tanked.

She doesn’t seem to sleep. I’ve tried everything, including taking her to the gym daily to tire her out. 

What usually happens is she’ll start drunkenly sobbing and mumbling thoughts of suicide until randomly going super saiyan 3. She then starts screaming. Not yelling, shouting, etc. but full on screaming bloody hell. I’ll have to run down, try and diffuse, then attempt to lift her and out her in the bed (she’s lost most motor functions). Then she’ll miraculously get back up 15 minutes later and start the process over again. She’s a 58 year old with a full time corporate 9-5 too. 

It happens just like that multiple times a week, almost every time she gets drunk now.

What do I do? Secretly, in bouts of anguish, I pray that she dies soon. There doesn’t feel like any other escape from this. I can’t stop hearing the screams, even when I’m away from home or it’s not happening that night. I haven’t gotten a good nights rest in years.

alcoholism,ghbfrtugfwrpoo,2019/02/14,Am a dead? I've been a heavy drinker for 12 years. Mixed some tramadol 4 years ago and my liver has always been aching since. The pain and bloating correlates with my drinking. Never can stop drinking long enough for it to ever stop hurting. Too scared to see a doctor and before the pain I was a 26oz vodka a night kind of drinker. Now can just yoyo binge or get too sick. Looking for advice from personal experiences. ,2.7647560975609764,5.1188580975609765,3.229451219512196,90.16539634146343,77.78048780487805,5.5634146341463415,23.664634146341466,6.6274283507984215,0.6945317073170738,332,11,65,3,8,103,62,82,0.252,0.691,0.057,-0.9629,0,0,5,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,7,0,7,7,1,0,2,11,10,4,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,4,2,2,0,3,0,0,1,4,0,0,3,2,3,1,8,7,2,10,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,2,10,38,4,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18329840525809996,0.1662759937315029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15607937300308355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15961450022306678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19199335534969755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3675087626167268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19381753432637128,0.0,0.0,0.1696744426175808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18348663133775636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980014179394824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20080542154236444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.195332933950245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1660000427765907,0.1575177226518621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14467120802797134,0.0,0.0,0.1760286263190583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39919102890865704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16378529768941216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18779764000910887,0.0,0.14947485389185805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15516591363667012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3136461100222636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24158731339578746

alcoholism,truddie26,2019/02/16,"Alcohol neuropathy symptoms I wondering if any one has dealt with this and can give me some personal accounts of dealing with it, I have drank pretty heavily over the last couple of years, and in the past month and a half have gone to multiple dr visits and tests to figure out what’s going on but on a side note I have been struggling with a bad sinus infection which led me to quit drinking a lot more than usual but now I have started to feel odd body wise and was wondering if this could be a possible cause of my drinking. I would just like to know if anyone could give me any insight on it? Talk to my dr today about my drinking and the rain a bunch of urine and blood glucose test all came back ok any insight could help",7.589591836734692,5.909692040816327,7.450340136054425,79.05061224489799,63.96598639455782,10.848979591836736,34.605442176870746,9.606745405546679,2.9606217687074827,578,20,118,9,7,185,96,147,0.07400000000000001,0.823,0.103,0.5346,0,0,4,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,0,1,4,5,0,1,9,1,13,13,3,2,1,34,24,12,0,7,6,0,1,1,0,1,6,0,0,1,6,12,5,0,7,3,1,5,0,2,0,2,5,1,11,3,21,14,5,21,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,10,82,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14929755040331608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850037763323498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09768196966031394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10742120631175747,0.11664423966548032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1551759717502997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15978037105132592,0.0,0.1435110895009004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3346188968560714,0.15457615476797087,0.0,0.0,0.14402527569283688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4105604706123797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706368656837981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26802726030774593,0.07939512072557921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363842679332356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767758449568036,0.11387470679799835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825069988750337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11876852968970884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11150775680495886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09466480206635113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13336011471526166,0.0,0.12198125276427213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574915359636146,0.0,0.1421258235934475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14858887840610585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988808664148301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1460454919787989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14520250587646055,0.0,0.11228612171530712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13241991800430133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15386057170999676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30299887507260576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923936096108116,0.0,0.0,0.08996266318071966

alcoholism,aaxt,2019/02/17,"Should I go to AA? I have never posted here before but I've been toying with the idea of going to an AA meeting for a while and I figured this might be a good place to ask if it was a good idea. I have never been able to control how much alcohol I drink and it kept getting worse and worse until recently when I started organizing my whole life around alcohol, how I would get it and when I would be drinking. After about a month like this I realized this was a problem and I went cold turkey. It was a very rough time but I told myself that I would take a one month break and I almost made it but missed the mark by a few hours. Over the course of the month I realized that I have had problems with alcohol consumption for a while now but I don't know if I can really be considered an alcoholic. I've been through what my psychiatrist said is protracted withdrawal and it is starting to get better but I don't think I will ever be able to really control my drinking. I'm on meds for the protracted withdrawal now but I can't really grapple with the fact that I might not be able to drink indefinitely. I just feel weird going to an AA meeting because I feel like I caught myself before I things were out of control for too long and I was able to make it almost a month. I don't know if I really belong there. The reason I want to go is to meet other people who understand all of this but I don't know if it is a good idea.

I'm tryna finish my last 3 subjects in school, but i'm struggling w alcohol abuse, and idk what to do. I realize i'm very lucky to be able to even get a second chance with the school things, but i've been dependent on alcohol every since march last year when me, my mom and brother were thrown out of my childhood home (we were already struggling severely w money), and idk what to do with myself honestly. Does anyone have any similar experiences that they've gotten out of? I really need some hope rn, maybe i should have asked sooner.

alcoholism,Bing238,2019/02/17,"My good friend is going off the rails. We’ve been buddies since we were 7. we’re 22 now and these past months he’s started drinking almost daily and usually to the point of blacking out, he mixes it with Xanax and some prescribed pills because he says it makes it better. It’s not just Health I’m worried about for the guy he’s been getting more and more aggressive with our friends and well he usually treats me the same the others are starting to not want him around. I’ve tried talking to him about but no matter what he says he’s fine and just having fun and that he’ll drink less next time. We play on a football team together and he’s started skipping games to go to the club, we also had a trip booked to Europe come May but the other people we’re going with don’t want him coming now. I’m hoping this is the right place to ask for advice wether you guys have been on the other end of this and come out alright or had a similar situation I could use the assistance as I’ve never had to deal with this before.

Currently is on workman’s comp due to an unrelated injury but got a DUI during this time. He’s always had a drinking problem and occasionally takes Xanax when things get bad. He is a pretty big asshole when he drinks and my mom takes things personally and gets very upset when he’s drunk, but my brother makes her feel guilty when she yells at him and stands up for herself. All of his actions just piss me off and when things get bad I just run away from everything. I have this mentality that I shouldn’t have to babysit my older brother because it’s his choice and he’s going to do what he wants anyway. But I feel really guilty for having this mentality. I guess I’m looking for advice on how to understand where he’s coming from so I can help him out? Everything that my family does seems to be counterproductive, but they’re always there for him when he gets bad and I choose not to be bc I don’t feel like it helps. Any thoughts? Open to constructive criticism.",3.3822222222222216,5.2415253953488365,4.600426356589152,83.35417958656333,74.11627906976744,7.75452196382429,25.432816537467694,8.515128840125781,1.695552971576228,860,29,172,16,18,283,126,215,0.18,0.747,0.073,-0.9797,1,0,3,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,0,14,8,1,1,6,0,14,6,1,2,1,33,35,20,0,3,7,5,3,1,0,1,2,1,0,2,11,11,4,0,7,3,0,4,3,6,0,0,3,6,23,2,23,29,1,25,0,0,2,0,27,10,1,2,11,104,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518230099614444,0.0,0.13770231313676615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144283658506879,0.0,0.0,0.08762295864345811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12105956280536782,0.0,0.32275509355562504,0.07854624828901652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11099355010784637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275819845030285,0.0,0.0,0.25244944891646964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2316055712383112,0.0,0.1214690614909298,0.0,0.19545249947732588,0.09205103323286863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692768877204336,0.0,0.0732288757997079,0.1080739330205019,0.10305375098982428,0.0,0.14194367674911385,0.12758254430455068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17273194279605542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294998961686711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2164044307129128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860089057748254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2597025893592914,0.0,0.0,0.15090849305280926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11250754362402278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13108758055584951,0.0,0.12329280851792165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08254511827701347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11730092388346085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19375952335160146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25680822703761724,0.0,0.0,0.10229313794453036,0.07513393437908167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13413822109095508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10631539968976828,0.07599953691958779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Nuggetswoo,2019/02/17,"Sixth months sober, problems with friends in college This is my first post here and I’m on mobile, forgive me. 

My problem is pretty much what the title says, I’m coming up on my six months and I’m realizing that the college environment doesn’t welcome sobriety. I have noticed that as soon as my friends find out that I don’t drink they stop hanging out with me and generally stop talking to me. Usually this wouldn’t be an issue but I go to one of the biggest party schools in America, and the only thing any of my friends seem to do is drink. 

I guess I was just looking to vent, but if anyone has any advice as how to keep friendships together like this I would love some advice.

alcoholism,wdywtk,2019/02/17,"All the alcohol is gone. Mixed emotions. All the alcohol in the house is gone. It’s a good thing. I was just waiting for myself to finish it off, to sleep it off for a couple of hours, and then wake up, ready to start my life, alcohol free. 

But I’ve done this before. When the alcohol is gone, I panic. I don’t want to drink, but when it’s not even an option, it’s hard to do anything. My entire mind is focused on if I’m going to get more or if I can make myself do something else. Doing something else is always too hard. 

I’m just so tired. Not just physically, but mentally. I need to pull it together.

alcoholism,rgosskk84,2019/02/17,"Is this light alcohol withdrawal? Hey everyone,
So, I’ve been drinking heavily for a few years. I’m a former IV heroin/opiate addict that stopped that nonsense some years ago (3-4, can’t remember exactly.) I typically have been drinking every evening/night. I don’t drink during the day, I would just nurse my hangovers. Drinking rarely started before 4:00-6-00 pm and would continue for a good eight hours or so.

The last night I drank was on Valentine’s Day. I slept 9 hours the night before last, had a 3 hour nap, and ten hours last night. Very odd for me. I’ve been anxious and clammy and a bit shakey. Last night I slept from about 10-4 and woke up for an hour and went back to bed and kept falling asleep and waking up for hours and had just crazy dreams the whole time.

I’ve been to detox and rehab lots of times and have seen people in really bad alcohol withdrawal. Could I be experiencing a milder version? A little shakey, exhausted, anxious, gut a bit messed up... if it’s been over 48 hours then what should I expect? I’m 29 and back in school and trying to not fuck this up this time and have a test coming up...

Thanks",3.7027667881311817,5.050718464601771,4.318599687662676,87.77863872982824,72.31858407079645,7.6185320145757425,24.356064549713693,8.124751697461798,1.2043251431546067,887,25,186,13,17,282,134,226,0.113,0.8240000000000001,0.063,-0.8624,0,0,6,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,0,0,7,6,1,0,14,0,19,18,5,0,1,31,32,19,0,6,5,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,1,0,7,15,7,2,1,6,0,3,3,4,0,2,15,3,10,2,20,12,7,43,0,0,1,1,1,10,1,4,30,100,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917809521463225,0.0,0.0,0.07463051417827052,0.17994980675223876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902244264697324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12947583710967422,0.07029622498782404,0.0,0.0,0.1432812031926923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18383020459986374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07252335649879171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06721990823273406,0.0,0.0,0.10859285657215684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32990171706199656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07093480760773413,0.08044840213941154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783350703080892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07061567419959766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5803803510432178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745086095104814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08438180784335086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07157643882359349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950391934959457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058367651862072385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05393510734832853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09537233914537224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0852060978264677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059591040692812985,0.0,0.0,0.07038770280565494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07751204437528329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14727788514296106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057160371247469935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06946664581429163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07804618541652329,0.0,0.0939965880432214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11961417839020065,0.0,0.0,0.10843288326268262

Anyways, I had to sit out front at this party because I was fucked up and couldn’t stand up, when two cholos tried to rob me. They aimed a gun at my right lung, and told me to hand over my airpods and wallet. I was so drunk I didn’t even care and told them to kill me. Obviously they didn’t, but it got me punched in the face and my airpods stolen. I told my friends and someone snitched, and the campus cop found a gun in the thief’s car. I can’t help to feel this is all my fault.",2.361614100185527,3.3446405850340133,3.1878045763760063,96.00968460111318,75.12244897959185,6.705998763141621,22.88744588744589,6.980632752743323,0.338719727891156,534,14,131,5,11,169,90,147,0.217,0.645,0.138,-0.9454,0,0,1,3,0,1,16.0,0,1,3,0,6,8,3,0,8,0,9,6,3,0,3,20,20,13,1,2,4,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,4,8,2,0,3,1,0,2,5,5,0,1,11,3,22,3,18,7,2,22,0,0,1,1,11,15,1,2,2,81,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19073224440112466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10879484798902883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18196405388882397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14249533463872416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11787904386783687,0.0,0.0,0.17053760240665894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09024078354223518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19568528810230595,0.13788699064929613,0.16499444765769064,0.09324423096156943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28548065420980634,0.0,0.0,0.176715295969242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196259902204284,0.18856542052659075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19745277672656047,0.185851078388528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3374273717061104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17621952574050612,0.0,0.0,0.1524140754494473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512187093336507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5116128072199768,0.0,0.12117074305994853,0.0,0.17434116822801446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14166273165401605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,mcg037,2019/02/18,"Advice for support? My dad told me today that he’s decided he’s an alcoholic and he wants to quit drinking. He’s incredibly high-functioning, but I can’t remember many times in my 29 years of life that he didn’t have a drink in his hand. He told me that he doesn’t know what his road to recovery is going to look like, but warned me to be careful, since it’s hereditary. He told me his grandfather died of illnesses caused by alcoholism and that he couldn’t ever stop drinking. He told me he is scared because he knows this is going to be really hard.

I told him that I’m proud of him for taking this first step and I’ll give him whatever support he needs.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to best support him moving forward. Any insight y’all can give is much appreciated.",3.4912962962962983,4.692155969135803,4.898456790123458,83.98805555555559,72.64197530864197,8.609876543209879,27.08024691358025,9.075114841892004,2.052076543209876,625,22,131,13,12,209,94,162,0.112,0.7090000000000001,0.179,0.9226,0,0,5,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,0,4,2,8,0,1,2,0,13,8,1,2,1,18,36,6,1,3,2,1,2,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,10,3,5,1,5,3,0,5,4,1,0,1,6,4,18,7,16,27,2,15,0,0,2,0,29,5,0,1,8,69,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21584256088712586,0.0,0.23605483797585566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751033981724163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06732356737922025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11590060069052033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126015566823135,0.11345292299960308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461991106081144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3245692414506747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09989984953798706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394072169744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.211889382425032,0.1255318811884125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12166277694780114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09893308881107543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668656217519716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12139053583115687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07800746501555295,0.05395570074713536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854845850645148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11196943853928824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11738088445170708,0.08118655170439779,0.08189030878647179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746717719887108,0.0,0.0,0.07075107918203795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12510767569390074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105703115393946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09135760923443577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09233329049448866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3759800673319048,0.0,0.0,0.08303759001784954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06439880457464625,0.0,0.10468477950522072,0.5276536517369451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514072990181094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112012830630332
alcoholism,extrathrowaway222,2019/02/18,"I don’t remember.. My boyfriend and I had a friend over at the house last night and we were all drinking and bullshitting. 
My bf went to bed and me and our friend stayed up talking and we went for a walk around the neighborhood, too. He was telling me about his shitty marriage and I was giving him advice (I’m divorced so I wanted to help). 
Then he left and after that, nothing. 

Based on what I saw around the apartment this morning, I ate some of the pizza we ordered and played games on my computer. 

I woke up at 4:30 in the morning to see my bf sleeping on the couch. And I had a text from him at some point telling me to call him. I didn’t. 

I don’t know what happened. I didn’t do anything crazy but I think I pissed off my boyfriend anyway. I feel horrible. 

This is not a rare occurrence, either. I blackout all the time. I set limits for myself but I never stick to them. 

I don’t think there’s a single night in the past 2-3 weeks that I haven’t gotten drunk. 

I hate it even more because I love the feeling of being buzzed. But I always push it more than I KNOW I can handle. My bf drinks with me too but he knows his limit and he usually goes to sleep after he feels like he’s had enough. 

I just want to cry right now. I hate not remembering. I hate waking up and feeling crushing anxiety all day. My heart is racing, my boyfriend won’t answer my messages.. I don’t know who I am or why I’m like this. 

I’m a girl in my early 20s, too. Sometimes I think that because I’m young, I can’t have a problem, but I think I’m wrong about that. 

Sorry for the long post. I’m just spitting out what I’m feeling right now.

alcoholism,thrwaway10019,2019/02/18,"Curious about seeking help. I have questions. I am 21M and have been drinking for a long time. I used to just drink a few beers here and there but now it’s something I feel I need. I know it’s not good for me but I also don’t feel like stopping it. I try to stay busy and not think of drinking but I keep finding myself there. 

If I know I should stop but don’t really want to stop what would you recommend I do? My mom won’t stop calling and guilting me for drinking as much as I do now and I feel bad for that but I feel healthy. The only unhealthy part about it is the fact I need to drink. 

My life’s a whole mess and to only my own fault. It’s a crutch right now and these problems in life are temporary. Should I seek help early on or let my problems work themselves out and see if the drinking settles out. 

Sorry my post seems all over the place.

alcoholism,drugsdontxpandurmind,2019/02/18,"My father is an end stage alcoholic Long story short, my father is dying because of his alcoholism. I've lived with him the past 7 years in an attempt to help him, or just be here for him for when he falls, make sure he eats, etc. He's 62 years old and looks 80, has cirrhosis (diagnosed around 8 years ago). 

I'm not here for support or anything, but out of curiosity. You see, he drinks only about a half a pint of vodka and is completely out of it for 12 hours at a time. About every 30-60 seconds, he shouts ""damn"" ""fuck"" or ""shit"" to himself, almost like some sort of verbal tic. Is this normal behavior for alcoholics? He does this literally the entire time he's ""awake"" and the verbal tics only stop for a brief few hours while he is asleep. For every 10 ""damn mans"" he throws out, there will be a nonsensical sentence thrown in there. It's almost as if he's psychotic. 

This goes on for days upon weeks until I can convince him he needs rehab or until he runs out of money (he now gets his social security checks so this unfortunately doesn't happen as much any more). 

Does anyone know if this is normal? He's been this way for years and years so this isn't new behavior.

alcoholism,Matrix_404,2019/02/18,"Tried stopping a number of times Hi all, 

I have been struggling with alcohol and drug dependence since 16/17 years old and have tried to quit a number of times but have been unable to due to my anxieties and traumatic childhood.

I have been stopped for 2 days this time the overwhelming, short tempered-ness, aggression... feeling like I’m going to hit 100 real quick is just too much. 
I am struggling to breathe properly and feel like I’m going to have a panic attack. The thought of drinking large amounts of alcohol feels like dehydration at the moment. It feels as if I am dehydrated for alcohol. 

I really don’t know how I’m going to get past this, my goal feels so far away.

alcoholism,sp0tify,2019/02/18,"How little alcohol use can cause withdrawals? For the past two years at university I have been going out with my flatmates probably 3 times a week, every week, non stop.

When we don't go out, we'd probably spend at least once a week staying in and binge drinking.

I'm trying to not go out this year, but I feel very 'off' to put it simply. I think I already had underlying anxiety, but since the start of 2019 I think this has been exacerbated by the lack of alcohol.

This is all happening even though I don't feel like I want/crave alcoholic drinks except for maybe feeling like I'm missing out on a Friday night.

alcoholism,Legend_I_Am,2019/02/18,"I cant just have 1 I've always had a strange relationship with alcohol. It's never been just have 1 or 2 but a race to see how drunk I can get. I've embarrassed myself countless times in many different situations. I've spoken to many close friends including my wife and they are all convinced that I am just having a pitty party and encourage me to get back on the horse when I announce a hiatus from alcohol. I've tried to stop but just find myself blacking out all over again. Should I begin to go to meetings? How do I deal with friends and family? 

I'm starting to get to the point where I'm finding myself in dangerous situations due to being so drunk.

alcoholism,SomebodyGetMeATaco,2019/02/19,"Alcohol is killing my mother I'm sixteen and my mother is forty-eight.

She's been a hardcore alcoholic since before I was born (she didn't drink during the pregnancy, obviously). My entire childhood I had to deal with her drunken rampages and then the hangovers that made her shut herself in her room and refuse to care for us. Hell, it was my big sister who got me up and cooked for me every day since she was nine. I probably wouldn't have made it to school most days without her.

About seven months ago my Mom's completely disgusting personality coupled with her addiction FINALLY got her kicked out of the house. Thanks, CPS.

Please don't get me wrong, it's a sad situation, but I've been praying for her to be removed for the longest time. I even went to CPS when I was eleven and she told them I was crazy (I'm still angry that they believed her then).

Mom's now been living with her parents in colorado for seven months, chugging whiskey and smoking all day every day. She won't get a job, she won't leave the house. Her dad is an alcoholic as well and her stepmom is too polite to tell her to get a fucking grip.

They had to take her to the hospital a few days ago because she was stumbling around and rambling like she was drunk, but she was actually sober. There was no alcohol in her blood. Mom gets sweaty and shaking when she has withdrawls but this was apparently different. She was acting completely demented, like telling her dad to ""feed the chickens"" even though they don't have chickens.

They kept her at the hospital for like three days because they didn't know what the hell was wrong with her.

She already has awful bone problems, skin problems and allergies, and now her brain is literally deteriorating because she won't stop drinking all the time. Her liver must be a useless hunk of meat at this point. 

I've never loved that nasty witch, but she's my mom, and I don't want her to die when I'm a college student. There's no way to make her take care of herself, especially from two states away. It just feels like I'm going to break down the next time I see her (maybe when my sister gets married, I don't know) because it sounds like she's literally dying to me.

alcoholism,ShibbleNibble,2019/02/19,"A little help.? My mom(47) is an alcoholic and has been for as long as I can remember.
Her drinking is getting worse. 
Her drink was red wine but had to stop drinking that because it was staining her teeth (trying to keep up a façade of sobriety) now she drinks vodka and white wine. (she always said she hated those drinks) she binge drinks til she's violently ill or can't afford it. 

I (23f) am expecting my first child, I would love her to be in our lives, she's good with kids and would make a wonderful grandmother. 
My fiancé (24m) does not think so and doesn't want her in our child's life. I don't know what to say to her or him, am I too numb to her behaviour to see his point of view?
We want to have a gender reveal party, wedding, ect. What can I do, make them alcohol free events? I don't know how to accommodate for her. My sister refuses to go to any event my mom will be at. (I have asked her to be godmother)

Tl;dr: mom is an alcoholic, ruins family events by being way too drunk and bad behaviour. I would like to have her there at family events and in my life but my fiancé doesn't. I don't know how to find a middle ground or help her.

alcoholism,victory-toyota,2019/02/19,"Do I have a problem?  
Female, Turned 21. Drank occasionally before then about once every 3-5 months. After turning 21 in beginning of the year that following September started drinking about every couple days. Gradually became almost every day. I usually drink a strong 90% liquor. I rarely if even ever get to the point where I am nauseous and very rarely have a hang over. When I do drink which is now at this point a year later, I admit I drink 5-6 days a week of strong liquor. Still rarely needing the throw up or have hang overs. I drink up to 4-5 shots of the liquor every time depending on what I’ve ate that day. I work early usually so I start drinking around 6 or earliest 4 in the afternoon. I take about 45 mins to an hour between shots. I only eat once I feel the liquor a good bit and decide it’s enough for the night. It does not influence my work what so ever. My husband has only told me once before he doesn’t like that I drink so much but he himself does drink about every weekend.  If I don’t drink liquor I usually go for a tequila cocktail or vodka, I have noticed that I sometimes look forward to drinking after a stressful day or look forward to it to relax at the end of the day. I have tried to cut back since my husband does not like it but I still find myself at least having a shot or two of vodka. I have went online to see the symptoms of alcohol dependence however I can only relate to some of those such as drinking more then 3 times a week and looking forward to it. To me I don’t think I have a problem but I also think I do since I do drink quite often. Then again when I look at it I know how to control it and only drink enough to feel it and then stop. I do not drink and black out or throw up. I stop in enough time. I’m just on the fence I suppose. if any one wants to comment please don’t say I need to go get help if anything I would like advice on what you or someone you know has down to cut back or stop completely. But the main point of this post is just to see what people think. Am I an alcoholic, or just enjoy relaxing with alcohol?",2.624621654666484,3.9559401247113186,4.065448308653719,88.59828386088846,75.00461893764435,6.849313951908709,24.05169134628447,7.39963492309942,0.935519005569896,1626,49,349,19,34,539,192,433,0.057,0.858,0.085,0.8924,1,0,20,0,0,0,34.0,0,2,0,6,27,14,2,1,25,0,25,26,0,5,2,62,58,35,0,10,23,2,2,3,0,1,4,1,0,0,20,9,26,5,10,26,0,11,7,5,0,2,4,10,44,9,54,53,9,81,0,0,7,0,12,25,0,18,53,230,64,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04983437602752458,0.0,0.1635031410458052,0.05106684410182796,0.0,0.0,0.040782853568928405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03468019439804873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04196677344638998,0.045398777723567284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842818853783291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679059713979936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055676295543445706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05347013299861058,0.0,0.05719827282624335,0.0,0.05642800069853971,0.0,0.1973358400893461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13388532992165336,0.0,0.0,0.6994168274789199,0.0,0.0521833931535695,0.0,0.0,0.045168837800256136,0.15808281374975935,0.0,0.03368350921538248,0.09226070421899113,0.21483886836127647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051571953153202864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04661098681805444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05328840156519521,0.0,0.05796635237160051,0.04277446304642134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034182692799126765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05022247571591774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056054019966489316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07474472139720739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17130094308412627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04070588887611913,0.0,0.03748918776154446,0.07562831768307746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04785790003595743,0.0,0.0,0.05806123555346389,0.0,0.1629327035058558,0.0345573709292064,0.1551442385792314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03535539377028034,0.0,0.0,0.05598017579428301,0.14462797132705008,0.0,0.04884171307125428,0.0,0.0,0.09759585007124502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05424234641546607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040555429178651896,0.0,0.0,0.08127715093884573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437167225689783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04321019769289156,0.0,0.05043804328785653,0.0,0.0721928890973342,0.0,0.08145368076955851,0.1279091176304366,0.058417709238546424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05300615166243205,0.038343934285814514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09803182806111788,0.0,0.0,0.089211531674912,0.0,0.0,0.04873050131518122,0.0,0.03462410031990544,0.11094173723360352,0.04981735645237239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16850033165131606,0.04207845507420202,0.030079773102135082,0.0,0.08181458028907349,0.0,0.0,0.047275391927536735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742538865404946,0.0,0.0,0.03622731292572463,0.0,0.0,0.06568171175462575

To start off my mom started drinking heavily when my brother was still living off my parents; not working and had his child and fiancé sucking off my dads money. Well now that that problem is solved and they moved out she stopped drinking for awhile because she had a surgery and all was good in the house, well now she is taking at least 5-7 shots of gin a night; I’m not at all educated on alcohol but I assume thats a lot. She will not admit she has a problem and every time me or my sister bring the subject up she gets defensive and tells us if we do not like it we can move out &amp; thats shes a grown woman and does not need to be lectured by her kids. My dad will not intervene at all with the subject and at this point I can not stand being around my own mother, it makes me so sad but every time I’m around her she either picks me apart, judges me for my views or anything in general that she knows will anger me enough to start arguing and then she’ll turn it around on me and tell me how ungrateful I am...

alcoholism,BlueAlpineMoon,2019/02/19,"I'm sitting at work drinking in my truck I stumbled across a subreddit about crippling alcoholism this morning and decided it was time to join Reddit. I've been tired of being drunk 16hrs a day for a while but always feel helpless. Counseling worked for about 4 months until I convinced myself I could control it. AA worked for the first few meetings until I had a major life event. Leaving the country for work (military) worked for two weeks u until I got home and had freedom. I'm currently 50 minutes away from walking into an interview for an important position and writing this post whilst sipping a Blue Moon in the parking lot. At 32 years old, I am a shell of my former self, but I'm not willing to give up and Amit that alcohol is more powerful than the smidgen if willpower I have remaining. Gotta pop some Big Red fun and walk inside, I'll post more later.",7.360119047619044,6.9035476309523816,7.353095238095237,75.59190476190479,63.76190476190475,10.323809523809524,37.714285714285715,9.725611199111238,3.665650000000001,694,32,125,12,9,223,119,168,0.046,0.8240000000000001,0.13,0.9441,3,0,3,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,8,2,3,0,0,12,0,10,6,0,1,0,17,17,12,0,2,4,0,1,0,0,2,4,0,1,1,5,6,4,1,2,2,0,2,1,1,1,2,5,3,10,2,25,8,6,30,0,1,2,0,5,9,0,3,16,79,15,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434851664351195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13371773003457466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15098571378922696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802420259561211,0.1283082309661156,0.0,0.0,0.10364010966877103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574277130904196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125624131243504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13669384920880465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15416091534531698,0.0,0.0,0.1285288315213208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16119816416619484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17016122290773014,0.0,0.0,0.1135092478248193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13662390333102867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827156340305035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16863071538823782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30781801198344383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16764822735562754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09370718387821224,0.18470440341436964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569834334339213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12890621495555435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584968316518558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348743248666772
alcoholism,lezendgender,2019/02/19,"Need objective advice. Worried about my tendencies Hi, I'm 22F.

In reality, I don't actually drink that much, but I'm concerned about the way I drink and the feelings around drinking when I do.

I'm a huge stoner. I smoke almost every night. It helps me sleep and unwind. But when I can't smoke, I drink instead. I recently started feeling that I can't stand sobriety at night. I have a sleep disorder that means I don't naturally fall asleep until 5-7 am, and sleep medications either don't work or work so well that I'm passed out for 20hrs and not lucid when I'm awake. So I use weed instead. But then, I've started to drink if I can't smoke.

I toss and turn and feel emotionally destructive if I go to bed without SOMETHING.

I know I have a dependency on weed, but honestly I don't really care about that. In terms of just weed, I don't think that dependency is inherently worse than how I was before it. I'm fine and don't even think about it during the day. But I'm concerned about this attitude when I'm now drinking to get drunk on off days, even if it's not alcohol itself I want.

Am I making a bigger deal than I have to be or not making it a big enough deal?

Any help or advice? I know harm reduction type advice is controversial but I'm open to that as well.",2.1321986166007925,3.8714070189393937,4.172885375494072,85.58911067193678,77.29545454545455,7.621607378129117,23.599472990777336,8.456263369488248,1.4191273386034258,999,32,215,20,23,342,132,264,0.12,0.7809999999999999,0.099,-0.7381,1,0,11,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,2,21,7,1,0,8,0,19,13,4,6,0,45,47,29,0,5,18,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,14,10,8,0,8,8,0,3,13,2,2,0,1,3,25,5,25,45,4,32,0,0,0,0,5,12,0,9,15,132,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.09678109490358336,0.0,0.0,0.2907397922455784,0.0,0.10598857220989892,0.09931005347662288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06744281971649417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828732463887262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439114453631355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10111615015991417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12792013537557248,0.20449141049646846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11366384804052088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5829260824237045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155921926038023,0.0,0.10247492258002852,0.0,0.13100911796271406,0.0,0.08355973383932608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15043851394045132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05181516600644859,0.0,0.0563637880420963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13295064966565015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090086497092245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324009875034632,0.0,0.0,0.10803132008756336,0.0,0.09990899925633356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07290548900907838,0.07353746257040193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18613919443984905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06353443910843044,0.0,0.09792395610603766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29774171815350803,0.0,0.0,0.07635023443340032,0.0,0.0,0.14039402283391805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1270954603179565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10787459114850834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856558895622737,0.0,0.0,0.05849634783346224,0.0787209876888267,0.0,0.0,0.17834157848679175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09560175467677813,0.0,0.14440205916150686,0.10071765208679437,0.1010684254535355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,yrexi,2019/02/19,"Today I am 33 days sober. I’m a 25 year old woman. It’s never too early or too late to quit drinking. I’m so glad I went through the first few days, weeks and the first month. If you’re struggling in the early days, it will get better! The cravings will become fewer and less powerful and time will keep on ticking, even without alcohol. 
I’m so grateful to not be drinking ethanol that ruins lives, families and relationships, and I’m excited for the future. 
You can do this.

alcoholism,4lphawaves,2019/02/19,"Looking for support to stop drinking Hello! 
I seeked help for the first time a little over a year ago. I go to counseling as well as get visits by helpers. Im 34, I got a job but alchohol is ever present in my life and while I drink less than before it is still a daily struggle not to drink. 

7 months ago I discovered cycling. It has been an huge positive impact and I now train / work out to block out the urge to drink. Yet somehow I keep buying the wine , keep making excuses to drink every day of the week. 

15th of june im participating in a 300km race. Its been my major goal for some time now. My counselor asked if I wouldnt consider not drinking until atleast then and see it as part of my training.  I want to do this ! I really do! But im scared , scared of how hard it will be. And scared of failing.  Looking for any words of support or inspiration.

alcoholism,CornWarrior,2019/02/19,"Looking for help never ask for it So I’ve been soberish since June when my step mom died. I have bad anxiety and I’ve been going through depression or whatever for a while now. I used to smoke weed a lot and drank. I stoped smoking weed because of the pannack attacks I would have after I got high. Anyway. I’m drunk again tonight. It’s 2:24 am and I smiled a lot of cigarettes again. ( I haven’t had a cigarette since June 2018) I just need to vent. If anyone reads this I’m not suicidal tonight but I do get weird thoughts sometimes. And I did get into another altercation with my brother and his friend. I just want to know if anyone out there has gone through some shit and I’m not the only one who feels crazy all the time and I need to hear that I will be okay. I’m 30 and afraid I’m too old to start over. I didn’t know where else to post this, I’m sorry if this isn’t the wrong place to post this.

alcoholism,elocin88,2019/02/19,"Trust problems Hey everyone. I know this is a silly question but,  I really need some advice, so, here goes nothing! - How can I work on gaining peoples trust back? I am new in my recovery and I have lied to my family about my alcohol abuse for quite some time. I have had a few lapses over the past 6 months but I am determined not to give up this battle. I'm 31, f, and struggling with wanting to be independent but also needing my family to lean on during this time in my life. The problem is that they dont trust me as far as they can throw me. My parents still think that I'm hiding my drinking from them and I dont know how to prove them wrong without feeling that I am under a microscope. Sorry if this post is all over the place, I'm not very eloquent with my words lol. Any advice would be much appreciated. 😊",1.6787500000000009,3.6757948511904783,3.606190476190477,87.90964285714287,79.65476190476191,6.5809523809523816,23.0,7.6454224807358475,1.0454214285714287,637,21,134,10,16,215,105,168,0.171,0.687,0.142,-0.6702,1,0,2,0,1,0,17.0,0,0,4,3,8,9,1,1,6,1,16,3,0,3,2,31,27,13,0,7,7,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,7,5,2,0,6,1,0,1,5,5,0,0,1,1,23,4,21,23,5,19,0,0,0,0,8,10,0,4,7,94,30,1,0.0,0.17259007546414254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2846857389693814,0.0,0.1556723699678416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11648883492729843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09905769427470368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200795810903222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3414383109925052,0.1426969638878548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13918985129460126,0.0,0.0,0.2746413803707378,0.0,0.07365297192346107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13973584534836306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16010815593989428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10288801583805456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11626899922157133,0.0,0.10708107507318293,0.21601859221359965,0.0,0.14068487368851482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397702004896548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16174455933385026,0.0,0.13905442561398446,0.10098627899430818,0.0,0.15218968875701258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13950750753396354,0.0,0.0,0.2787648698815008,0.0,0.0,0.16317895935448656,0.15493343855846795,0.0,0.0,0.09331719924483656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16306086348880086,0.0,0.0,0.11632884341147487,0.0,0.0,0.15228145269658794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933367206828086,0.0,0.0,0.16987772192589348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12018948597723775,0.08591742403760574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14041656957266058,0.0,0.10604638929086713,0.0,0.0,0.10347675814621046,0.15926261324163096,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Serrata7,2019/02/19,"Im a child of Alcoholic Parents, and I need some help, please. After almost 18 years of seeing my Dad and Step Mother destroy their lives by drinking away all their problems, I have finally decided tomorrow I'm going to confront them about it, but I need help. How do I get them to listen to me? What programs or groups are most useful for people who are likely to not be willing to admit they have a problem. Also is their any advice at all you can give that might make the process easier. Honestly anything at this point will help man, I'm just tired of coming home and not knowing if they're gonna be my parents or two sloppy drunks I can barely look at.

alcoholism,CharlyOwl,2019/02/20,"My husband is at the start of his sobriety journey. How do I support him? My husband has been struggling with his addiction to alcohol for over a year and has now been sober for 10 days. I'm incredibly proud of him and want to support him as much as I can. The one thing I know is a contributing factor to his drinking is loneliness. 

My husband's closest friends are 200 miles away or in another countries. His family are nearby but they're not the closest. I would like him to be able to reach out to others when he needs it but he's pretty reclusive. My husband doesn't have any social media at all (weird for a 32 year old I know). He's going to AA meetings but says he's the youngest guy there by a significant margin. Does have any suggestions on how I can have other support networks in place for him?

alcoholism,potholesofamerica,2019/02/20,"Mentally Disabled Alcoholic Parent(Advice?) I'm a 31/M and I've been dealing with my father's alcoholism/mental illness my entire life.

It started when I was old enough to remember things.  Some of my earliest memories consist of my alcoholic father.  I remember being 3/4 wondering why dad wouldn't come in the house, why he was in the garage for so long... why my mother wouldn't let me out there.

Soon after, my mother divorced my father and things only continued to get worse.  Between the ages of 7-11 I was dragging my father in from the garage and laying him on the floor.  Constantly hearing about my mother and all the bad things she's done.  As a child, you cannot hear these things.  I repeated them to my mother and felt the wraith.  My mother kept me away from my father only allowing me to see him during allotted times by the judge.

I was lashing out because I could not see my father and my mother consistently grounded me.

High school was a whole new level of turmoil.  When I was in high school, I was coping by playing video games.  I played this game called ""Starsiege Tribes"" and my father went on my computer.  Loaded up Starsiege Tribes and saw that I was playing a female character.  He couldn't wrap his mind around the fact that the hitboxes on a female character were smaller.  Meaning, that you were harder to shoot.  So my dad thinks something is 'sexually' wrong with me.

Anyways, after a solid night of drinking and going through my computer.  He loads up AIM, continues to 'flirt' with people on my friends list.  Whom are my high school buddies... now I spend the next 3 years in high school with people thinking I'm gay...

So, I turn 18.  Figuring now that I'm an adult, all that is behind me.  

It only gets worse because now you're an adult, your drunken parent can start having 'manly drunk' talks with you.  Telling you how the world really 'is' in their eyes.  This is the WORST thing you can do to the aspirations of a young adult.

During these years, 18-30, I've enabled my father.  I've lived with him, cared for him, bought him his beer, listened to his 'false sense of reality bullshit.'

I've tried getting him help more then once, I've enrolled him into different programs and different psychiatric treatments.

He continues to manipulate everyone around me.  Getting them to do his bidding, he says things like 'if you don't watch this movie with me I'm going to kill myself.'

My father is completely dependent on others and 'the system.'  He's enrolled in a government sponsored program for his mental disabilities, which basically lets him bask in their system.  They do his taxes for him, they do his social security paperwork, they do his stated funded assistance.  When their not able to do it, someone else has too.

The funny part about that though, is when you start talking about his problems... he suddenly turns into a genius out of self preservation.

This next part is why I've turned to Reddit.

During this last year I went 'all in' on helping him.  It's not working out, instead he's blaming his situations on others yet again.  He's been getting more intoxicated and doesn't eat during the day so he can get a 'better buzz going.'  During this period he's been talking more about suicide but more like murder suicide.

Then randomly in November at 3:30AM the police came to do a wellness check on him.  Apparently he was screaming at them and told them to leave.  Then he comes down drunk, telling me it's my fault he had to talk to the police because I was sleeping.  He proceeds to tell me that if 'those crazy cops' shot him, it would be on me.  So I call the police station to find out some more information, they had gotten a tip from the government run facility he goes to.  Saying that one of his co-workers, a 26 y/o female, that my dad maybe has a crush on sent them screen shots.  The screen shots say things along the lines of, ""People will be sorry when I come around.""  Just alot of cryptic alcoholic threatening bullshit.

He says things like, ""I'm going to blow my brains out infront of a bus full of children."", ""I'm going to run my car into a bus full of kids and take them with me."", ""I'm going to shoot up (x) and then kill myself.""

This has me fearing for my own safety, I'm starting to get weird vibes from him.  I think he definitely knows this because these things have completely changed my outlook on helping him.  I feel like I've seen something that has completely ruined our relationship forever and I've lost all respect for him as a parent.

My fathers sickness/alcoholism was determining factor in my 'divorce' from my previous relationship.  It was the most stable I've ever been.  This left me financially in the whole, so now I'm living with my grandmother... whom my father lives with.  I sleep every night with two firearms and a knife, whenever he's around me... I have my hand on my knife in my pocket and I won't turn my back to him.

I've given this the best shot I could, I cannot carry him anymore.

Any advice on how to 'get out.'  I cannot simply pick up and leave, I'm financially fucked.",4.099636884854276,5.9504188012422405,4.8878260869565215,82.07765886287626,72.16770186335404,7.728173275999364,27.08440834527791,8.423722925485528,1.9427677337155602,3966,142,739,67,78,1281,403,966,0.101,0.8370000000000001,0.063,-0.9914,6,0,9,3,2,4,140.0,1,8,13,5,37,30,4,2,47,0,64,18,5,6,6,96,127,42,5,9,7,22,3,4,1,5,6,8,0,8,45,49,8,2,13,10,5,16,12,15,1,2,34,19,129,15,124,80,24,125,0,2,8,2,133,59,1,10,51,492,174,12,0.049688576767559126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711020428656447,0.0,0.2124079092135578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033789936095840495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049277716434549715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17693347165261752,0.0,0.0,0.046684053521047916,0.038207448441451214,0.04148788610767374,0.12115878081923412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052145095775979984,0.04394550825154513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05546888467156014,0.10147518479121484,0.056830494634198626,0.05066081558457293,0.0,0.05256392574991875,0.12840692747395402,0.1562925821281555,0.05369569929543982,0.0,0.0793445707052121,0.0,0.0,0.03204502138168125,0.051226740829269236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382797409526504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05084866553858935,0.0,0.048675888593465805,0.0,0.05084381880000199,0.04150842999038504,0.0,0.0,0.051341582394701206,0.0,0.0,0.04494616241096324,0.041864768977411884,0.04747956445858013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055913463110139526,0.025124037388360942,0.035497529170991325,0.04770882590623789,0.0,0.045414458981081686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038389271152772235,0.045936288550549376,0.20768184432538744,0.0,0.1694349795042289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200527454560152,0.0,0.09991561685114668,0.2099948377883832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05733394627374404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10994609643636337,0.0,0.027307542322905914,0.04050282191155849,0.0,0.10522605666547827,0.05398678404476644,0.10161987249780613,0.03509651123671975,0.09710131496668284,0.0,0.13162777086804436,0.043972826830965615,0.0,0.0,0.054240951178762965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04991885396165942,0.0541254268052986,0.0,0.0,0.10014879700743733,0.0,0.050171297914232464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04798953707122845,0.1056887301938245,0.09325872659970502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05213980279926854,0.052916712597735206,0.033670265568172236,0.11337120505425315,0.0,0.0,0.16551985276129216,0.10761577304561708,0.0,0.103343408266039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04754525737768278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031831774626022866,0.0,0.0,0.10669387203522293,0.11257494253698523,0.0,0.0,0.15805740239600682,0.0,0.20114996974111185,0.07919072496404753,0.0,0.051836022244492366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05585204215649247,0.09944892252690804,0.05065124658450401,0.04210096984962663,0.07650538791977851,0.0,0.055622293627585376,0.14067932152711776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087024764027182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03735962590952715,0.15975118334371355,0.13029001862256334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29709794264525363,0.09551530096757392,0.048818774391442915,0.0,0.02897380869811323,0.0,0.0,0.04747956445858013,0.0,0.03373528198133174,0.2161876123564008,0.04853851946931652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044675997872211055,0.09212361694415176,0.17934484787601182,0.1109510429592077,0.0,0.0,0.05388514193164107,0.07234775134975233,0.0,0.10127380948003184,0.03529733930076027,0.05432665845186682,0.0,0.0959934430029792
alcoholism,AwkwardAccount100,2019/02/20,"Numb lips etc - question/help please Hey guys, not a very interesting title! 

This isn’t my normal account because some Real Life people know me on there. 

Getting to the point, I’ve probably been a heavy drinker/alcoholic for about 10 years now (28yrs, now 38yrs female).

You’ll all laugh at this but it’s never really caused me any issues. My industry is very drug and drink friendly. Late to work because you had a big night last night? Hilarious! One guy even got a certificate for ending up in the hospital after a work party. 

But when I think about it - I have had issues with digestion and err, toilet things. I just chalked it up to undiagnosed food intolerances. 

It still didn’t put me off the wine. 

The thing that has scared me is, about three weeks ago I started getting numb little toes not just in the morning - all day. Now numb fingers and for the last week a numb mouth/lips/lower cheeks. 

Of course I’ve done online sleuthing and discovered alcoholic neuropathy and it all pretty much says it’s irreversible. 

I know you aren’t doctors (unless any of you are?) but could stopping drinking within a month of the first symptoms be considered ‘early’ enough to reverse the damage? When it says vitamins is a good multi vitamin enough? 

I can’t imagine never feeling my lips again or feeling the cat’s fur when I pat it. 

Yes I know I need to go to the doctor but it’s on my mind now. 

(Also I posted this to crippling alcoholism but got no replies.)

alcoholism,neonmaze,2019/02/21,"How the fuck am I supposed to stop drinking and taking Klonopin when I just got hit with a DUI and HSV-2 I just need to vent. I’m a 21 year old female and I’ve been a sugar baby in multiple sugar relationships for over a year now. It’s been great for my life but also harmful in some ways as you can imagine. I’ve been able to do things I never thought I’d be able to do, or at least at my age because of financial income. I’ve basically been living my dreams. But it’s also taken a toll on my sexuality. Sometimes a simple hug is even too much. I find vanilla dating hard now. Last week I found out I have HSV-2 and I’m not taking it well. This has caused me to feel even weaker in my sexuality and a stronger urge to drink, take pills and numb the pain. I usually drink daily, sometimes I can go a day or two without it, but I often wake up and have a beer on my bedside table readily available and drink it. I sometimes stay in bed and drink all day as I don’t have a job therefore I can do this. Even when I was working I would drink before going into work. Sometimes while I’m driving. It’s almost like I can’t function without it. And to top it off I’ve also been addicted to klonopin for a long time now and heavily rely on this medication to function in society or even just to sit with myself as I struggle with crippling anxiety. I’m not sure if I’ve contracted the STI from sugaring or another partner. And prior to finding this out I was charged with an aggravated DUI. This is honestly just too much for me to handle at once. All of this is embarrassing and few people in my life know about this. I appear to be fine on the outside, actually better than fine. People in my life see me as doing the best I ever have. I appear to live a healthy lifestyle; I am very into holistic healing and health and promote these things, travel the world, those sorts of things... my appearance also gives a false perceptive; I’m in shape and am often complimented on beauty. But really, I feel like like a disgusting, mentally ill addict.

More on weekends. I am starting a tapering process and I can already feel a little anxiety regarding the whole process. I am worried about any potential health effects. Any potential advice would be great.

alcoholism,iruinfun,2019/02/21,"Question about alcoholism. So, about a month and a half ago I made the decision to stop drinking. I made it fifteen days or so, and then I went out. Had two tall PBRs (so technically four drinks). Didn't have anything for a couple days, then I had a manic attack (I was unmedicated at the time) and got blackout drunk.

Since then I've gotten drunk maybe three times, tipsy about four or five times, but more often I've been able to stop at one or two. And go a few days with no drinks.

So, to get to the question: should I even be worried as long as I can stick to these small limits? Or should I be trying harder? Things like that?

I'm hoping I can get some insight here, and I feel like asking random people will be better than asking friends of mine.

alcoholism,kohlio412,2019/02/21,"Wake up call Hi guys,  just looking for some feedback / advice. 35 y/o m. 6-1 205 lbs. I have for the most part been partaking in binge drinking 1-2 times a week for about 15 years. I always thought of myself as in “good shape” but had a scare recently. After a recent two week period of traveling and heavy drinking I felt like my heart was beating very hard and felt very short of breath at times. I went to the ER and was diagnosed with hypertension and some slight heart thickening.  I now realize that I have been very reliant on getting wasted for the greater part of my adult life and I need to make a lifestyle change.  How does one adapt to a non alcohol lifestyle.  It seems very daunting and scary at the moment.

alcoholism,Tnubls5361,2019/02/21,"Want to quit/cut back on drinking So I’ll just start off by saying I’m 23 and have been drinking heavily since I was 19, I never noticed a problem until I’d spend $100 on a single night out alone and have no recollection of how or when I got home. I’ve made some not so smart decisions when drinking, thankfully I’ve stayed out of legal trouble, but I just don’t like the person it makes me sometimes, mostly with hard liquor. I realise admitting you have a problem is the first step, and I’m not comfortable talking to my family about this (even though they obviously know I have a problem) when I started hiding my alcohol/acting sober when stumbling in the door after driving myself home, I just feel so bad about it and wonder why I do this to myself. I just want to be a social drinker, you know go out with friends every here and there on the weekends and have a few beers. I just take it very overboard and I don’t like a lot of things about it. Aside from the blackouts and money, I’m tired of being hungover almost everyday, feeling like shit because of my weakened immune system, and especially the weight gain! I just thought I’d come to reddit to see if anyone has been though a similar situation and found a happy medium? Or quit all together? I’m open to any tips or advice! But please don’t bag me for having a problem, I hear it enough and am well aware. Just looking for some understanding.

alcoholism,1ncognito,2019/02/21,"Is it just me or do BAC calculators seriously underestimate BAC? I’m a daily drinker, 6-8 oz of wild turkey or makers mark per night. Occasionally, if i drank particularly quickly and I’m feeling more inebriated I end up trying to figure out my BAC. Tonight, I ended up drinking 7oz of bourbon in right at one hour and I’m feeling pretty drunk; however every calculator I pull up shows a BAC of sub .06. That said I wouldn’t feel at all comfortable driving right now. Am I just a lightweight or are these calcs giving wrong info to people?

alcoholism,backg643,2019/02/21,"Wondering if anybody else has experienced this symptom progression I’m 22M and I have had a drinking/drug problem for about 4 years. 

When I was 18 and started college, I became a little too enthralled with the party scene. Although I didn’t drink every night, 2-3 times on the weekends I would drink heavily (10-20 drinks) and consistently blackout. On the weekdays, when I wasn’t drinking, I’d often binge Adderall to get my homework done and get pumped up to work out. My sleep schedule was erratic, but my ego was thriving, and wasn’t feeling any immediate negative effects. My hangovers were very typical and mild: wake up after 5 hours of sleep very thirsty with a throbbing headache, chug water, take an electrolyte supplement, go for a run, and I’d be good as new. I also frequently experienced alcohol poisoning while drinking heavily and would vomit during the night (which I found made hangovers much better).

Around 19 and 20 I started experimenting more with with Xanax. I’d drink a lot, still 2-3 nights a week, but not quite as much as before, supplementing with .5mg Xanax to get that “perfect” feeling. I did this religiously every time I drank. Cocaine was around sometimes too, but not always. Around this time my symptoms started to get a little strange. My overall mood shifted to persistent grogginess and I felt physically weaker and less driven, and my thoughts were always tainted with fog. I started forgetting things left and right, and began balding. Hangovers themselves became strange too. I stopped getting headaches and feeling thirsty in the morning, but instead would just be incredibly groggy until I could finally pull myself out of bed in the evening. I noticed that I’d also never vomit when I’d drink, no matter how much anymore. There was no energy to work out or do anything productive once I was awake like there used to be. I started trying a bunch of crazy things like supplements, exercise routines, mindfulness meditation, etc. in attempts to compensate for these symptoms because I didn’t want to give up the lifestyle, but nothing truly helped.

Eventually I tossed the Xanax habit, but when I turned 21 is when the really concerning stuff started to happen. There was a period of about 4 months where I was going out getting hammered upwards of 5 nights a week, and weird things started to happen when I drank:

On random occasions after having only a few sips of alcohol I would break out in hives on my forehead. Taking an Advil or Benadryl would relieve it.

My hangovers became feverish. Id have no headache whatsoever, but wake up with a flushed face and a very warm sensation throughout my body. Small tremors and shakiness would occur for the first few hours of the day, and I’d feel generally uneasy, like I have the flu. No amount of pedialyte or Advil in the world relieves it, and the feeling sometimes lingers for up to 3 days after drinking. Palpitations are common too, and I have even had a few episodes where I went to the doctor because I thought I was having a heart attack. They told me it was a panic disorder, and all blood tests show that I am a perfectly healthy 22 year old.

Now, whenever I start drinking, even a little bit, my extremities get very sweaty and bring “buzzed” feels like I’m lightheaded. I also sometimes get palpitations. It’s a very different experience than I used to have 4 years ago, and my tolerance in general is much lower. 
Similarly, I used to drink a ton of coffee every day, up to 6 cups, and wouldn’t notice a thing. But find now that I’m extremely sensitive to caffeine, and it’s a very different, less organic experience. Drinking coffee especially after a night of drinking used to cure my hangovers, but now it accentuates it and induces a feeling akin to a panic attack.

Sometimes after as little as 4 drinks I will sporadically black out and exhibit extremely concerning behavior. I will remember having fun, being slightly buzzed, and then the next moment have no recollection of the night. My friends say that within minutes, my level of intoxication changes dramatically and the expression on my face becomes as if my soul left my body. I’ll be awake, standing straight, but it looks like “lights on but nobody’s home”.  Some of my friends have expressed concern that I look like a zombie. I stop being communicative, and my personality changes entirely in a way that’s not typically associate with being drunk. I go from loud and fun-loving to reserved, bank-faced, and zombie-like in a matter of minutes. Sometimes they say I look like a confused animal. I stop communicating with words and only answer in yes/no nods, but am somehow still able to do complex habitual tasks, like order an Uber home, microwave food, and get into bed on my own. It’s like the higher-level parts of my brain shut down in one instant and I’m left functioning off of low-level habits and impulses.

Sorry for making it so verbose, but I am trying to paint the best picture I can. I’ve toned down my drinking significantly (4-8 drinks a night), typically drinking only once a week, and have kicked hard drugs completely for the past 6 months, but the symptoms described above still persist. I have gone to doctors who keep taking blood and urinalysis and say that I’m very well and healthy, and my peers insist that it takes years and years and years to develop serious issues from alcoholism, but yet, nobody can relate or give advice to what might be behind the things I describe. I’m hoping somebody has been through the same thing and can tell me what’s going on with my body and mind.

alcoholism,jhunt42,2019/02/22,"Struggling with the balance between having a social life and not drinking OK so I've been a pretty epic binge drinker my whole adult life, with a few month or two months stints off the booze. Since late last year I've been drinking a lot less, off it for weeks at a time, a lot due to the fact I moved town and got away from a lot of my alcoholic friends. 

But wouldn't you know it, in my new town I've fallen in with some new people, who are lovely, but also love a drink. And wouldn't you know it, I've started drinking more. 

I have an issue where two days after even a minor binge I fall into a severe depression, like suicidal thoughts, the whole shebang. When I'm completely sober I don't ever get to that place.  

I'm not currently at the point where I'm a danger to myself but I am considering putting myself in self-imposed 'rehab' and just not leaving the house AT ALL if I think I might drink.

Honestly it sucks being lonely, and bored, but it sucks more being depressed and wishing I was dead. 

I feel like there's no way around this: I have to choose between having friends and being sober. 

Anyone else dealing with this?",3.640750773993808,4.919388013157897,4.131816305469556,89.32732198142416,72.37719298245614,6.592776057791537,24.815273477812177,6.794906146795322,0.8016137254901965,889,26,184,7,17,280,134,228,0.201,0.682,0.117,-0.9726,1,2,7,0,0,0,23.0,0,2,0,0,10,16,3,1,18,1,16,12,0,0,3,40,32,16,2,4,10,0,1,2,2,3,4,0,0,1,9,13,7,0,6,5,0,4,7,8,0,2,5,1,17,8,25,21,11,38,0,3,0,2,10,17,2,7,18,124,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107767075311078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828936413060748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0724786639492164,0.10620779018033434,0.0,0.09227578913749088,0.0,0.0,0.09738819542860257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10868131181364514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06684952504019122,0.10686475296756236,0.1785574691689337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5077169390254486,0.0,0.0,0.08659126161817804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06846379020807555,0.09376275876881786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052411572658960695,0.07405184527471219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601686897090968,0.0,0.054155965786621546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08290314790896093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196050716093654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818990142221424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139332199256848,0.0844934498662232,0.1169284484571836,0.10975670488958827,0.0,0.0,0.14643055336412805,0.10128214159987242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26437379531937066,0.18710711882590225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099626029518902,0.0,0.0,0.16547441173232352,0.110169891184179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2002231624001469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186199770144375,0.0,0.10829842600950068,0.0,0.09798839568486142,0.0,0.0,0.10545538590752028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042028792515023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10813578264603732,0.11710174096115335,0.0,0.0857452890665978,0.0,0.0,0.10566420713338448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336822867935601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10836372537571666,0.0,0.11338280651559135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641855976836546,0.0,0.08229126124603182,0.06044262935588068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025136406701094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822772837480552,0.0831465662478374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314563762087823,0.11919924927040823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06675104582070082
alcoholism,bedbugfucklove,2019/02/22,"Going through 1.75 liters of vodka every 3 days, how serious is this? Howdy folks. I’ve been really depressed for a while, keep in mind I’m 21, so who isn’t. I’ve been drinking pretty regularly for about 5 years. Anyway, I’m drinking about 3.5 liters of either vodka or gin a week. I don’t really wanna die young. How serious is this? Am I like, at a kind of normal level for someone who considers themselves an “alcoholic”? I don’t have a problem admitting it to myself that I have a problem, just trying to figure out how serious it is. Anyone else out there drink about this much? How does it treat you? Thoughts?

alcoholism,Chupacabrapenguin,2019/02/22,"Alcoholics Who Went Back to Drinking Are there any people here who tried being sober for an extended period of time and hated it so you went back to drinking?  How has worked out for you?  Is it any different than before you got sober?  I have a bit over a year sober right now and I absolutely hate it.  I have extreme anxiety, stress, depression, and negative and obsessive thoughts.  I've tried everything suggested to me: AA, therapy, medication, prayer, meditation...  Obviously there's a lot wrong with how much I was drinking before I quit, which is the reason I quit.  But I'm just not sure my life sober is really better than my life drunk.",4.469749999999999,6.575959808333337,5.511666666666668,76.92000000000002,71.75,10.133333333333336,27.833333333333336,10.355215969177356,3.2307333333333332,507,19,93,16,10,167,81,120,0.23,0.745,0.025,-0.9771,1,0,4,0,0,0,19.0,0,3,0,4,10,8,2,2,5,0,9,8,0,3,2,16,16,8,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,6,6,5,0,2,4,0,2,2,6,1,0,5,0,12,2,11,10,3,11,0,1,0,0,6,3,0,1,6,62,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1511283673777311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19233249439230535,0.0,0.10818118558167597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174769979518934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24066549117490674,0.0,0.0,0.12506903232051045,0.1543872660788287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12179951634247065,0.0,0.0,0.1477473439784059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4155951217274879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127093623409465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131015506164731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2792337414119131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19976952698223147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12022497314504235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245954662027654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395542931738903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09803853744318676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3008220100509326,0.0,0.0,0.090593314491505,0.14539695986661225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12076662999686005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16198905354414944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332808522153223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16171902802732252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11226677736449944,0.0824595359273197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920214028843944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26218405665305583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10295094552194968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546138131544528,0.0,0.0910658639390034
alcoholism,daniel24561,2019/02/22,"Liver ultrasound test results worried Just got my liver ultrasound tests back and from what I see is that I have mild steatosis and mild-moderate fibrosis (scaring between stage 2-3). For the past year and a half indeed I have drank heavily after 2 years abstinence almost. I am scared as hell because I am only 25 years old however I believed everything would turn out to be fine as my liver enzymes went down to normal as well as my GGT as I stopped drinking 3 months ago 

The doctor mentioned that it is also due to being overweight. I am 92 KG for 175 CM. I started exercising  recently after many years of not doing any.  I do have slightly elevated cholesterol 

He told me that this is a warning sign however that it is reversible.

Anyone else had this at an early age? Any advice? Any people overweight with fibrosis or liver scarring?

alcoholism,saddymcfatty,2019/02/22,I’ve been drinking too much and I need help to quit. I find myself drinking when I’m bored or when there’s nothing to do. Other times I just want to get a buzz. This has been going on for a year now and I need the courage to stop. My dad was a really bad alcoholic back in the day and I don’t want to be a spitting image of him. Any tips on how to get started? What’s the best feeling after not touching alcohol for so long? How do I avoid it if I go to a bar with friends? I know the first step is for me to want change and be willing to make it. I look forward to reading your responses and in advance thank you. ,0.21650452488687572,1.8640102205882376,2.3723529411764694,96.68712669683259,82.82352941176471,5.361085972850678,22.226244343891395,6.297961479604792,0.18005158371040775,474,16,116,4,13,160,89,136,0.076,0.765,0.159,0.8536,0,1,4,0,0,0,10.0,0,2,0,4,10,7,0,1,9,0,11,6,1,3,0,23,27,12,0,6,4,1,2,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,5,6,5,2,3,4,0,5,2,3,0,1,3,3,15,4,20,21,2,21,0,0,1,0,6,5,0,2,13,81,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3754399497849205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11945027808077767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350665573365832,0.14666318156059807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843373178724758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1858179172057699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132818571863913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.344146754928855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08881559420649507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16054394831619884,0.1494106205967848,0.0,0.0,0.1357093159783011,0.0,0.18354321525374315,0.0,0.19965565448230616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177367148967084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09653446857436504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554476569017042,0.14750454576495708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11724995219609985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291253979646357,0.26048941578404994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16854409380452193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18682892283458044,0.17570084997584912,0.0,0.11252801189378793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12432832093087272,0.0,0.0,0.1468540371550148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16171797332380766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10242486094772216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310814629850422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311497628676738
alcoholism,TRoberts309,2019/02/22,"How can I confront my father? Long post, my dad and I never had the best relationship, as far as I can remember I never seen him actually hit my mom, but throw things, scream, shove, etc I have.... Growing up we had the best life, me and my siblings. From going to Summer vacation in Florida for weeks at a time to being spoiled, my dad Owned a huge steel building erecting company. When I hit around 7-8 years old is when it got bad, him coming home late every night, a DUI on a four wheeler, him cheating on my mother.... It got to the point where he even cut the main breaker to the house one night when it was 22°F because my mother wouldn’t let him in. Then came the drugs, mainly marijuana, possession charges, etc. I’m not sure of the full extent. I do remember we sent him to a Alcohol and Drug rehab type facility, and he left there drinking a beer.

My father hasn’t had the brotherly relationship with my uncle (more like my father, to me.) since they were kids. Years ago, my uncle told him he had a problem... my father looked in his eyes and told him, he didn’t have a problem, you (uncle) have a problem for thinking that. My dad uses his mom, her SSI Checks, uses her house as a place to sleep, even if it’s only for a few hours then he’s back on the roads. 

I’m not sure exactly where the crossing line was between him and my mother, but when they crossed it, our relationship with him began to fizzle out. 

I remember as a kid, he picked me up from his brothers (my uncle) I was probably 9-10, he just pulled into the store, got a beer, cracked it open, and we set out, him taking me to my moms, we ran through a roadblock, and I seen him get arrested, for yet another DUI. 

We’d go to his house (different houses for a little while) he settled down with another woman, they were together for several years, moved to Maine for work, Arizona for work, basically thought they were gonna get married. My best friend’s mom (To this day I still claim him as my brother).... we traveled up to Maine for Summer Break to hang out with them for the break, there in his roommates room I found A spoon, needle. I found a ton of marijuana, seeing that as a kid, knowing what it is will scar you.

The woman that he was with eventually gotten strung out, on meth. They split, and it was hard on him, right back to where he was, coming home at 5-6 am, passing out in his vehicle, etc.

When I was roughly 12 I came across a mirror and a razor blade. I put two and two together and that’s when me and him kinda fell off... 

It was an off and on relationship for the next 6 years, not the strongest but he was my dad, I loved him..

When I was 18, my dad came to my high school graduation. He came with his best friend who’s niece was graduating. His friend (known user - molested my best friend from above in this story - as a child) this was the first time since he was molested that my best friend seen him. It wasn’t good, exactly as you would think there was a fight. And my dad jumped in protecting his “bestfriend” that was pretty much the last straw between me and my dad, embarrassing when your family gets in a brawl, infront of a couple thousand people and your whole graduating class.


Since then, not exactly sure if the count, but I’m pretty sure he’s had 6-7+ DUI’s and that’s since 2012.

Just last year (2018) he passed out behind the wheel, unresponsive in the middle of the road with his truck still running, when the Sheriffs officers got there they actually thought he was diabetic and in a coma - he wasn’t moving. They called the EMS to the scene, turns out he was just drunk. Somehow, he got out of it, he was dating the lead detectives daughter or something, not sure. Well fast forward to around 3:34am this morning.

I wake up to 6 missed calls from my deputy friend, and 2 from his number.

Turns out he passed out behind the wheel again, truck in the middle of the road, still running. Covered in urine, beer in his lap.

The deputy who found him is one of my good friends, noticed the name, knew it was my father and called me. He told me the same thing, thought he was dead. Wasn’t moving, anything.  They saved him. Wrote him an open container ticket, took him to his moms and parked his truck in town.


He’s my dad, I love him, but he has a problem. A major problem. I have to get through to him before he kills himself or kills innocent people. 

Reddit, I’ve never asked for help before, not to this extent, and I’m not sure it’s even possible. He may be too far gone.

Help me.",3.9390480111703847,4.762473084350724,4.7719202678027965,86.73381466828972,71.20865704772476,7.899473703053952,25.853012781497263,8.103011114424296,1.3322741255236117,3463,102,744,47,62,1122,360,901,0.128,0.7959999999999999,0.076,-0.9933,1,0,9,0,1,0,161.0,7,5,9,10,35,43,8,1,60,0,53,18,4,5,12,121,111,54,3,9,19,25,2,1,7,5,7,1,3,6,30,56,6,2,14,7,2,32,16,17,1,7,61,9,119,26,111,39,24,149,0,1,6,2,146,66,0,7,50,479,149,9,0.0,0.0,0.09102523250475072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0413423687930316,0.04984255674036296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097809428378203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03837965325924205,0.08303661226897566,0.04360086264798995,0.0,0.0,0.07172452001051836,0.038941343098112,0.028430501622725923,0.0,0.07937214969940938,0.0,0.29366645389832385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14286989616595994,0.21336886475653988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08035017267386148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0516048035879803,0.0,0.03007808517820755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048727485800701666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0456881431221686,0.10817210565640388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560433432760295,0.09241320917074708,0.0,0.03929509274686934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04396678931273389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039670830656003866,0.0,0.15341069004013588,0.25223045656188176,0.0,0.09746712491128492,0.0,0.053011664276907705,0.0782366107877722,0.18650603297840065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041779089425566115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06252183760438831,0.04927631770588856,0.09356478158614798,0.0,0.045929697365462666,0.21525906306435086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10319756115110006,0.0,0.025631394475068348,0.07603348507110352,0.05261045355724429,0.0,0.05067305369077546,0.0476912020806903,0.032942273367913444,0.0227852993737854,0.04674420185487969,0.0,0.04127375716792118,0.03916473830748755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08418644491656345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2731132453859648,0.0,0.14870858255698902,0.03428479030194459,0.0,0.10791185730064784,0.0,0.049600756873947625,0.0875344687359335,0.0,0.0,0.053098437295679375,0.04893944089136582,0.0,0.06320714245560101,0.03547081174495335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06466676574412941,0.0,0.048727485800701666,0.0,0.044088620077901694,0.05257809519438052,0.044666955744327726,0.09489659284550303,0.050284376717799235,0.22313455250856112,0.0,0.046884747140040366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200289919163714,0.1584975714431063,0.03982917113711816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04720082607688378,0.037164983328022684,0.0,0.0,0.05268842429364089,0.0,0.15431996602067585,0.0,0.04667235398312549,0.0,0.0,0.035904728335715334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117371113346896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26373837900368896,0.0,0.035066477158760816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06196932274140034,0.059768355778913415,0.0,0.11107768815225652,0.05439076951011966,0.0,0.0,0.1336957495206181,0.05181728075341085,0.0,0.10145896520834187,0.0911184115393835,0.0,0.0,0.08056167653997612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03741072955079856,0.0,0.04193376728997777,0.0,0.0,0.052070411827619255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679070174936317,0.0,0.0,0.03313077452522078,0.0,0.0,0.15016887859131234
alcoholism,mcrhaegar,2019/02/22,"New to Sobriety and mostly alone in this Hello everyone,

I am new to sobriety (105 days) and noticed that I have not talked about it much to anyone except my girlfriend and even with her I am trying to not make it a big deal; don't want to tell her everytime I am craving or struggling.
My bad experience with AA and support groups in general made me afraid to try finding a good one, but also there aren't many around here.
Alcoholism seems to be a taboo, sobriety is considered weird, at least where I live; was surprised to find that out when I got sober.
I'm here to find some sort of connection to people who know what I am talking about.

alcoholism,Piper1123,2019/02/22,"New(ish) relationship Hi. My boyfriend and I just started dating after being friends for a year. Just recently, he went through a bender and is now just recently sober because his binge landed him in the hospital for a week with several complications and was told that if he keep it up that he won’t be around much longer. So he’s been sober and recovering from GI issues but since he’s been distant from the relationship and it has me a little concerned/paranoid. I’ve been giving him space and not hovering,  just being supportive, watching some movies here and there with each other. His friends who have been bad influences on him have disappeared which is a relief. And we’re considering relocating closer to his family to avoid some of his “friends”. I’m in no way trying to make this about me, but I won’t lie that I feel a little lonely in this situation. I want him be healthy and well and continue on together. But can someone give me some advice? I feel a little lost and don’t know what to expect/think/feel.

alcoholism,Wildcelt7,2019/02/22,"Where to go from here? From age 21 when I got my first DUI, back when I had to steal to hit a buzz because I ran out of money so quickly after becoming legal, to rehab where I got thrown out at 5 months in after relapsing on the premises, to the second DUI at 23 and my subsequent success story thereafter which neglected my ongoing dependence of alcohol just because I returned to school and had great grades. I am now on the precipice of getting married to woman who is aware of my addiction, but unaware I am hiding my nightly use, and also getting a career job using my engineering degree even though I can’t help but show up to my co-op at a minimum 2 days a week pretending I’m sick from a weak immune system when instead I’m sleep deprived and coming off a night of late night drinking. 

I have went through AA and I can’t relate to my sponsors, no matter the age because I’ve spent 5 year in the program and I’m apparently unable to accept the first two steps of our program, therefore I attempted paying for therapy which hasn’t helped me at all. Can anyone offer any advice because I know everything is hanging on by a thread and I sometimes think I should just go ahead and end this charade, but I’ve have 2 uncles who I’ve lost and I despise the decision to take the easy way out.",11.603218390804601,6.3153701647509575,11.31770114942529,65.57241379310345,59.99616858237548,14.05210727969349,45.475095785440615,10.746095033038511,4.85372337164751,1027,43,195,16,9,345,155,261,0.118,0.795,0.087,-0.8779,2,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,1,0,0,6,16,9,1,0,15,0,13,8,1,4,1,30,33,18,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,1,5,13,2,1,4,3,3,7,4,6,1,4,8,0,25,3,40,23,1,48,0,3,0,0,7,16,0,1,23,132,30,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15019680672819435,0.0,0.13463367756429362,0.0,0.14724126146813396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11017987973840092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09369279767594682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633658688051157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10594168412705944,0.0,0.3359492928830449,0.15216340596807693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186823224710402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885449490994574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349685944580973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202915395177742,0.0,0.0,0.09100013044074187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12382470452150884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343853739167633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439651510893306,0.0,0.15660320880642414,0.0,0.2203850312912911,0.15189916376189605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18469747220493232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13672199450083306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571840416124166,0.0,0.15541798123502348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15039941034893925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997195018331238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3878819559486323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394372525892168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13787607870841018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13626455869018075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10359084023308572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15755952441826054,0.0,0.0,0.0882816680794068,0.1353647884645809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13458769709506782,0.0,0.0,0.2379894543035731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093606347330126,0.11051606040590653,0.0,0.0,0.12772026823376184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08872359912120698

I straight up asked him if had a drink and he confirmed my suspicion.

I recently moved here with him 3 weeks ago. A year ago, before he went for help, I was skeptical of living with him because of his drinking. I was NC for work but it wasn't working well there. I'm from MD but can't return until I have a job or car( mother lives in shit area for work).

I suspect it's due to srress/ work. He hasn't been able to make his AA meetings, but he also refuses to use his off days and continues working.

alcoholism,rkg1989,2019/02/23,"Naltrexone Not sure if this is the right sub to discuss medication, but just wanted to share my story. It might possibly convince people that are in doubt about trying naltrexone:

I've had a habit of daily drinking for I'd say around 5-6 years, with the intake ranging from 2 to 6 beers. Not a hardcore alcoholic, but the habit was definitely there, I was aware of it, and I wanted to get rid of it. I had a hard time quitting, simply because I enjoyed my evenings much more after downing a couple of beers. I tried a couple of times to quit drinking, usually by allowing myself to only have one drink a night or only at social occasions. However, these 'regimes' never lasted for me. In the end I always got back to my original drinking, and it was just because I liked it too much. 

My situation now: 4 months ago I started the Sinclair-method ([https://cthreefoundation.org/the-sinclair-method](https://cthreefoundation.org/the-sinclair-method))and taking naltrexone. In short, the pill blocks the receptors in your brain that make drinking feel good. To me, that was exactly what I needed, and the results have been spectacular. Within a month, I completely got rid of my drinking habit. Now, I only drink at social occasions (let's say once every two weeks), and I don't drink anything at home anymore. The naltrexone just made drinking boring and annoying, by taking away the pleasure. Im not tempted to drink anymore during the week.

My life got much better, and I'd really recommend naltrexone to anyone with a drinking problem. Not drinking has allowed me to do more sports, have better evenings, and feel less guilty in general.

Just thought I'd share my experience, since I've turned to Reddit myself to get an idea of what naltrexone did to others.

Feel free to ask me questions!",7.110696874103818,8.781359646687697,6.817558072841988,71.84825853168914,64.5205047318612,9.170576426727846,32.705620877545165,9.457814108942452,3.1931274447949516,1436,58,229,27,22,451,172,317,0.066,0.79,0.14400000000000002,0.9831,2,0,18,0,0,0,64.0,0,1,0,4,13,15,1,1,20,0,18,19,1,6,3,45,37,11,0,5,12,0,4,1,0,1,4,3,1,0,13,10,15,1,6,15,1,0,6,4,0,2,13,7,26,12,43,22,6,33,0,0,0,0,10,14,0,5,20,155,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05784841856658377,0.06974232896957783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0543009528703944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12943934990641387,0.04563080937391335,0.0,0.05370283104230854,0.05809459935561896,0.061008622049498626,0.0,0.061313246391871815,0.05018036189250885,0.0,0.07956290875169213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11543306855426383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07285094451826743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06842311863461019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1444163150374201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7671510570937617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05780035646207762,0.0,0.0,0.08620628443673366,0.0,0.0549837621596752,0.0,0.0,0.06383610293220551,0.0,0.0,0.09899116584145727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06819056579191311,0.0,0.0,0.0547363919897691,0.15658143511234127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058459501063428475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06546038369720589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07366978929351048,0.07049122626913709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053195027255074266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06673204028822652,0.046094562889272266,0.03188239024082785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061749913300075135,0.043561079434472634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06574186393753258,0.0,0.06922978846675155,0.0,0.0,0.10417867723539542,0.0,0.14391924974957446,0.048388932874916,0.0503319836419044,0.0,0.0,0.061241418117451124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06949900861308017,0.044221380389137255,0.14889788064570822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045242571257118634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07357003836584411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062444322214833,0.0,0.0,0.0731053344056169,0.13882256488501718,0.0,0.0,0.04180676898281609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055731072755764895,0.0,0.10379360537743704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053983154861277236,0.07335417051319851,0.0,0.1330472453721683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0461908577580171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061506103730439465,0.0,0.09813372129162867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051808582698042116,0.07610642768273901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.088613541464993,0.07098336232361585,0.06374883882731157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187388258319058,0.0,0.07698323411774669,0.0,0.10469412397581992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04202483988236769
alcoholism,Treelo81,2019/02/23,I wonder where I would be... Me and alcohol have butted heads for 24+ years. It has been with me through a lot of life changing decisions (those decisions affected other’s live’s as well). I naturally question all of those decisions. I am at peace where I am now but can’t help but to ponder the serenity of having gone wherever with only sober decisions.

alcoholism,lisaemc2,2019/02/24,"I’m about to lose everything I’ve been drinking heavily &amp; steadily, moving from beer to whiskey recently, for over 20 years. I used to hardly drink until my fiancé died 27 years ago. I held it together for a couple of years but my decisions became erratic &amp; I ended up in weird situations. I found myself cheating on my SO for the first time in 15 years &amp; he caught me. I broke it off when I finally came to. I don’t know why he put up with me for that long &amp; when I realized he was willing to still be with me after finding me in bed with another man, I could no longer let him suffer. I lost what little respect I still had for him but I knew I was holding him back. I moved 1300 miles away 2 years ago &amp; tried to start over. I’ve been stopped by the cops, mostly for speeding, several times but I always manage to talk my way out of it. I’m positive the one exception is on the horizon. I wrecked my truck. Thankfully it was on my property &amp; no one was hurt &amp; no cops were involved. But no matter what happens nothing makes me stop drinking. I’m 2 years off my meds. The drinking has increased since then. I didn’t have to work when I was with my ex. I have 2 jobs now. I sometimes work 15 hour days several days in a row. I sometimes wake up not even remembering leaving work. I have to go through my phone to even know if I set the alarm. It’s going to catch up with me soon. I have a full day ahead of me. I’ve got to open alone then fire the person scheduled next for stealing then do 2 interviews for entry level positions. I just spent my only day off sleeping on the couch in my work clothes. I need help but I don’t know where to start.

alcoholism,erectile_dysmorphia,2019/02/24,"Meant to be? Hello everyone. This is my first post so i'll try my best. I (27M) caught my wife (28F) cheating with two different men after 5 years of marriage and 3 children. The cheating started when I lost my job as a police officer and the bank account started getting low. Each time I caught my wife, she says she is cheating because I drink too much and she doesnt like it. I drank probably 5 days a week and limited myself to two 16 oz. beers per day and sometimes would allow an additional 16 oz. if I was feeling like it. She says that I have been drinking since we met and she doesnt want me drinking around our 3 children. I explained that I was still able to function and take care of the children but she still insisted that its wrong to drink at all. 

So the first guy she cheated on me with was my best friend in the police academy, the second was some guy I went to high school with. After catching her with my friend from the police academy, I started drinking alot more and it lasted for a few weeks. When I caught her with the second guy, It picked up even more. The pain was so unbearable knowing that my wife wanted to be with other men. On Feb. 16th I went to my best friends house to vent to him. I told him everything that had been going on and he told me that I need to leave the house and get out of that toxic environment. He said that if I dont leave then the problem is only going to get worse.

On the way home I got some vodka and drank it. I didnt make it home. I was so wasted that I pulled over in a church parking lot and cried myself to sleep. A police officer found me and brought me to the hospital due to my unresponsiveness. He didnt arrest me for DUI. What an angel he was! When I got out of the hospital, I went home and packed a bag. I went to my mom's house and cried for hours. I fell asleep and woke up the next morning.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up and felt like shit. All I could think about was my wife sleeping with other men and confusing my children with these different guys coming around. I thought about the future and what I was going to tell the kids when they ask why me and their mom arent together anymore. This saddened me very much. I thought about what my future is going to bring and about how I'm gonna pay all the bills that I'm behind on. My wife never wanted to work and stayed at home to raise the kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

BUT...of all the things I thought about, alcohol was not one of them. I don't understand! How can one enjoy drinking, then drink all the time to cope with their problems, then just quit in one day? I havent had a drink since Feb. 16th. I can pass gas stations and liquor stores and not even think about stopping. Im just so confused. I am still sad and I miss the way my wife and I used to be when I was a cop. I miss how we used to play with the chidren and take them places. We were the perfect family and now thats gone. I'm sad all the time but I just dont want alcohol at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

After thinking about it, I've started to wonder if my wife was the reason that I drank at all. I do recall several times where i've been driving home from work and thought, ""shit, I gotta deal with my wife when I get home."" I love my wife but she wasn't exactly thre greatest person in the world. She frequently would tell my that I was a bad husband if I didnt do what she wanted me to do. She would not have anything done around the house when I got home. She spent so much money that I would have to take extra shifts to keep up. She complained alot when I played my playstation or wacthed something other than what she wanted. I also never got over the fact that she kicked me out of the house when I was in the police academy because we had no money.

&amp;#x200B;

So im wondering...is it possible to love someone yet drink to deal with all the emotional greif they cause you. I'm just so confused here. I always thought alcoholics had to go through recovery to stop drinking??? Any thoughts would be nice.

alcoholism,MWillower,2019/02/25,"I’m withdrawing and I can’t stop eating. Hey reddit, I’ve been sober for 5 days. Besides the night sweats, sweaty palms, pale skin, depression, and anxiety, I’ve been mostly okay. But I’m a relatively healthy eater and ever since I stopped drinking it feels like I can’t stop eating, it’s gotten to the point where I’m running to the kitchen and grabbing blocks of cheese or whatever I can find to immediately put in my mouth. I read that a reduced appetite can be a symptom of withdrawal but I can’t find anything on overeating. Is it possible I’m confusing alcohol cravings with food cravings? Or could it be something unrelated?

alcoholism,Alliesmith94,2019/02/25,"Accepting the fact that I have a problem. Now what? Hi Everybody,   


First time posting here. I have started to accept that I have a drinking problem and I need to stop. I've been really struggling with finances and I realized that my drinking habit (going out, cocktails, craft beer, was literally taking almost half of my pay check). I tried to do a sober January and made it just 13 days, and fell right back into my old routine of drinking daily (usually at least three).   


I've noticed I'm much more motivated by booze than my friends. Can't go skiing with out Apres, can't go mountain biking with out beers in the parking lot. If we go out with friends, I need atleast three drinks, whether it is dinner or if it is to party. While it hasn't creeped into impacting my professional life. I can tell my relationship with Alcohol is trending in a negative direction. Right now, I'm struggling with my finances and when I check my bank account almost 50 percent of my pay check goes to booze/going out. I don't have money for paying off my credit card or starting a savings, but I do always have money to spend 50 dollars on fancy cocktails. I'm not keeping up my half of the home expenses and it's negatively impacting my relationship.   


I recently read this artcle about the famous Montreal restauranteur, David McMillan who owns Joe Beef and gave up drinking. It really resonated.  [https://www.bonappetit.com/story/david-mcmillan-sober](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/david-mcmillan-sober) Particularly his opening line: ""I was never falling-down drunk. I was never belligerent. I always got my work done. I was never unkempt. I was always clean, I was always shaved, I always performed at work. I was always kind and gracious in the dining room. But I lived in hell.""  


It made me realize that alcohol abuse comes in many forms, and that I definitely do not have a healthy relationship with it. So I am hear to say that I have a drinking problem and I want to stop, but am looking for guidance on how?   


One realization I have had is that much of my life is built around booze. My girlfriend and love to explore new restaurants and breweries, we have our favorite wine bar that we go to for date nights, our favorite pub that we go to for comfort food, drinking while we cook dinner at home is a common occurrence. When we travel to a new city, our favorite thing to do is explore the local joints, eating and drinking our way around the city. It's a big part of our relationship.   


Additionally much of my life outside of work involves drinking, even the mountain bike advocacy group I am a part of has a beer sponsor, our trail nights end in beers at the trail head, our meetings are held at the up stairs of a local bar. Drinking is just part of what we do.   


I'm looking for advice on ways to quit, specifically:   


1. For me I feel like the easiest solution would be to remove my self from situations that involve booze, until I am sober. But the reality is that I can't do it. It would remove me from my partner, remove me from my friends and remove me from organizations and social settings that are all positives in my life. 
2. Are there good online resources and community that I can use? Where can I start? I'm not really a person for support groups and have found online communities to be a huge help with other issues. 
3. What has worked for you? Specifically to get through that first 30 days?

alcoholism,holly2277,2019/02/25,"8 Years Sober Husband Told Me I'm Making Him Want To Drink Hi,

I'm so glad to have found this sub. Last night, my husband, who has almost 8 years sobriety, told me that he went to work yesterday morning and thought about having a drink because of an argument we'd had the night before. Some explanation- I moved country to be with him, and after just getting back from visiting family in my home country, I was feeling a lot of feelings about my move here. I told him it was nothing to do with him because our life here is wonderful, but I feel like I haven't got enough going on outside of our home. His issue is that he feels responsible for my happiness here and it gives him too much stress. We were talking recently and he said he's never come close to drinking again ever since he sobered up.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is- how do I deal with how he's feeling? I can't think of any alternative to this than not being in his life, as much as that kills me to admit. His sobriety comes first, always, and I can't/don't want to risk jeopardizing that. This might be slightly off-topic, but any advice or opinions would be appreciated. Thank you!",4.11958094742322,5.571059261061951,4.892935970848517,83.66093961478397,71.43362831858406,7.795523165018221,28.33836543466944,8.313332769828598,1.9077322228006248,907,34,179,14,17,293,141,226,0.05,0.8109999999999999,0.139,0.9578,0,0,3,0,0,0,31.0,4,1,0,2,14,7,1,2,4,0,21,5,0,3,2,41,48,14,1,3,5,2,5,1,0,2,2,1,2,0,10,12,3,0,11,3,0,7,4,3,0,1,12,6,29,4,28,29,5,25,0,0,0,0,33,5,0,8,14,119,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064680459783672,0.0,0.0,0.10910113739159824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09065799474778954,0.1180510126962324,0.13239036185073547,0.1481841582473436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08377847430691328,0.0,0.13283401823437235,0.0,0.0927113573336046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877074918291809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11232621819717696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201986927870567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11257803430977742,0.0,0.0,0.09855462917162576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271161182407818,0.0,0.2754506786879771,0.07783636324650221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09267574509694952,0.0,0.119461829344168,0.0,0.0,0.056923678394440985,0.10451807288439988,0.06192075391983549,0.0,0.0871400234657483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11598296873278564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21857837874683603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11371909012479996,0.0,0.0,0.12054084466742553,0.0,0.0,0.08881159991813634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15391408140816104,0.053229150027969935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262832316555417,0.0,0.0,0.07272727091924748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558238792216903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2316005397901331,0.16018663759663493,0.0,0.08403161394873797,0.0,0.0,0.2044908558157588,0.0,0.10454376946320207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12205279414522502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757838320536722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10363967677361448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012741602461008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480580372322145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757265242253345,0.0,0.10030969427400263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06981296853929216,0.0,0.08649686552167878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3123290588633851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285271301034508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010009355511204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11815536401919692,0.07931940596486423,0.0,0.0,0.07739740166744367,0.0,0.13239036185073547,0.1403248934664492
alcoholism,doubledoublechexchex,2019/02/25,"I’m 38F dating an alcoholic [40M]. I think I just need a reality check. Firstly, this is a throwaway account. I’m fairly certain he stalks my regular handle to read comments I leave. 

He takes deep offense at any suggestion that he has a drinking problem.... me crying at A Star Is Born led to a fight because he thought I was making too many comparisons between him and the main character. Well, I’ve seen him falling-down drunk twice in the past five months (since we started dating exclusively) - it takes about seven or eight whiskeys. I know there have been more instances when I wasn’t present, plus every weekend when we go out for a more normal amount - maybe five or six drinks total, with food - and he just falls asleep. Plus he has more than one failed suicide attempt in his past. Drawing a parallel between him and Jackson Maine isn’t a giant mental leap, but of course he took offense despite my backpedaling - “no of course I don’t think of you like that character!”

I know intellectually that I’m not going to fix this guy. I’m not going to save him, turn his life around, give him a family and something to live for, I KNOW. But I still allowed myself to fall for him. He was dealt such a crappy hand... his childhood, his past relationships... I believe this man has a good heart and deserves love. And I think that’s why he drinks - he’s so used to drowning the pain this way, he knows nothing else. Alcohol is his medication for everything from a cold to a bout of depression. 

So tell me, redditers who have been down this path with a romantic partner, or who have been on the other end with a romantic partner trying desperately to love you while watching you self-destruct... what’s the prognosis? Is there EVER an instance where love wins over alcohol and depression? Or do I just leave this guy and further prove to him that he’s unworthy of a relationship? I know I’m just enabling him... but I truly do care about him and I enjoy sending time with him. Help. 

TL/DR: I’ve been dating an alcoholic who’s deep in denial. He’s had a very difficult life and I want to know if I can expect to help him turn things around or if that only happens in the movies.

alcoholism,meovvth,2019/02/26,"My mom Let me just start by saying that my mom has struggled with alcohol for my entire life. To say the least, she put time through a lot when I was younger. But when she married my stepdad, domesticity and the chance for a stable relationship put her on the eventual path to a 5 year sobriety that I thought would last. She was sober through my high school years and for some time after I graduated. 

Last year my stepdad threatened divorce because of a multitude of reasons. He’s one of those people that doesn’t think raising kids suffices as a full-time job. He’s military so he works long hours and for as long as I can remember he thinks that bringing in income is the only role he plays in the family. I have two younger siblings and my mom has been a housewife for the entire time that they’ve been married. But even when she got a job working long hours, he still wasn’t satisfied. And yet during his time off he sits in front of his computer and games for hours. Very seldom does he spend time with my siblings and he rarely talks to me. (Except that now he’s being strangely friendly towards me and strangely involved with my siblings.)

I could write paragraphs about the issues with their relationship and how he picks on my mom for things she likes and how she does things, all the while trying to write it off as him trying to help her be “better,” when really all it does is make her more insecure than she already is. She always has been. And I know that’s why she drinks. 

Now my stepdad has finalized his decision to divorce her. Why? Because he feels like there’s something missing with their relationship. (Sex, I’m certain is one of them. Ugh. But that’s not my business.) it’s not that she’s a horrible housewife, as he’s so hatefully said before, but recently retracted. Or that he doesn’t “care” about her. Supposedly he does. He just isn’t in love with her anymore, he says. So he wants to divorce her. He needs to look out for “his own happiness”. That’s the painful truth that she won’t accept.

So now that the divorce has been set into motion, my stepdad has taken on the bachelor life - going out, spending money on meals and hotels and other things. He’s gone for long hours at a time. He even has taken up drawing as a hobby all of the sudden - which he has sort of picked on me for in the past. That’s besides the point but also relevant because it’s one of the things that feeds into my mom’s behavior lately with the alcohol.

So here’s where my frustration comes in. As a result of my stepdad’s behavior (going out, spending money on himself, even dipping into my mom’s allowance off of his paycheck for his own expenses). And so my mom, a person who struggles with insecurities, finds alcohol to be the easiest thing to alleviate her stress and her emotions. Except it doesn’t. She’s a horrible drunk. What ends up happening is that I end up taking responsibility for my siblings, often without notice. 

What prompted me to write this was that tonight, which is a school night, she went out and got drunk as a direct result of my stepdad going out to drink. This left me with my siblings. I also have responsibilities to attend to. I love my siblings so much, but I am not their mother. They need their mother. I have to be up at 5 am for work tomorrow morning, so I am not able to take my brothers to school and there’s no one else who can. If my mom can’t, it falls on me. Every. Time.

This year, before the divorce came about, I had plans to not only start college but also to move out on my own. I had planned to go to school from home but my stepdad has frequently pressured me to move out (especially when he’s drunk, which is when he’s more sociable it seems. I also might add that he criticized my weight because I shared food that came from his paycheck. So I’ve been buying my own food ever since)

Anyway, I had planned to move out and start school, and now my mom is getting a divorce and since she can’t stand being in the same area as my stepdad, she’s probably moving out of the state.

I have never lived on my own, mind you, and I’m still finding out how this whole “adulting” thing works. I won’t always be there to watch after my siblings when she decides to become inebriated. I wish she would ditch the alcohol. 

I’ve considered recommended AlAnon to her, but I have mentioned it briefly and she seemed to be opposed to the idea. I need her to seek help. I love her dearly and I’ve always been by her side, but as much as I hate to say it, if it weren’t for my brothers, I would probably just leave and seldom speak to her unless she made an actual effort to stop drinking. 

I am a person who hates to complain and who feels guilty for venting. But I truly feel helpless. I already suffer from issues of my own but I am slowly overcoming them without turning to alcohol. I have tried to be supportive to my mom and not judge mental, but she treats me one minute like I’m the best friend she has and another like this nagging crone who wants to spoil her fun. 

I just need help. Some words of advice, some words of encouragement. I need to scream (in paragraphs) into the void and perhaps get an answer that can let me know I’m not alone. I just want to be happy. I’m so afraid of the world and I’m trying to spread my wings and become part of it but I suffer from overprotective ness towards those I love and this situation with my mom is truly weighing on me. 

In terms of what decisions she makes, there is nothing I can technically do. But perhaps I can help somehow in a way I haven’t thought of yet. Not merely being a babysitter and a shoulder to cry on

alcoholism,Burneraccount12109,2019/02/26,"Tapering vs. Cold Turkey - in need of advice       I'm 21 and couldn't tell you the last day I went without a drink. My guess would probably be it's been close to a year but even before than I would drink most nights. I didn't think I was developing a physical addiction but the other day I tried to take 2 days off and it did not go so well.
      The first 12-24 hours weren't so bad other than troubles sleeping. When I woke up the next day I had a headache and as the day progressed I began having stomach irritation, felt faint, had trouble concentrating and was highly irritable.
      I went to detox at 19 for benzos/other pills and am really looking to avoid going back. Any help or advice is much appreciated!

alcoholism,UfcFighterNumberOne,2019/02/26,"Well i nearly died today So over the past year my alcohol use has slowly been increasing, and as a result of a very lonely and depressing Christmas I moved to spirits. A lot of spirits. I realised I had a problem and saught help and joined a support group and vowed to cut down. Yesterday I halved my intake as a starting point and stopped drinking during the day.

I was awake all night with nothing to drink and ended up shivering and shaking and utterly confused. I could barely talk to anyone. An ambulance talk me to hospital.

I've been on diazepam and drips all day.

It turns out sudden withdrawal can literally kill you. Cut down slowly. This was one of the most scary and confusing moments in my life and just wanted to warn you.

alcoholism,ShadowK2,2019/02/26,"How to start quitting So I’ve been drinking since I was about 13 years old. Currently 26. I generally drink about 8-10 drinks a night on an empty stomach.  Some weekends I have been known to roll through 2-30 racks of keystone ice.

I still feel good, I hold down a 6-digit salary job, I have three kids, and I have the house and sports car of my dreams. Nobody (not even my wife) realizes how much I drink.  I guess you can call me a functioning alcoholic. 

I just got some bloodwork back from the doctor, and it looks like my liver is pretty damaged.  I’ve just realized that I need to quit. My wife and I put about 50k into retirement funds every year to retire early. I want to live it up when I’m in my 50s and not die early from some kind of liver failure. I want to see my three kids grow up. I guess this is my wake up call. 

What is the first step? I promise myself everyday that I won’t drink tonight, but I always do.

alcoholism,Genksman,2019/02/27,Alcohol is my stupid curse My father and my grandfather were alcoholics and they eventually beat the disease.  I really wish I could do the same.  I drink when I’m really anxious and about every 3 months I get so wasted I scare my family and friends.  I have an addictive personality and I love how alcohol makes me feel in the moment.  It calls to me when I feel shitty and sometimes when I’m fine too.  I hate but I love it.  I have a surgery coming up and I would rather drink myself into a coma than face the surgery. I’ve been to therapy but it still calls me.  I just love feeling buzzed.  What can I do to break this cycle? I don’t want to be a slave to a chemical. ,0.9178260869565236,3.1391475942029,3.303797101449277,87.76221739130436,83.92753623188406,7.1582608695652175,20.79420289855072,8.238735603445708,1.1957037681159417,520,16,112,12,15,179,83,138,0.113,0.721,0.166,0.852,0,0,5,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,1,1,10,8,2,1,9,0,12,11,1,2,0,23,26,14,0,5,4,1,3,0,1,1,5,0,0,1,5,9,5,0,3,2,0,1,1,3,0,0,2,3,24,5,10,21,1,11,0,0,0,3,9,3,0,0,6,79,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16288014145814356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4790250475791886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1687920029571501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30513085507782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870442384069208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929259727329873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29273197262475503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258852869496721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14085147793245098,0.0,0.2266402084536451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11543463711606655,0.0,0.07806112754749871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14751251820605826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4045480250115464,0.0,0.09973306243616344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192585061725112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304600002954383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19143313964427872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14958656556298927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14777138794537253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11931988907542412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17086460214674254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08812653169387615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17181537926080254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10613735116593112,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Andr1997,2019/02/27,"I think I might have a problem with alcohol. So basically I am a 21 year old student and recently I was thinking and I realized that I can't remember a longer period of time (more than 2 weeks) that I did not drink in the last couple of years. I do not consider myself an alcoholic because I do not feel the need to drink alone or on a daily basis but I do feel that I might have a problem. Most of my friends drink alcohol and it is very common for me to drink excessively on weekends. For me it started to become a problem because I have lot of free time and when I drink a drink or two with my friends in my bar more often than not I continue to drink more and end up drunk and often with a medium hangover. Also for me drinking became the main thing to do on a weekend night and I can't think of last time I did something else besides drinking on a Friday or Saturday night. What I feel the main problem is that I feel I am a better person when I drink (not when I am pissed drunk but that sweet spot of tipsiness after 3-4 large beers). Also my friends told me that I am hilarious when I drink and honestly I do not have problems with drinking such as puking, being aggressive or injuring myself. I just like to drink and to laugh and make jokes. I guess my situation could be simmilar to what the comedian Bill Burr said : '' I am not an alcoholic, I just truly enjoy getting drunk.'', but I am starting to feel like I should cut down on it. The main reason is that sometimes, especially on a nice evening I cant wait to get the buzz from alcohol so I quickly drink my first two drinks. Usually this happens when I had drinking planned such as a party or an arranged meeting, but more often than not I just feel the need to quickly drink my drink in order to get that buzz. The best way I can describe it is to quench my thirst after a run. This started to get me worried because although I am relatively young and a lot of people my age are drinking even more and more often I just don't want to create a bad habit that could potentially get worse. 

I would like to ask you dear redditors if you think I do have a problem with alcohol and it would help me a lot if you have been in a simmilar situation or have any advice. I hope this was more or less comprehensible and kind regards.",6.4310371959942785,5.336787579399143,7.251598712446357,77.65540951359084,65.9098712446352,10.341773962804007,34.43812589413448,9.516144504307137,2.969106151645208,1796,70,370,30,24,603,193,466,0.105,0.711,0.184,0.9934,0,1,27,0,0,0,28.0,0,3,0,4,23,28,3,0,31,0,45,33,2,2,0,85,74,39,0,17,25,0,6,3,3,5,7,1,0,1,20,19,31,1,13,27,2,1,12,10,0,3,8,8,60,19,51,57,16,50,0,0,0,0,12,12,1,21,38,285,80,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042387565548295134,0.0,0.2781413418160729,0.0,0.0449255571387406,0.0,0.06937724585714428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029497891424646133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04055169997405551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036218037121203486,0.07932676799708893,0.047906559942579134,0.0,0.0,0.04552155319752079,0.038363488682789854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06926611299763949,0.047995896989811375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8073671811766029,0.0,0.0,0.03623597149136448,0.0,0.03841920428463267,0.0,0.0,0.05730028420442325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315964833307602,0.030988583652811593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03689650903175413,0.0,0.0,0.10053903764042686,0.0,0.11331362978544272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04778472708502899,0.0,0.038358195014673004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02907473208533707,0.0,0.0,0.04308321264135887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04517053778999496,0.0,0.07071619429821904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06357552818286108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063288755970098,0.0,0.0,0.028954527482025805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203242154504976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643270876177552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08141287346138233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04551693254207165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030072194946231864,0.037875179720638634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24903595601467615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04459884689969003,0.04282961829339518,0.0,0.0491377583945852,0.0,0.041261521729611776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975152761877985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03339378357889028,0.042901026087111695,0.0,0.09210752885851044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028817794313990844,0.11117708615340156,0.0,0.0,0.0758805456788615,0.0,0.0,0.04144864415594708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08474617845727281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04777370844598497,0.03579062114961785,0.02558491659131804,0.03443069488267568,0.03479446479769257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04405151472447926,0.04420493468423604,0.06162764435656281,0.0,0.0,0.055866814922809815
alcoholism,janko79,2019/02/27,"Tonight I'll be a week sober My brother and I got drunk, he drank 20 plus beers and hung himself in my garage after a night of us drinking. He said he was going out to work on his girls a play house. I was the one who found him the next morning. This was January 31. I was shocked when I found him, my eyes watered but I couldn't cry. I called my dad and told him to call 911 I knew he was dead he was frozen his hands were purple and his tongue was sticking out. I just sat there till my dad showed up. I will never forget seeing my dad's reaction to seeing him. After the ambulance showed up and they took my brother im ashamed to admit I went to my sister's and the first thing I did was drink. Yep. I drink the day I found my brother dead. This time and the next few weeks I noticed now when I drink I didn't have fun I hated myself for it, for depressed about my brother and took my anger out on others. It's only been a week of sobriety but I have no urge to ever drink again. I don't like the person I am when I'm drunk and drinking led to my brother killing himself.

alcoholism,lewdak,2019/02/27,"Sober people, sober people everywhere. Okay, maybe not ""everywhere,"" but quite a few places.

I used to think about the fact that it seems like everyone drinks. Every professional meeting would end with a happy hour. Every personal get together was, ""hey, bring the (insert booze here)"" or a question of what bar we're going to.

It just struck me that I'm not necessarily surrounded by sober people, but I've bumped into enough of them to know I'm not the only one. They are out there. It's nice to know I'm not alone and to see examples of people leading enjoyable, productive lives.

My new business partner is in longtime recovery for alcoholism, a few newer friends related to my hobbies are in recovery, and I've met a few other professionals who are sober. Worth mentioning because my business has a lot of drinkers in it.

I thought I'd post this to essentially say, you are not alone. You can do this. Lots of people ARE doing it.

alcoholism,mentalmerism,2019/02/27,"How to support an alcoholic that is exiting an abusive relationship and needs a life line out (in this case a plane ticket) while not saving them from the consequences of their actions? As I write this my friend is sitting on a curb on an island with no place to stay, 48 cents, a suitcase, and a cat. She’s made a lot of poor decisions the most recent being following her abusive significant other to an island. Her family is tired of saving her from her poor decisions. She desperately needs a plane ticket home, but I don’t have the money for that. Shelters are full or not answering phones. She has no transportation. Her mom doesn’t want to save her this time bc she never learns. However, I do think providing a life line to someone leaving an abuser is different than saving someone from the consequences of their addiction. What can I do to help? I nearly escaped an abusive relationship so I know what it’s like but I haven’t the slightest idea how to get someone out. I’m afraid she’ll run straight back since she has no options currently. Any suggestions welcome.

It not good for me but who cares. Why suffer with the pain when I’d rather be numb. I work and pay bills but when I’m alone I can’t stand the pain, it’s just too much. Alcohol make it better. 

I know this isnt good for me and there must be a better way but drowning it out is easier.

alcoholism,Th31R1ng13,2019/02/28,"Is it worth loving an alcoholic? Sorry, maybe this isn’t the best place to ask... but I guess I would like to hear it from people who have had their own issues with alcohol.

I love my ex, we were together for 3 years and it wasn’t until this last year that his drinking hit a breaking point for me. I ignored and sadly just didn’t realize some of the signs that maybe alcohol was becoming more than just a way to have fun. His family is full of alcoholics that would rather see him suffer and go down the same path as them, than take a second to look at themselves and him to maybe think about getting help. I hate my situation, I love this man with all my heart and just want him to change for his health and own happiness. 

But in the long run, is this a battle worth fighting for?
Again, maybe this isn’t the right place for something like this... So I’m sorry if it isn’t!",5.4916759776536335,4.981684452513966,5.696027932960894,86.10672346368717,67.60335195530726,9.394636871508382,26.83854748603352,8.841846274778883,1.5814554189944126,683,16,152,10,10,217,108,179,0.127,0.674,0.199,0.9454,0,0,6,0,2,0,20.0,1,0,2,1,7,14,3,0,10,0,15,10,1,0,1,27,31,12,0,5,7,1,0,2,0,2,5,1,0,1,14,9,5,1,2,1,2,2,5,6,0,1,5,3,19,8,24,23,8,18,0,2,2,3,19,8,0,3,8,106,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4782682749244788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045938989070078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12356408956523247,0.0,0.0,0.11741250641225093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11835556493518455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10960106595939816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10547171861641601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05845335384779143,0.0,0.06358471275025035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12324984938308715,0.0,0.0,0.1190997086428084,0.0,0.11045960639539584,0.0,0.11892457448602176,0.12609833983514449,0.13257986178671186,0.07499166719096123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167749941993026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09119818012868047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10931908932666433,0.0,0.0,0.09901141680583134,0.09395210164360396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3029316844038184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4495991558665733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0775643960704576,0.0,0.2337842608747654,0.0,0.10576397785079407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09554600635081012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891548990779209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575925233715307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08613167946122086,0.0,0.2504838781107881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412080275979157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716890100621202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599048082345832,0.08880615663857845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15895451011502246,0.0,0.0,0.14409575914280726
alcoholism,Guilty_Kitchen,2019/02/28,"48 hours This is a throwaway because well yeah, but long story short I got caught drinking at work, and sent home. I generally drink at least a pint of liquor a night, usually rumpleminze, and on the weekends significantly more. Which isn't good, I'm a 32 year old female who is 4'8"" and weighs a little over a 100lbs now.  I don't know if I still have a job or not, I called into my other job yesterday because I was so severely hungover. There is plenty of alcohol in my house right now, which I know if I can stomach enough I will feel normal again, but right now it doesn't sound appealing at all.  I really wish this process could go faster, I really don't want to go to AA because I just have found most of those places to be more religious that I care for. Either way, I know I have to do this, I'm ruining my life.  I haven't told my boyfriend yet because I don't want to put that kind of pressure on the situation yet, but I know that I have to, I know that he knows he just hasn't said anything to me yet because I don't think that he wants to face this situation either. But thanks for listening.

alcoholism,abadluckwind,2019/02/28,"Nobody seems to realize how toxic a person I really am. I don't know what to do. I have a severe drinking problem. Every time things go good in my life I just feel compelled to fuck it up. Usually ill just go on these long benders where I'm arguing with everyone I know just to push people out of my life. It hardly ever works. I think people like me because I have a sense of humor and I make fun of myself a lot. I use to think its funny that people say oh your just like Bojack or you remind me of Bad Santa. These are not people to envy basically they fuck up everyone around them and then try to make it up with one super nice gesture in hopes of redemption. I want to be a better person. I just ghosted a really nice girl because I just thought I'd ruin her and move on but she didn't deserve that. Every problem I've ever had is because I've made it myself. I really want help but A.A.,rehab, interventions or jail don't work on me. I feel like I might just be a lost cause at this point. I can go months even years without drinking but the moment things are good bam fuck it up.

alcoholism,CorporateMisfit,2019/03/01,"Am I an Alcoholic? Need an honest opinion here guys. Sorry for the long post to those that don't have the time. I'm a 32 year old male with a corporate career - I make decent money, am good at my job, am never late, never drunk during work, but I love to drink. As for the reason - the job is stressful (as is everyones), and I only find solace and true inner peace through drinking. I had my first full beer (dad gave me sips before that) at 15 years old, where I chugged my friend's dad's corona and chased it with a soda.  My first time getting drunk was 16 when I could drive to my friend's house to spend the night and get drunk off of whiskey my friend had slowwwlyyy accumulated from his dad's weekly whiskey purchases. I drank during weekends in high school to be more brave around the girls and at parties, but as with many people, my drinking picked up significantly in college where I was drunk at least once a weekend my freshman year,  drunk at least twice a weekend my sophomore year, drunk at least 3 times a week during my junior year, and back down to twice a week my senior year so I could actually graduate. I was given three underage drinking citations in college, but they were almost a badge of honor at the college I attended. Pick up cigarette butts on Saturday to dismiss the ticket, get laughed at, then party it up all over again. 

When I got out of college, my first job was as a Project Manager that I somehow lucked in to with 0 experience (my cousin hooked me up as he was a Director in a different dept). I never should have been in this role right out of college as I had no real work experience outside of cashiering and bartending before that. Right after graduation I stopped drinking for about 3 months ""to stop being a kid and focus on my career."" Soon after the first 3 months, all the stress and gossip and drama at work built up to the point my nightly gym/exercising could not overcome it. My anxiety was building up from the older employees who I knew where thinking ""what the fck is this little kid doing in this role? I'm twice his age!"" My girlfriend of 6 years then broke up with me when I brought up marriage, so I started drinking pretty much nightly. Started with 2 beers a night, then 3 beers, then 4, then 6, then 8. It worked though. My stress would disappear for the night, then the slight hangover in the morning would help me start the next day on an even keel. I actually felt the hangovers and coffee worked for me. Working out/exercising never could do that for me, no matter how much I exercised.

2 years later I finally admitted to myself I had gained 30 pounds and might have a problem, so began my first test at quitting. I told myself ""if you can quit for a month, you're not an alcoholic."" And I succeeded without a hitch. I lost a ton of weight, never had a crazy urging to drink, and felt completely in control. Back to 2 beers a night, then slowly back to 4, then switched to whiskey and vodka to not gain all the weight back. 2 shots, 4 shots, 6 shots, half a fifth a night. ""Ok wow time to look at what you're beginning to drink. If you can quit for 3 months, you're not an alcoholic."" So I succeeded again, without a hitch. No problems. Then I drank again - this time with whiskey only. 2 drinks a night, then 5, then 8, then half a  fifth a night. Still no crazy hangovers, still no work related issues. This went on for years, but to this day, I still think it helps my life in general, which I realize is crazy. 

6 Months ago, I went to my doctor for my annual physical. He asked his usual ""how much do you drink"" and this time I was deadly honest. ""I drink nightly. I sometimes drink 3/4 of a fifth a night, can wake up in the morning at 6am, go to work, and feel that my day went very well. I feel that it helps me with the social anxiety I've had my whole life, it helps me stay even keeled at my job, it gives me a sweet release and peace that nothing else can. I can quit anytime I want, and however long I want. But I don't really care to."" He didn't say I was an alcoholic, but said I was a heavy/problem drinker and he wanted me to try Zoloft. I've been on it 6 months now, and my drinking actually INCREASED. I now drink just about a fifth a night, and I think the Zoloft has actually just made me more lazy and I no longer care at all about how much I'm drinking. I have an appointment next week to tell him I need to come off of it. I know if I told myself to quit tomorrow for another 3 months, I could do it - and I will. 

My job is still not affected. But - I'm to the point where I need another opinion because here I am yet again at the point of telling myself I need another break. Am I an alcoholic? I never drink while driving, I'm always responsible, it doesn't affect my work, I can quit however long I want, I can ""turn off"" the effects when my mother calls, I'm a good son, brother, etc. I know I drink a LOT compared to others, but I honestly feel it's just who I am. My dad drinks maybe 7 beers a week, but his dad drank a lot nightly like me, but also lived to 87 and was a successful lawyer.

alcoholism,RealityWin,2019/03/01,"Dating Someone in Recovery-Advice Hi All, I have a question for the group. I have been dating someone in recovery for 14 years, she got sober when she was 21. My question is this- she is working step 9 right now, as her sponsor is having her work the steps again. My question is this: Is it normal to work the steps again after being sober for so long, and what would make a sponsor ask her to do them again? She's making amends to people from college, and I would have thought that she would have done that by now. Also facing challenges in that she states that she has never had a relationship for more than 90 days- ever. Difficult to get to know, like there's something in there. Probably not a healthy relationship but asking for some advice. Thanks.",3.1407783251231507,5.5512589448275875,3.50445812807882,88.38456896551727,76.79310344827587,5.798029556650246,23.46059113300493,6.868970318607317,0.8085763546798033,597,19,113,6,14,185,89,145,0.024,0.927,0.049,0.5221,0,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,1,4,11,4,0,0,7,0,20,1,1,2,3,19,29,7,0,4,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,0,5,0,0,3,2,1,0,0,6,0,16,3,19,19,3,23,0,0,0,0,20,5,0,4,15,89,24,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2798949474339661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11452851992746588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26777230033803506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236145306293952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14655807463871098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295456420650901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07482362348979968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11454165455565847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07870689984819673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996733156941999,0.0,0.0,0.12674025499994582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.191193474848732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1104557895885132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403197242938574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992868464468596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.154409367235423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4812987796599697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30751738114669663,0.0,0.12230433216480265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24269022662555706,0.1102534573350919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13185259646656736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11369625226949436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31278541029399626,0.0,0.0,0.30520624482442865,0.0,0.0,0.09222539100710336

alcoholism,Pootie_Poot655,2019/03/01,"17 and becoming an alcoholic. Need advice Hi all

As the title says, I'm currently 17, and I think I'm developing an addiction to alcohol. I've been depressed for a few years but never really done much about it until it hit hard towards the end of last year. I started drinking my parent'a alcohol because it helped me push away the unbearable sadness that sometimes came over me.

 I saw a GP, got prescribed Fluoxetine (prozac), and continued drinking for a while until around a month or so ago when my mood appeared to be heading upwards. Things were great for a week or two until it came back. For 5 or 6 nights in a row I drank dangerous amounts of alcohol purely because I couldn't handle being sober. 

The last time was last week when I consumed around a pint of 40% over the course of a few hours, and stayed up the entire night throwing up almost constantly. The next day I came clean to my parent's, who were understandable pissed off, but didn't really help much other than recommending I talk to the GP about it. Not that I blame them, it was my fault.

I swore not to drink again at least until I was 18, but tonight I've had a couple of swigs of relatively strong raki, gin etc. and plan to have more later on when it wears off. I'm not particularly drunk at the moment as I stopped myself before having to much, but the fact I couldn't say no to it scares me.

At 17 I'm worried this will become a problem, and I don't know what to do about it. Can anyone give any advice at all about what I should do to get off this path before it's too late?

This is my first time on this sub, and though I've read rule 2, I know that I won't have the confidence to post this if I'm not at least slightly drunk. Hell, I'll almost certainly delete this at tomorrow anyway.

alcoholism,Josh1535,2019/03/01,"Hoping for a boost First of all I want to thank all of you who post and comment here because I’ve been silently reading for a while now and it has helped me more than about anything. I am 25 and male who’s never considered myself to have any mental issues outside of the normal. I’ve been binge drinking almost every weekend since around 18 or so. For some reason roughly a year and a half ago I starting drinking almost every day to the extent of 3-4 fifths of whiskey a week. About 10 months ago I started having some anxiety which I had never dealt with in the past.  Around 7 months ago I had a full on panic attack after a long hard night of binging. And then another a few months later after the same binging and then another recently. After that first attack it seems my mind has been literally dominated by anxiety, fear, dread, doom, and intrusive persistent negative thoughts. I’ve been tapering my alcohol for a couple weeks now to only drinking on weekends with hopes of being sober all together and actually having some control of my drinking. I know it’s most likely the drinking causing my anxiety etc. but it’s tough to tell myself that when it’s really heavy. Can anyone relate? I need some reassurance that it’s in fact the alcohol to ease my mind at times. Any idea on when and if I will get control back of my own mind?",5.999353448275862,6.4454963371647525,6.7312619731800805,75.8571228448276,66.47126436781609,9.436877394636015,32.0213122605364,9.354420925462401,2.892986398467433,1068,41,192,19,16,353,149,261,0.087,0.853,0.06,-0.4329,0,0,8,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,5,11,12,2,3,15,0,15,8,0,4,6,46,26,18,0,6,3,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,1,12,13,8,2,5,9,0,0,3,7,0,3,7,2,19,5,36,17,15,45,1,1,0,0,8,9,0,12,36,139,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.08725815615377815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23778849705576915,0.1911192964622046,0.17907654718178584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12161333988080487,0.18752317659373366,0.20521142824702734,0.0,0.0,0.062522490382759,0.0,0.07358262506054061,0.15920028942455822,0.0,0.20344963853061795,0.0,0.06875620303201044,0.0,0.05450781243533954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09185595606171232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005776817157726,0.0,0.09893828086690187,0.0,0.057666609160261034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4379734077276082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09972366298635382,0.0,0.0,0.15067546633531825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061905671912907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15211621836619904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04671672552401787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801001262780283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05993437334444756,0.0,0.0,0.17762264111301376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094098167008632,0.0,0.09332818380760408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04914128006051228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04368466096836573,0.0,0.0,0.07913128808154643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901113696588086,0.0,0.270857234896743,0.0,0.21411554281773065,0.0,0.0,0.06630162015126329,0.13792790469305988,0.0,0.0,0.08391185753246448,0.08760973793705201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06800570665899412,0.0,0.1049116589294815,0.0,0.0,0.08535870559043544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08563683040411961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944126179015477,0.0,0.057282861021454176,0.09193563445304888,0.0882885636043779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08140193703466543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07396671956852778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12657971662444514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07815445538221806,0.08232321921160955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07098716104156001,0.05213980924454629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05274050121837362,0.0,0.1434499507946863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05758165773155086
alcoholism,yyyvfhh,2019/03/02,"Is it realistic to hope to just drink socially again? I have just started seeing a counsellor for alcohol addiction who has made me do a drinks diary for the last two weeks. From this I can see that at an absolute minimum I drink 4 pints of beer a day but usually in the 8-10 range. I am a university student and most of my social life revolves around drinking. Is it realistic to expect to be able just to drink in social situations again and not everyday/ by myself when I’m feeling shit. (Also massively struggle with depression/ self harm etc, which I am now also seeing a counsellor/ therapist for.)

alcoholism,kb1842,2019/03/02,"I can't stop at one drink I'm a wife and a mother of a 3 yr old. I went through postpartum depression and drank a lot. I got better. However, I'm drinking a lot more. I can't seem to go a day without having a drink. It's true, I went Sunday-Wednesday last week and felt like I was going to lose it. When I'm out with friends or with my husband and child I can't just have one drink. Drinking helps me get rid of all my anxiety and stress. Even though I run, watch my favorite shows, hang out with my family and friends, a drink cures everything. My marriage is now suffering and I feel like a awful parent. I keep telling myself, ok, don't drink for a month. But I know I won't be able to make it. Any help/advice you can give me would be much appreciated.

alcoholism,xKravenMooreheadx,2019/03/02,"Advice about my wife My wife and I had always been social drinkers. We would drink on occasion, but nothing too serious. Fast forward a few years and now we have a child and she had a gastric sleeve surgery. I was against the surgery, but she insisted that she needed it. Well now there has been a transference of addiction from food to wine at first and now vodka. 

Last year she went on vacation with our child and got into a wreck (backed into a pole). She was shitfaced drunk and didn't even remember doing it, with our child in the car not in his car seat (6yo at that time). 

After that, she drank at least a box of wine a week, blaming it on how stressful her job is. Until we had an incident on NYE where I fucked up and pushed her down. That caused her to stop drinking for a couple of weeks. 

Now she's drinking heavily again and I'm pretty sure lying to me. I think she drunk 80% of a fifth the other night, and I'm almost positive she drove home drunk last night with our child and the neighbor and their child all in the car. Im asking our child when he gets up. She says the neighbor drove. 

Idk what to do. I am a pothead. I smoke daily and she always likes to throw that in my face whenever we talk about her alcoholism. 

I needed to get that off my chest. Any advice would be appreciated.

alcoholism,iamwomanhearmepour,2019/03/02,"Starting a new life tomorrow, and I’m terrified I’m 28/f and my dad, who is almost 6yrs sober came to me last evening begging me to go to meetings with for at least a week, and knowing I need the help, I asked him if we could go together for as long as it takes. I’m very scared and nervous. I’d just like some advice for some of the beginning steps. This just seems surreal and I am (somewhat) aware of the mental and physical challenges that will come along with it. I’m considering moving back home with them so they can help me along the way. I’ve been selfish because of alcohol and messed up relationships with friends, jobs, and family over the past few years. I’m really needing some insight on what helps cope with the first few steps to a brighter life.",3.507941176470588,5.052155431372547,4.190343137254903,87.72904411764708,73.11764705882355,7.975816993464052,27.782679738562088,8.59863814320734,1.883401307189542,603,23,127,11,12,192,102,153,0.094,0.7959999999999999,0.11,0.1137,1,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,1,0,2,2,5,7,0,2,9,0,6,3,0,0,0,32,23,12,0,4,3,1,0,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,6,18,1,0,3,0,0,7,0,4,0,1,2,0,11,3,23,19,7,23,0,0,0,0,13,4,0,7,12,77,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661322852601104,0.0,0.18168951257088745,0.17024094988111535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589368603911995,0.0,0.0,0.13072757430939372,0.0,0.10363681800849132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19444671165928348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14644898519299174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13573954406831604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11229032662996996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1602707614127772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14461083773687394,0.0,0.0,0.13134968447311687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19324176111622052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34186334757718445,0.0,0.1705343853922147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16870918036756974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09343332030389324,0.13858124206585445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2401668767664239,0.0830585388821422,0.0,0.0,0.15045393559708795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17133058915002594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18069424769300169,0.0,0.25212125140541025,0.0,0.16419719268000768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16229425180492005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891307461161677,0.0,0.0,0.1825276438730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17021016116991075,0.0,0.0,0.1547711668672792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033430135300115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127826731998159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14027646092791488,0.0,0.1349464152980252,0.1363721618939644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109481182904397
alcoholism,puravida_2018,2019/03/03,Its not just cirrhosis. I felt like the biggest risk of being an alcoholic would be cirrhosis but it's not.  There are so many diseases and conditions caused by alcohol. I am currently watching rain in my heart an amazing documentary on youtube about alcohlosm.  It just ravages the body and the brain.  You could also die by negligence due to being drunk and being stupid and driving or putting yourself into dangerous situations.  Why is this horrible liquid poison so socially acceptable? ,6.136428571428571,9.240653833333337,6.345476190476191,68.27035714285716,70.19047619047619,10.390476190476187,37.88095238095238,10.411451182825502,5.246552380952382,398,23,56,13,8,127,69,84,0.264,0.643,0.093,-0.9677,1,0,2,0,0,0,7.0,0,1,0,0,7,7,3,1,5,0,9,7,3,1,0,16,10,9,1,2,6,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,4,5,3,0,2,1,0,2,2,4,0,0,1,2,4,3,8,3,0,8,0,0,1,0,2,4,0,1,3,44,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4944992802057043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18501563583650008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569848136437996,0.0,0.2582702654101444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.237666761001845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18471926609149836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2401114249673224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22213843314444756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27415845733716365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11302905465204588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345590848190036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23257709104037005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26005429596913804,0.0,0.2358387224872712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20876317297140606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643489542553095,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,anontrouble1124,2019/03/03,"Second round of treatment after a week long binge I'm not even sure where to start because, as we all know, loving an alcoholic is a twisted path. My SO finished inpatient rehab 5 months ago. Since then, he hasn't had longer than a 12 day stretch of sobriety. He drank hours after he left rehab. After this past week, I can safely say he's in the darkest place he's ever been. He started naltrexone a couple months ago but doesn't take it or hides it when he knows he wants to drink. He started drinking at work. He's been bouncing back and forth between our house and his parents' house because I can't stop letting him back. He says he's really ready for treatment this time, but who knows if that's true. 

I've asked him to come up with a plan for himself. He has been calling inpatient rehab, IOPs, and psychiatrists. He asked me what I think he should do, but I really don't know the answer. His mom is basically trying to force him into rehab. She's a mess, understandably. I'm just having a hard time trying to balance him, his parents, and my own needs. I personally see inpatient as 30 days of guaranteed sobriety-and then what? Is it stupid to tell him that I think an IOP might be a good option this time around? He needs help, but it seems like everyone disagrees on what's best. Ultimately it is up to him, and I can only hope that if he really, truly wants to get sober it won't really matter what he chooses.

alcoholism,sellardoore,2019/03/03,"21st birthday beginning of February. I’m going to stop drinking. I’ve been drinking since I was probably 14. The other day i called an ex so many times he was forced to block me. I still have strong feelings for him so it sucks that I ruined that for good. I don’t even remember all of it, but I know it’s not something sober me would’ve ever wanted. At present, I’m finding it very difficult to forgive myself for this. I think the only way i can forgive myself is if i learn my lesson about drinking for good, and choose to take care of my body and mind. There’s no excuses. Alcohol brings out the worst in me. So it can’t stay anymore. 

I work in a club so it’ll be a little more challenging to stay sober but I’m determined. I can’t imagine how ill live with myself if I ruin any other relationships, or lose my job. I’m planning on going back to school, so I need to have my shit completely together before then. I downloaded a sobriety countdown app on my phone. I know where the AA meetings are in my city, although i do believe i can hold myself accountable. I’ve just never tried before. We’ll see how it works out for now. 

Time to turn a new leaf. I don’t want to turn out like my dad. Wish me luck.

alcoholism,meliodelt,2019/03/03,"Here We Go Again - Alcohol Withdrawal - My blog So it should be stated that this post has been deleted on another Subreddit for attempting to circumvent conventional wisdom on alcohol detox methodology. This is in no way an advocacy of an action plan for a safe or successful alcohol detox plan. The professional world largely frowns on the tapering concept. This is merely a means for me to keep track of, and share, my plan and progress with alcohol use. So...

# Alcohol detox and withdrawals can be very dangerous and fatal. Professional help and the care of a physician is recommended.

**Post Two:**

Note: I decided to turn this into a running blog of sorts to track my progress and create accountability. I will provide updates below with some details. At the time I wrote this, I had been up for about two hours after not getting much sleep--though that has been the case for weeks, most nights little to no sleep.

Note 2: I realize now that most of what I've experienced lately would be mild withdrawal (like an overnight situation), but significantly more so a compounded/perpetual hangover that has gone on for a very long time.

**Original Post:**

Not super easy to compose in my current state, but:

As an alcoholic, I've come to realize that the greatest struggles are: ""I'm going to drink, but when and how much is too much"" and ""Am I experiencing hangover or withdrawal and all the complications associated with the two."" I found myself stuck in my old ways after a three month stint of sobriety. It probably took 2-4 months to get back where I was, but I'm in the pickle once again--and have been for close to eight months. After experiencing long periods of 5-8 drink daily averages of drinks on weekdays and with averages more in the 6-12 drink daily range on weekends, I found myself stuck in a long loop of 8-15+ drink range over the course of about four weeks. Now I am attempting to regain control and I find myself playing an old game of ""Am I drinking because my body and mind are used to it being present"" or ""Am I drinking to alleviate and, inevitably, perpetuate a hangover."" It is a really nasty combination to overcome; especially while maintaining control of daily life, family and a job. Of which, I have pretty much lost all. What little hope I have left hangs in the balance of the immediate action in which I take in the following few days. I have finally realized, not for the first time unfortunately, that I'm ultimately experiencing the perpetual hangover. Yes, withdrawal is cause for concern; but the fact that significant symptoms really should not arise for 6-12+ hours, it only makes sense to feel as miserable as possible for at least 6 hours and then go back to the ""have a drink to prolong withdrawal symptom"" concept. I know that it is in my best interest (and a fantastical final goal) to cease drinking all together. The last time I was sober, I successfully tapered in just five days. The difference last time, is that I finally came clean about my problem and had the ""support"" of those around me. I'm now trying to keep it a secret again and solve the problem completely by myself. So, I originally planned to follow a taper schedule of two less drinks each day starting with 8 or 10 with a goal of reaching 4 and going from there. I would prefer to do a long taper from there so I don’t experience the Post-Acute-Withdrawal symptoms that I did last time--look them up, I never felt right. So, at this point in the day recently where I have had 4 or 5 drinks I have had two. My goal for the day started at 8, but I think I can do 6. The difficulty comes in the form of interacting with others and accomplishing things. Without it in my system from time to time, I don't feel capable or normal. Did I mention I was an alcoholic?

I just also thought to mention that beside the hangover/withdrawal conundrum comes the insomnia and total lack of appetite twist that is present; not fun.

I'm not really looking for the suggestion of going the ""professional"" or medical route. Just sharing my story for my sake and others.

**And, Updates:**

Strategies I have attempted to employ during this hangover/""withdrawal"" nightmare and will continue to use for now:

* When you are hungry, eat. Appetite is hard to come by. Just take in what you can when you can't eat something substantial.
* Don't eat a big meal too late; supposedly eating too close to the time you sleep can create poor sleep. A snack before bed may curb late night hunger. I've read a good suggestion is a handful of nuts.
* Don't have any drinks 2-3 hours prior to the time you plan on sleeping; this can interrupt your sleep prematurely.
* Try not to stack drinks on top of each other. I.e. if you had a drink less than two hours ago.

Day 1: Started tracking times and drinks in a journal. 10 drinks consumed. Due also to the lack of sleep in the week prior, this was not a productive day. Managed to go grocery shopping out of necessity.

Day 2: Original Post. Pulled off the six hours of no drinks following the first two. Mild to moderate back pain present.

That changed last year and I decided to go cold turkey last week. The boredom/restlessness and loss of pleasure in simple stuff is driving me nuts.

alcoholism,jessdoesntlikecoffee,2019/03/03,"Finally going to stop. Hey guys. I’ve been drinking every day (literally every day) for almost a year. I’m young and I don’t want this habit to stick. It’s expensive and I can feel it taking a toll on my health. I’ve decided to stop drinking for a month, I’ll probably go longer than that in all honesty because I know it’ll feel great the longer I stop.  Tomorrow I have a family event and my whole family is going to be drinking and I know it’ll be hard to be around it since I just made this choice. Any tips to stay sober during these types of events or even just in general? I’m notorious for telling myself I deserve a drink or “one won’t kill me”. I really want to uphold this decision I’ve made. this is an itch I refuse to scratch now.

alcoholism,BETHANY-82,2019/03/04,"What do you think is the root of your drinking? I hear a lot of people say that the cause of a problem drinking must be some sort of difficulty with life, wanting to numb the pain, escaping a strain with a marriage or job etc etc.   


I wonder if all problem drinkers have this? Or can it also arise from someone who just loves a good time and never wants the party to end?  Or does it perhaps start out that way and then morph into not wanting to face issues in their life that are  a result of heavy drinking, which perpetuates more drinking?   


I suppose there are a million permutations but I just wonder if alcoholism is always about unaddressed mental health.

alcoholism,CheesecakeDeHam,2019/03/04,"Withdrawal confusion? Hi everyone, I'm a university student who's essentially had far too much alcohol for far too long. During the days I'd feel lethargic, tired and just not even able to be myself, concentrate and just generally function. I decided a couple days ago that I'm going to not drink for a while. My question is, is how I felt previously normal, and is it normal to continue feeling just completely dead for a while after my quitting?
Also, if I were to have a heavy night out when I decide drink again (I'll be drinking only on nights out this time around), will I have to go through feeling shitty and fatigued and just awful again? Or will it just be a normal hangover and go after a day?
Thanks :)",6.5225729927007325,6.67757354744526,7.3675821167883235,72.74217609489052,65.35036496350365,10.353649635036495,33.91332116788321,10.125756701596842,3.4499058394160587,564,23,101,12,8,189,86,137,0.155,0.774,0.071,-0.9307,0,0,4,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,1,14,3,0,1,8,1,12,6,0,1,0,31,22,13,1,4,9,0,4,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,5,9,4,0,7,3,0,3,2,2,0,0,3,4,8,1,15,14,1,25,0,1,0,0,3,6,0,4,16,74,13,1,0.14824650874403025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13141158531908348,0.15843043320515954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185526794826126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13197082286721076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15543364391025638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640319422316086,0.0,0.2868202020366748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43567542160148376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09791542087930932,0.0,0.0,0.14165589206948445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22487366739053147,0.0,0.14233989655131646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527557217841012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13119349519289314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897824138877793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27823861192471505,0.4357503085650761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11274815014336476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16607001760067622,0.1576784100727299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364854677049094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0864437314154873,0.17038755385884502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Em101597,2019/03/04,My mother is a severe alcoholic and im afraid she'll never get the help she needs My mom has been a drinker for about 10 years now. But 5 years ago her and my dad split and ever since then she has been a severe alcoholic. The past 5 years she has drank almost every single day. She drink anywhere between 6 24oz cans a day all the way up to 10-11. She's been doing this for years. Up until a month ago she was unemployed all those years as well. So she sat at home all day everyday drinking her life away. She has totalled my grandmothers car back in 2017 from a DUI. She hit a pole head on. After that I thought that would be her wake up call. But nope. As soon as she got released from the hospital she was right back to drinking. Just the past week or so she had to go to the ER for alcohol withdrawal and the doctor told her she has to stop drinking. Of course she didn't listen and is back to her ways. She comes home from work everyday and gets drunk. She has already said multiple times that she does not want to do rehab or anything to help her kick her habit. I'm worried that my mother is gonna run out of time before she ever gets the help she desperately needs. It makes me feel so hopeless watching her drink herself to death on a daily basis. ,2.019200399800102,3.7821300804597726,3.1222422122272206,92.88937031484258,77.69731800766283,6.224954189571881,21.309511910711308,7.079830092131019,0.3986400466433455,985,26,218,11,23,316,148,261,0.117,0.871,0.012,-0.9755,2,0,9,0,0,1,19.0,0,0,0,1,13,3,0,1,16,0,22,15,2,1,7,30,42,18,1,4,6,4,1,0,0,3,6,2,2,0,7,8,10,1,2,6,0,4,4,2,2,0,13,4,36,1,33,24,5,46,0,1,1,0,40,10,0,3,30,144,43,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16926980287964374,0.3061087209357277,0.09560676467894567,0.0,0.10536161926150307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856971590457087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08970410417285216,0.2202485437747319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124418439236343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09749303949545113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08224527456287375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847249576312552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977251035610183,0.08355286394343896,0.0,0.0,0.4676572246587114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17272944103986945,0.08044377714178078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04827621204983943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496489089398735,0.0,0.054261972792343335,0.0,0.07636195109226404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09798729640391007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19198934596519274,0.0,0.19154311421838133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313191156286647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06743846908372995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06373186607176365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118219070652145,0.0762091021537618,0.0,0.0,0.14159047614872505,0.07363801086282436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1822878496847458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815371269724626,0.09082081475586898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21572443608327735,0.0,0.0789798425662417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07982333171793421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07579834330887915,0.11134720992332103,0.0,0.0,0.09123269028799873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0563150090661069,0.15157093731767005,0.07658616331769917,0.0,0.08584559533477679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950864089837189,0.09696187369735693,0.0,0.06782436320000244,0.0,0.0,0.3074213841623544
alcoholism,DrakeLively,2019/03/05,"Is my fiancé showing early signs of a problem with alcohol, or am I just overreacting? My fiancé and I have a very happy relationship. We have a great group of friends and are very social.  During the week , after work she will have a couple glasses of wine , or a few cocktails (not everyday but maybe 3 out of 5 days) When we go out with friends for occasions/ celebrations holidays, she does tend to “over do” it and sometimes drinks to the point where she is pretty sloppy drunk and needs to suddenly leave or will fight with me for no reason. This is also not every time.. maybe 40% of the time. 

We are starting to fight about it a bit, she says I am overreacting, maybe I am? I just tell her we can still have fun but she always just takes it a little too far. Is this Normal or a does this look like the beginning of an issue with alcohol? Thanks.

alcoholism,joesober2k,2019/03/05,"Anxiety w/incidental alcohol contact Hi, I've been sober 7 months.  One thing I have noticed is any incidental contact with alcohol such as having my arm wiped for a blood draw, or eating a meal cooked with wine will set off my anxiety.  I will have increased HR/BP/butterflies for 48-72hrs.

This isn't debilitating, but it is annoying.  Will this post withdrawal symptom ever go away?

alcoholism,justafewnightcaps,2019/03/05,"""Your face looks different"" I'm a long time lurker and decided to make a throwaway account so I could feel comfortable actively participating here. I'm two days in. Well, as of tonight I'll be a full two days in. 

Yesterday, I took my daughter to her final allergy testing appointment and got great news. We've been trying to figure out what has made her sick for the past 6 months. Today, my coworker told me ""I think the allergy testing was stressing you out more than you realize. Your face looks different. You look happy.""

Today was the first day in many months that I haven't come to work hungover in some fashion. One day and my face changed. I'm sure the good news helped but that's not the main reason I look different. Hopefully I can keep this up and I'll keep improving.

alcoholism,deviltresslilith,2019/03/05,"Trying to get through my first day... Not really an alcoholic just trying to quit my casual drinking habits during the week. Its extremely hard really, i havent been drinking heavy-ish that long maybe 2-3 months. I started lightly but i am now up to 7 beers a day,more consumption on the weekends but that doesnt matter. My family and friends are worried about me and think I should stop drinking so much.

alcoholism,RipNastyy,2019/03/05,"Going Forward  

So yeah. This'll be a long one. And I guess pretty indulgent. Sorry in advance.

Turned 30 back in December, and I decided I wanted to go sober.  I did well for a few months, but this past weekend I relapsed hard.  I still feel proud of going those few months, but just being public about this at all feels like a really big deal to me. I've claimed that I was going to go sober before, but posting something feels like the best way I can hold myself accountable.

I wasn't a very social kid growing up. And I've realized through therapy the past year that it's pretty hard for me to feel genuinely happy or comfortable with myself, and I've never really liked myself at all. That's not to say I didn't have a good life. I'm really lucky to have a supportive, loving family and I never lacked for great friends. But I was never really comfortable in most social situations, and the idea of being vulnerable and putting myself out there, especially romantically, was just totally foreign to me. Like it felt like a guaranteed failure, so why put myself or others through that?

But then junior year of college I drank like 6 Bud Light Limes in an hour and all of a sudden I was smooth, confident and hilarious in groups. Who knew it was that easy? I moved up to Boston about a year after I graduated college, started taking improv classes, made friends, and finally became the kind of fun, social adult I always hoped I'd be. I had always wanted to do comedy, and getting more involved, it felt like maybe the first thing in my life that I might actually be pretty good at. But the theater is right next to a bar, and most shows are at bars, and oftentimes the folks who did the show would be social and hang out afterwards and like cool, I actually belong to this really fucking cool thing I've always wanted to do and we're going out afterwards, and I really want to go and hang out with them and be a part of this.

At first this felt pretty innocent. I'm in my 20s, I'm having fun, what's the issue? Over the last few years though I've learned that I've tied these two things together in a way that's become dangerous. If I'm out to do or see a show, or multiple shows in one night, I'm drinking the entire night. And no matter how many times I've told myself otherwise, I don't have the ability to regulate myself or stop drinking after a certain point, like other people do. And my constant anxiety doesn't let me go home because I want to be at the social event, but I can't be there sober because I'm boring and uninteresting and unfunny sober. So I stay, and I indulge. I've embarrassed myself, I've worried friends, I've damaged relationships, and I've put myself in danger numerous times.

So it's time to make a change, for real this time. And try to develop some real confidence in myself, and not rely on this stupid false confidence that drinking gives me. I honestly don't know if this will be a lifetime commitment, or what the right path forward is for me. But it's too much a part of my life right now, and I need to step away from it. For a long time.  


Thanks for reading, all.  I'm hoping to find a new community for this, so know I'm around to talk if anyone needs it.",4.602549742616187,5.453656956043957,5.877551750575009,79.30872731919246,69.70643642072214,9.190887517797817,27.843780803913692,9.411308987883313,2.3458019714504763,2519,83,492,52,43,847,278,637,0.087,0.6809999999999999,0.232,0.9988,0,0,4,0,0,0,72.0,0,0,1,5,19,41,4,1,34,3,40,11,0,3,10,107,90,53,0,14,21,0,10,9,4,3,3,1,1,2,37,36,6,2,15,11,1,19,12,7,1,5,17,15,49,34,73,59,17,97,0,1,1,2,24,35,1,17,52,323,86,7,0.0,0.0,0.11398873241333166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579166590463982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04467928197906571,0.0,0.0,0.040837783768290385,0.0,0.0,0.051992386704114366,0.0,0.0,0.0548729494970261,0.0449094547411726,0.0,0.07120568116495737,0.06450318068750242,0.049697927070302614,0.0,0.06129191857221376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061784215925900526,0.0,0.0,0.06311451498781569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06021247407649356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17164252298536234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05505856391831776,0.0,0.11812427848848712,0.08344837170537517,0.16823243465791296,0.06397927401436679,0.05338065412379212,0.09935767425863612,0.0,0.0,0.13536951346206233,0.053994018333876084,0.030513940241870232,0.05602691744708945,0.265540982330605,0.0979738457855397,0.0,0.06439116648367918,0.06433914038000277,0.0,0.0,0.06217267535775664,0.10463791882662772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058584474645415524,0.1160176916453437,0.05751666695873349,0.0,0.0,0.06593157050472633,0.0,0.060959123132964525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06081929832390383,0.06419517063132196,0.047607461940680725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0597225573926681,0.12375847489846052,0.2568013933747953,0.0,0.0,0.10337228770630057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05271234073432877,0.05526374924440401,0.03898545669179637,0.059212995175510486,0.058675169480571526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06195794399706527,0.0,0.0,0.0932358279982166,0.062074739637970736,0.042934026972922944,0.08661239213757413,0.13513545077105066,0.05640742920723287,0.06211384741596844,0.10961733202013747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07915280027004387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12649276217527167,0.11150740606470183,0.040490325888804815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05521112968616351,0.0,0.05593536567778135,0.2376734896719625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761379591884212,0.0,0.0,0.05842030422314429,0.13295421277823133,0.22449250607601404,0.0,0.0,0.06270457479866601,0.0,0.1496313694367153,0.0,0.046445601898070406,0.0,0.0,0.04654082415557476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564910408170119,0.0,0.2976801590868491,0.0,0.044962636820725696,0.0,0.06537905513622881,0.04133900509492512,0.06225142511333188,0.046641908454353884,0.04882877645823658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06627673349515666,0.0,0.0,0.0439129148208391,0.04694332408258803,0.0,0.053771015912705,0.06679063476484072,0.0,0.11640406215006704,0.0,0.05738212386549903,0.0,0.17028066561435715,0.0,0.0,0.05580800179448472,0.0,0.03965282114148338,0.063527323786092,0.057052709150446475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04818982840134728,0.17224243399468964,0.09271754581733506,0.0,0.0,0.052512658821835166,0.0,0.052700976231719265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05931260389468668,0.0,0.04148888047942876,0.0,0.0,0.1504423303080214
alcoholism,luigi787,2019/03/05,"Need advice in helping someone with alcoholism while I have his attention! My brother, who suffers from severe alcoholism, has finally taken the first step to seeking help. He called me last night, while intoxicated, and I told him I would help him. He currently drinks daily from the moment he wakes up, reportedly, several shots in the morning, mid day, and night. And light drinking here and there throughout the day. The problem is he just quit his job yesterday, has no health insurance, and I am in very tough place financially. Bipolar runs in our family, and I suspect he may have bipolar type 2, who’s depressive episodes may have been the reason for seeking refuge in alcohol. I have bipolar and was able to get help from a GREAT psychologist-psychiatrist who charges $250 per session. She diagnosed me on the first day and put me on the best medications for me when many failed to do. I am going to help him, but I’m curious as to what should be my plan of action. What step should I take first considering money is so limited? I told him last night I would schedule an appointment with my favorite psychologist, it was what first came to mind. He said he may not remember tomorrow about having called me, so I told him I would send him a text that night so he sees it in the morning. He is also having some thoughts of suicide. Thoughts of suicide happened once before when he was fired from his previous job—he took some pills, although it was not serious. He lives 4 hours away from me but I will do my best to get him here and he can stay with me as long as necessary.",5.359058693244741,6.631090598006648,5.720265780730897,79.58035437430789,68.26910299003322,9.454263565891472,31.94130675526025,9.725611199111238,3.019706090808417,1254,53,238,28,21,401,161,301,0.114,0.797,0.08900000000000001,-0.8452,3,0,5,0,0,2,34.0,1,0,0,10,11,9,0,0,12,0,31,14,1,1,0,38,48,23,2,7,5,1,1,0,0,9,11,1,0,0,10,13,5,1,6,2,1,9,3,6,0,4,14,4,36,3,34,24,4,47,0,3,1,0,40,12,0,5,25,158,46,5,0.08816189483722196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08615078328750657,0.0,0.2826547615100836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050303544931111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08283100231168179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07501927907609793,0.0,0.18504093894998647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18004630343913586,0.100833721097012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17057138615526654,0.0,0.07593371083840929,0.08948246746647309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17273018671314502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08311118824482402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657704647480173,0.0,0.29996185084406457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921219026088566,0.0,0.05010443652765705,0.0,0.0,0.09719880029686714,0.0,0.0,0.07796127244542646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09371197157590427,0.0,0.0,0.29546529868202515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08682170755332341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17497415404480904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437274222073863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07784856834205603,0.07802050263790238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938232380838441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08881383394675259,0.0,0.0,0.08901838165445966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06537092792648684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.330935864216757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09388954070865817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211041580209686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08435902683525041,0.0,0.08862705479015505,0.0,0.09377102722152413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09064511123551462,0.0,0.0,0.09987024071629026,0.0,0.08386215086097347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07025361582626273,0.0,0.0,0.19919569376077592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469928739941582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939688495831144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19286960739473025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06628677303440267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399813934430776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527274058359029,0.09795110906095496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07274279630126088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18788304181208093,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ImCold35,2019/03/05,"Helping a recovering Alocholic Hey guys, I hope this is the right place to ask. My mom is now a recovering alcoholic, dad has been recovering for as long as I can remember but relapsed for years. He claims to now be sober again. Mom is being discharged from rehab soon. I truly believe she will be sober for life after this because she wants it and she wants it for herself. I don't live with them but I want to know what I can do to best help her stay sober, especially during trying times. What are some of the little things that most people don't think of that helped you the most or would have helped? What advise can I offer for when she is tempted? Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,lindaholahola,2019/03/06,"Is he a functioning alcoholic? F(28) M(35) My parents would rarely drink when I was growing up so I'm not sure what a healthy amount of drinking looks like. My mother's dad was an alcoholic so that turned her away from alcohol completely. 

I have been dating this guy for 8 months and I did see a future with him but lately I have been questioning if he is a functioning alcoholic. I moved in with him about 4 weeks ago and I noticed that he drinks everyday after work. He doesn't get drunk but he will have 3-5 beers on weekdays. If there is no beer, he will have a little bit of whiskey. He holds down a good job and he's a driven and passionate guy. However, last Saturday he had to work from home. There was a 12 pack and a 6 pack in the fridge and by the time Sunday came around, only 4 beers were left. He will drink more during the weekends and I have seen him get drunk a couple of times when we go out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I brought up my concern last night and he mentioned that he actually used to drink more in the past but that he's controlled it and he mainly does it because he loves the taste of beer. I asked him if he has a dependency and then he said that he thinks he does but that ""everybody that climbs the corporate latter needs to function somehow."" Then I felt he started to deflect the convo. I told him that the excessive drinking is a deal breaker for me. He said ""ok"" and I started crying. HIs cold response is what got to me. I told him I don't think this is going to work out and I started packing. He left his apartment before I could say goodbye. I texted him and he texted back ""if you want to leave, feel free. I had enough of a bad day as it is."" I left him a note explaining my fears. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to somebody older about this (who grew up with an alcoholic) and he mentioned ""ah 3-5 beers a day is not bad at all. I think you're exaggerating."" 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?

alcoholism,doc_faced,2019/03/06,"How do you stick to the program when taking suggestions ruined your life I'm 28. Have been at the trying to get sober thing since 24. In that time, I got a grad degree, at near top of my class, at a top 20 program for my field in the US. But I was on the older end in my class. 

And, because the need to build sustained sobriety got massive, I listened to people (in rehab and people with long term recovery in AA) who told me that delaying licensing in my field multiple times was the right call. 

Now after going through that I know it was the wrong call. As was living in sober living for a month, I love my freedom and actually getting to use my car.

But now I'm working in a restaurant and in a below my pay grade job in my field. And I've relapsed but I want to get sober without delaying the career again or moving into sober living. 

Everyone just says take suggestions but I'm so jaded on that since the suggestions literally ruined my life. I mean I take responsibility for taking them but this makes me not want to take any more of them. 28, almost 29 is old as balls especially when you don't have a real job.

alcoholism,lisabrr,2019/03/06,"I am worried about my boyfriends escalating drinking, but unsure if its alcoholism? I have been with my partner for a year and a half now and recently his drinking seems to have escalated. I am sorry if this is long,I just need advice and to get an unbiased view about this. I will try to keep it understandable.

When we first met he told me he would sometimes have a shot or two of whisky a night so that he didn't wake up with the intense pins and needles and numbness he gets in his limbs most nights.

In the past he slipped into a depression and started not just drinking a decent amount on weekends but on week nights too but I spoke to him about this and he slowly wound back down to just weekends. It was hard for him but I kept trying to tell him during this time how proud I was of him. I have for the last few months become very busy and because of this have not been able to spend as much time with him as I would like,and he is not a social person so after I go to sleep several hours earlier than he needs to he is alone with no one to talk to or hang out with. Because of this he has been getting very drunk every night as he is lonely and his depression takes over.

He is a very dedicated worker and never misses a day. He works very hard with manual labour and comes home hurting every night. He also only ever drinks at night (aside from one time recently when we drank on a friday night and he woke up at 5am naturally so he got drunk at that point to fall back to sleep). 

I am worried that his drinking is escalating. I plan to spend the rest of my life with this person but I am afraid he is killing himself with the amount of whisky he drinks. He has a dark sense of humour sometimes and hides his feelings in jokes,and last night he told me he wants to die from alchohol poisoning like some famous person I had never heard of,this of course upset me and he simply told me he was joking. 

He suffers from depression and his mother was an alcoholic through most of his childhood.

I am completely unsure on how to bring the topic up with him and would really appreciate some advice on how the most sensitive way to brace the topic is as I don't understand the mindset. He flatly denies he has a problem as he doesn't start drinking when he wakes up,only a few hours before bed,but the amount he drinks and the dependency on it to sleep due to his pain worries me.

alcoholism,omgggg44,2019/03/06,"I think I have a problem with alcohol. I think I might be an alcoholic. I want to seek out help for this, but I don't know where to start. I was wondering if someone here could give me guidance.

I'm a 27 year old man living in Orange County, CA, and I have 2-3 drinks per night. My drinking really started to become an issue when I started law school in 2017. The stress of school led to me having a couple drinks at the end of the night, which has turned into a habit. I drink enough to where I'm buzzed, but not drunk. When I don't have alcohol, I feel anxious. My drinking is starting to affect my relationships. I take a low dose of Adderall (prescribed), which paired with the drinking turns me into a total monster. I'm mean to my boyfriend for no reason. I can see myself being mean as it happens, but I can't turn it off. I love him more than anyone in the world, and I keep ruining otherwise great nights, and it's honestly killing me. I know it's really hurting him too. I'm not suicidal, but I'm depressed all the time, and it feels as though I'm drowning.

I think I need help. I would appreciate any and all recommendations. I don't think I can afford rehab, but am open to AA, or any other groups that have helped you. I'm in kind of a panicked state at the moment, and a lot is going through my head. I've Googled Adderall and alcohol, and I'm wondering if I've permanently ruined my health/mental state. I just want to go back to being a happy person.

alcoholism,bubbathomp,2019/03/07,"Alcohol abuse in relationships... any advice would be amazing. I’m coming to you guys because I don’t know where to go from here. My SO and I have recently moved in together and things have seemed to be changing. I’ve suspected for a while, but more recently it’s been quite obvious that he has an alcohol problem. He’s drinking 15+ beers a night, daily, and if not that, then he’ll drink a half a fifth or more plus more beers. Says he can’t sleep. Tried confronting him about it and he doesn’t see a problem because this is entirely “normal” in his family and friend group. He got extremely defensive despite my efforts to seem calm and caring and nonjudgmental. He’s started to tell white lies to skirt the fact that he’s drinking, or has intentions of drinking. He’s started sleeping in the couch because he passes out drunk and leaves me to sleep by myself. He says he wants to marry me and has plans to get us a house this summer, but I can’t help but worry about this. For perspective, the alcohol is the main problem, but I’m growing more concerned about the lies and deceitful side of it as well. He would usually never try to mislead me and this is happening more frequently, which isn’t the guy I know. I love him, deeply. He’s been the best man I’ve ever met, and the last thing I want to do is leave. When he’s sober he’s a dream. Any advice on the situation, past experiences, what to do moving forward? I can’t imagine leaving, but I know if I’m intelligent and respect myself and the future I’ve worked for I can’t allow myself to marry an alcoholic. Depressed, stressed, confused. I’m afraid i already know what to do and don’t want to. He’s making me feel like I’m overreacting or something, but my guts telling me otherwise. Any advice would mean the world.

alcoholism,amber240,2019/03/07,"4 days sober. Will I always feel this horrible? I've been drinking for about 6 years. I would have 4 drinks a night on weekdays and on weekends I would lose count sometimes. I've been having trouble sleeping and I feel like I have a hangover all day which is pretty aggravating. I'm starting to lose my appetite and feel depressed. Looking back I'm ashamed of all the silly things I've done and the crazy angry outbursts towards my husband. 

When will this end? I know 4 days isn't that long but I need some sort of time line for motivation. I wish I put this addict to rest a long time ago.

alcoholism,llama1105,2019/03/07,"A child second to ̶n̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶ alcohol Imagine losing a parent early on in life. You’re supposed to miss them. To love them unconditionally. To think of them in pivotal moments. Reminisce on past times. Talk to them. Celebrate them...

But I don’t.

I am angry...And the older I get, the bigger the feeling. What happened that made alcohol #1? Genetics? Moving away from family and your support system? A miscarriage? Traveling spouse? An abusive prior relationship? All of these are BIG, I know. If they happened to me, I don’t know how I’d cope, but that’s not my point. The point is, I can’t help the way I feel. I can’t control the anger I have toward my mother. I’m now a mother too, and never could I let something take control and wedge itself between me and my child.  My son asks, “who is your mom?” And I have to brush the question off because I truly don’t know. My only positive memories are breakfast: sausage and jelly biscuits, cinnamon sugar toast, or cheese toast. I’m sure it’s because it was the only time you were remotely sober. Every other memory is littered with alcohol... 

Like when you took me to pick up my sister from soccer practice. We made it a mile down the road before you pulled over and passed out. I was probably 7 or 8. I was terrified and embarrassed. I sat and cried until someone found us and took me home.  They left you there. I wonder if you awoke in a panic. I wonder if you even remembered I was with you. I wonder if you cared.

Or when the ambulance came in the middle of the night and a paramedic shut my bedroom door before they took you out on a stretcher. That night you couldn’t find any alcohol in the house, so you went for the mouth wash. One of many times.  The next day at school I’d dread the question from my neighbor, “what was going on last night- is everyone okay?” I’d make up a lie, anything but the truth.

How about when you had visitation and we’d get in the car with you, but Dad told us if we stopped ANYWHERE to call him. Sure enough, you stopped at the gas station down the street and wouldn’t let us go inside with you. You bought some cheap liquor and downed it in the bathroom. My sister had to call my dad and tell him, then she had to break it to you that we weren’t getting back in the car. You were so pissed. 

If we did make it to your apartment you’d pass out shortly after and we’d search everywhere for Tupperware cups filled with vodka and dump them out. It was like hunting Easter eggs- and if I’m being honest, it was fun. I don’t think you ever confronted us. I don’t even know if we were doing it to help or hurt you? I’m sure you made promises of fun things we could do with our time together, but instead you’d pass out and we’d sit around bored, so I’m guessing it was our version of revenge.

Then there’s the time you were pulling into dad’s driveway after a visitation weekend and you pulled directly in front of an oncoming car. My sister was in the front seat. We surprisingly walked away without a scratch, but you walked away with two counts of child endangerment.

I’ve heard you went to multiple rehabs. California, Florida, Ohio. I can only assume they didn’t work because you weren’t ready. Alcohol was #1. Nothing could change that but you. But you made your choice, which definitely wasn’t your children. 

I don’t recall seeing you too often when the cirrhosis really set in. We came to the hospice center in your final days. You were sitting in bed, talking, smiling, seemingly happy. Sober. Weird. I wasn’t used to it. Your skin was so yellow it looked like it was painted on. You said your goodbye without startling us too much. I remember waiting in the hall and hearing you apologize to Dad, which was weird considering you two seemed to be enemies for the majority of the previous 5 years. On the way home, Dad was fighting to find the way to tell us that’d probably be the last time we saw you. 

You died 2 days before the start of my freshman year of high school. You never met a boyfriend. You didn’t come to my high school games. No homecomings, proms, graduations. No knowledge of my career, house, wedding, grandchildren. You don’t even truly know me. You’re missing out on so much. People say that it surely hurts you far worse than it hurts me, but I’ll probably never understand because at some point you had a choice- and you chose wrong. You let your pain manifest into mine, and I’m angry.

alcoholism,Hmdp19,2019/03/08,"Father had a relapse I’m not really sure how to start this post, but here goes. My Father has struggled most of his life with alcohol as a way to cope with things that have happened throughout his life. After battling with alcohol off and on for many months and even years, November of 2018 marked 1 year of sobriety. His entire life had changed for the better and my family and I, and all of his friends were more than ecstatic for him, our relationship returned to the way it used to be and we were able to do many things together again as Father and Son. Sadly as of roughly a week ago he has had a relapse and began to drink again. It crushes my heart to see him like this again and I’m not sure what to do..it’s devastating but I believe in him and always will.

alcoholism,trewcolours,2019/03/08,"Sudden Unexplained Death In Alcohol Misuse (SUDAM) I don’t really know if this post is meant for here, however I’m not too sure where else to put it. 

So my dad was an alcoholic for 30 years until he died 6 years ago (when I was 12). A lot went down however he recovered from a year of being in the hospital and when he finally got back up on his feet and got a flat he started drinking again. About 2 months later he died. 

On his death certificate it says SUDAM however I don’t see how this is a cause of death. I don’t understand how it would cause death. I don’t feel as though I have closure.

alcoholism,cranberryorange_,2019/03/09,"Is it considered alcoholism if it doesn't affect certain areas of your life ? I think my husband has a problem. He drinks 7 days a week, anywhere from 8-18 drinks (mostly beer) per day. He gets extremely rude, belligerent, and violent towards everyone (me and our kids).

He spends all of his money on alcohol, and gets pissy at me, treating me rudely for several hours when he is out of money and I refuse to buy him some. He has stolen money from me to buy alcohol.

And yet, when I tell him he needs help, he says he does not because he can still function and go to work without needing to drink. 

I'm at a loss. Divorce is my next option if he doesn't stop drinking. But I don't want to break apart our family. I've made him leave the house when he drinks. I've left while he drinks. His family had talked to him.

alcoholism,MissKyouNtea,2019/03/09,"Lies to Save Lives (Original Removed but updated to abide by rules)  

**Discussion**: A friend of mine posted an article, that made me chuckle, about someone willing to pose as a couples therapist for $250 an hour, and will tell the person's significant other that they're wrong in all of the scenarios they discuss. So I began to wonder in other areas that a situation like this might actually be helpful, and even possibly, productive.

**Setting**: A Raging Alcoholic, severely depressed, suffering with PTSD, and a LARGE family history of Alcoholism.

The Alcoholic has been forced through numerous attempts to get sober, as well as, taken own steps to attain sobriety, and who has almost killed himself, and others, over several instances spanning 15 years.

**Scenario**: A family hires an actor to play a specialist doctor, that tells the alcoholic, that their liver is severely damaged, and a short time away from needing surgery, if they don't stop drinking.

Even though this is not the case, it's an attempt to scare him into sobriety.

**Question**: What could go wrong?",5.170257437070936,8.306342902173919,5.7585812356979424,71.02509153318081,73.78260869565217,9.525858123569792,34.140732265446225,9.811843763644266,4.464526086956521,850,45,123,26,19,274,135,184,0.219,0.6609999999999999,0.121,-0.9802,0,0,5,0,0,0,48.0,0,0,3,3,6,14,2,1,17,0,11,7,1,2,1,22,18,13,1,3,3,0,0,1,1,3,5,0,0,1,13,8,5,1,2,3,0,3,2,8,1,0,4,0,8,6,25,9,2,20,0,3,0,0,14,8,0,5,8,90,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.11494343970518593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5035153227552996,0.11794699321474973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11066507063323494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940435958233271,0.1303294364978062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10145005177839173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12056031981971725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153867379340296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15559483664013876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2220788173712199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100219632308794,0.0,0.06153901663966304,0.0,0.06694125209915043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895036214889496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11599679022031527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13031422520425445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05754493809392078,0.0,0.10400836732425782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145321637796787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12495373971280407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08733781017309403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284735029104347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13278751283548515,0.11280769942871352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13768708153965062,0.0,0.13194876265329114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11792566206079365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3991984565801325,0.0,0.0,0.13239789015904446,0.0,0.0,0.09980081956756444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09847547917900873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20590263021570074,0.0,0.0,0.13676016460397392,0.0,0.0,0.11572545031508907,0.0,0.06868273734295392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10590495227475076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127735331193089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2575639020777353,0.0,0.07585117650121917
alcoholism,anniza,2019/03/09,"I don't know how I got here For about the past 6-8 months I have been drinking everyday. i don't even know how this started honestly, I just kept telling myself 'it's fine you can stop whenever you want to"" ... and that's clearly not true. I'm only 23 and I can't believe I'm already this fucked up. Lately I'll wake up feeling hopeful and I tell myself ""today we aren't going to drink"" and then it's the end of the day and I'm alone with my thoughts and I just want my brain to shut up so I end up drinking. I don't know who to go to about this. I have bipolar disorder so I know this alcohol use is not good for me for a multitude of reasons. I'm seeing a new psychiatrist in a month or so but I'm afraid to tell any doctor about this because I don't want this to go in my file forever. I've tried to stop on my own and the most of I've lasted is three days. I wish I'd never started drinking in the first place.

anyway, he got upset and wouldn’t talk to me and i said “i was only trying to help” and he said “i didn’t ask for help” and i said “what am i suppose to do, watch you hurt yourself” and he said “i do it every night”

i don’t know who else to tell because no one knows how bad it is and i’m ashamed. that just was like a dagger to the heart because he always told me he doesn’t judge me and that my problem doesn’t define me.

alcoholism,rscott555,2019/03/09,"From Alcohol to Transvestites? Yes! I’ve been going to AA for 25 years. My life has completely transformed but I find myself living with some might consider a double life. I’m a single straight guy but for some reason I have felt a draw to transvestites. I understand that this channel is about alcoholism but we alcoholics sometimes wander into different behaviors that have addictive personalities.  

I love sex. I’m a guy. That’s kind a how it goes with guys. I’ve wandered into porn addiction at various stages in my life. I find that when I am aroused sometimes I wonder on two different sites where I can see transvestites. Although I am straight and have never been attracted to men this is always been a little confusing to me. It’s been a journey that I’ve been working through for about 12 years. 

This is my first time posting on this platform and I am concerned about anonymity. Obviously this is not a topic that I like to talk openly about in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings... LOL.

Again… I am single. I think sex is a natural part of the human experience and I wander back-and-forth between why is this transvestite thing a draw for me and I’m single and not hurting anyone (except myself re the secrecy that is involved in the activity) so why not just roll with it.  

Part of the reason I am posting this is to come out of the shadows and to find out if other alcoholics have had this experience. 

I understand this is not the traditional post for this platform but we alcoholics grapple with various challenges in life and I think that it’s good to talk about it.

alcoholism,Trey100197,2019/03/10,"I need to stop but alcohol makes me happier. I love to drink and I’ve had friends tell me I need to slow down and I think I agree after Friday night. My father is an alcoholic and so is my brother so I see the damage it can do but I understand why they drink. I only feel happy when I’m drunk. When I’m sober I’m awkward, I lack confidence, I’m told I’m annoying. But alcohol makes me feel so much better. I gain confidence and everyone seems to love my company. Friday night I went out alone and it was a blur. I live in a college town and I went to a bar near campus. I ended up losing my wallet and everything in it and my phone died while I was there. I passed out face first in the parking lot after being thrown out when a group of people picked me up and asked if I was okay. I asked to borrow their phone and called my father. He told me I put myself in that situation and I can only get out of it (fair enough). I stumbled home on a major highway 7 miles. I passed out right inside my door. I woke up with the worst hangover I’ve ever had. Although it is Sunday I quit drinking. Usually I’ll spend my whole weekend wasted but not this time. I can’t keep up like this. I know my story is probably nothing compared to some people’s but it was a wake up call for me. Thanks for reading.

alcoholism,justanotherexcuse,2019/03/10,"How Can I Help? To keep this brief - my father is a high-functioning alcoholic. He drinks daily, and rather than getting better as he ages, his addiction seems to be getting worse. I'm in my mid-twenties, living at home at the moment. However, after years of broken promises and numerous failed attempts at breaking the cycle, things have escalated to the point where my parents are splitting, with my mother moving out of the home, and myself following suit. 

My father acknowledges that he needs help, but doesn't believe a doctor can help - he is also too proud for Al-Anon. While I'm terrified at the thought of what might happen once my mother moves out, it's also inevitable at this point.

I guess my question here is how can I help him? I know he's going to feel abandoned and incredibly hurt once we've left the home, but it's necessary for self-preservation, having a safe space of our own. I'm at a loss here.

alcoholism,wlwsapphics,2019/03/10,"Need some advice for first AA meeting So I’m (20F) going to my first AA meeting this week and I’m a little nervous and scared.

I’m not entirely sure what advice I’m after, but if anyone could give me some pointers on what happens at meetings I’d appreciate it.

I’m also a little put off getting help because of my age. I’m from the UK where you can drink legally at 18 but I still feel too young to be an alcoholic and I’m worried about other people attending the meeting thinking that of me (which I realise is a little self absorbed but trust me if I could stop it I would)  Has anybody else started AA fairly young?

alcoholism,iphone1234567891011,2019/03/10,"My story I am 31, I loved drinking all my life. I have been doing it for around 15 years, drinking more and more. I am now drinking a lot and I can see that it is too much.  


I am now in a point in my life that I feel does not require this much alcohol and would like to slow down. Can you guys share some advice?   


I need to lower down drinking and keep the high dopamine and find some other pleasure. I thought a lot of sex or dedication to business could help me.  


I feel I am in a good position because I don't have all the normal stuff - girlfriend, driving license, business. But I have this great job, that I so much wanted all this life. I feel like it's time to pick up the pieces and create something special.

alcoholism,jmerc926,2019/03/10,"I don’t know what to do anymore A little backstory here..I’m 23 and have always had issues with substance abuse since the age of 14. A couple of years back I got real help and counseling. Things were going good. I still smoked weed every other day or so, but I was feeling emotionally and physically healthy. Since then I’ve been slowly working my way back to my addiction. Opiates were my doc and since stopping I haven’t touched them. I’ve picked up drinking hard liquor every day all day when the clock hits 11. Sometimes sooner. I feel like I’m slowly losing control and I can’t comfort myself because I don’t know why I’m drinking like this. Before I got help it was obvious to me and others what I had to “deal” with and work through to get “better”. Now I don’t know. At least before there was always this thought of “well as soon as I deal with this shit I can stop being an addict”. Now there is no hope. This is just who I am I guess. (I obviously love my one man pity party..sorry to complain). I think I’m just writing this so I can feel comforted or to justify my addiction for another day.

alcoholism,cody2897,2019/03/10,"Concerns over a friend's use I'm posting here as I haven't had to deal with alcohol for a very good portion of my life, and only recently, since I turned 21 in october, have I had to be around my friends while they were drinking. Personally, I don't drink, but I don't let that stop my friends from drinking on the night out or wherever we are.

Recently a friend and I have gotten closer and I've started to notice his drinking habits being excessive. When I bring it up to him, or anyone really brings it up - even an older friend of ours he really trusts and loves, he always repeats himself saying, he'll only drink socially or at conventions, and when he does, he plans to binge and get wasted so he can have a good time.

He's very addiment in thinking that his drinking behavior is alright. Just a second ago when I brought it up with him, he said, ""the amount I order is fine. If I haven't vomited yet, I haven't met my limit. Because I know my limits. ... That's why when I start getting even the tiniest bit of nausea I quit."" He went on to say after I mentioned a time that wasn't the case, 'That's called pacing. I wait for the nausea to go away and then go for some more.'

I'm conflicted on his behavior with drinking. To me, he's smart about everything when it comes to alcohol except for the amount. But then again, I'm not sure if what he's doing is actually fine, then I have a couple of people backing me up that are his friends that agree with everything I've said and also get on his case about it.

I don't know enough about the topic, and I really would like some input on what you all think and possible things to do. Please and thank you.",5.993038348082592,5.1069123893805335,6.687743362831862,80.65898967551624,66.69911504424778,10.12920353982301,30.92772861356932,9.444778638647367,2.4649657817109145,1296,41,273,22,18,429,168,339,0.02,0.7979999999999999,0.182,0.995,0,0,9,0,0,0,40.0,2,2,1,4,18,17,0,0,15,1,26,12,0,1,2,44,55,30,0,3,10,0,0,1,6,2,4,4,0,1,15,19,9,5,4,7,0,7,8,0,0,1,10,4,39,17,45,40,9,51,1,0,0,1,41,18,0,7,25,183,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.08184721558515279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07434768752120569,0.1792678524223834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06707260663185192,0.06978842941860239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05864542611076876,0.0,0.0,0.07466408290124264,0.0,0.0,0.0788007381464841,0.06449258178754022,0.0,0.0511277440656433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09156677237880652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564294295367254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07224851532017301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0928030474247775,0.0,0.0,0.08646860513869188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07339716965802243,0.0,0.0,0.5751401095794394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08666245291846655,0.0,0.11079365791632473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15075793724581155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3887969457125336,0.0,0.13145936405044506,0.0,0.0953330630465208,0.14069612509837376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09218798839056076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857650563652144,0.059241449343574684,0.040975743949264364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756979786464587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07870842333072695,0.0,0.0,0.0954891105462953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12757724846099328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05814645644303184,0.0732340120777939,0.0,0.0920665422267685,0.0,0.0945533578770381,0.08032642940291672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08920846006433075,0.0,0.0,0.16119212972233898,0.0,0.16562745346798413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595634292949881,0.13339715640487107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06937999047312786,0.0,0.0,0.08549719482047463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11873041801399478,0.0,0.0,0.07012095509659529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904860139839816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07721829760649436,0.0,0.0,0.055720994921013685,0.10748390014497412,0.0,0.0,0.09781316488710486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09122892158523484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243869338454736,0.0,0.13840677725495232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775041441774266,0.0756816585615625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059580438752019835,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,acidgiggle,2019/03/10,"Rehab 3 times - starting ketamine infusions! I’m a 25 year old female who just spent her birthday in the hospital for alcohol withdrawal. I had about 4 months and was doing great. I’m in college and work full time but one day I was driving by the liquor store after work and had the next 3 days off and something just.... told me I could handle it. 2 weeks later and a fifth of vodka a day I was back where I was just 4 months ago. Couldn’t even go to work. I tried to detox by myself but starting hallucinating - which has never happened. Ended up in the hospital with my mom by my side on my birthday.

Long story short I saw a psychiatrist and he recommended ketamine infusions which is a new experimental treatment that has had really high success rates. I had my first one Friday! And I have never felt better about myself - I had an experience where I was able to look at myself as if I was someone else and I told myself to give myself some compassion and deserved it. It was mind blowing. The plan is to continue these treatments for the next 6 weeks. I am hopeful for the future! I am also taking those vivitrol pills which I should of tried forever ago. They have been making me pretty nauseous but I am willing to try everything and anything. 

Here’s to another 24 - I want so badly to be healthy and happy. 

Have any of you done ketamine infusions? Any advice? I am feeling positive and hopeful.

alcoholism,ApartDisaster,2019/03/10,"I failed my third attempt to quit alcohol! I feel like a mess. I could last 3 months with no alcohol but eventually I dragged myself back into it. I am going back to drinking everyday as soon as I get home after work and passing out and waking up the next day and going through the same cycle.   
it may also be worth mentionion that my uncle has joined AA around 15 years ago and he actually sponsers some people. I did talk to him a little about his experience ( last summer ) and he is a person I really feel comfortable with but I just worry about telling him about my problem.  He is also in another country and I feel really stuck in this , I have never walked in an actual AA meeting because I am worried I would be judged or mocked because I am only 23!  


Is there any advice you guys can give me?   
Has anyone felt like me and do you know how can I find people to talk to?   
What kind of environment does AA have ?

alcoholism,Mercury48,2019/03/10,"My poem on alcoholism: Blood of the Devil Blood of the Devil, you are my killer

the ache in my liver

is making me shiver

you agony giver.

&amp;nbsp;

But I don't care about anything at all,

while you are with me, oh sweet ethanol!

I can barely stand, I try to crawl,

I fall over and I start to bawl.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to vomit, stomach in flames,

when you are gone, only guilt remains.

So I keep going, I drink the stains,

alcoholism,Downscapes,2019/03/10,"Just got out of the hospital again. I just got out of the hospital for the 9th time in 10 years for drinking. I got out of rehab in December. Made it almost 3 months this time. I go to AA almost every day and practice the the principles. Apparently I called the suicide hotline and got picked up by the police. This I only have vague memory off. Why do I keep relapsing? I do have other alcoholics in my life. I live with two and ones boyfriend is extremely invasive and abusive alcoholic too. I can’t escape the horrors of alcohol. So I guess it’s just cool for me to get back into it right? Nope. I can’t leave my current living situation due to a nephew and other circumstances currently. Maybe I need a sponsor? I go to AA cuz I like it, but I’m introverted and pretty antisocial/ socially anxious so I’ve never tried getting a sponsor in the past. I’ve been drinking heavily for 11 years now and I only ever get sober for a few months and go back to it. Any wisdom would be appreciated. I have many hobbies too. I think it’s that I can’t escape addiction and it’s issues being all around me even when I’m sober.

alcoholism,passthemilk1,2019/03/11,"Father's side of the family is addicts. Dealing with recent deaths. Just looking to quickly vent and see if anyone has any advice or insight. Hi:) I hope whoever is reading this is well. My father is an alcoholic, I am 20 years old and I have never once seen him without a beer in his hand. He and my mother are divorced and while he visited quite a few times while I was growing up and we are on good terms, he is still an alcoholic who has had little to no effect on my life. His brother is even more of an alcoholic than he is. He currently is homeless. Actually, he in hospice at the moment as a result of his seizures from his addiction. His daughter (my cousin) overdosed on heroin in July of 2018. This past weekend, there was a remembrance for her at my (alcoholic) grandmother's (father's mom, of course) house, and at this remembrance, her brother overdosed on heroin and died. I also have a half brother who I have met once when I was young, but have heard about occasionally from my father. For a long time, I had heard he was on heroin as well. Recently, I got some mixed messages from my father about his condition. He said he is ""doing better."" But then again, my dad is a habitual liar, so who knows how my half brother is actually doing. I can only assume that it's not good. I live with my amazing mother who very much has limited my interaction with this side of the family my entire life- however, I cannot help but know that it is a part of me. Addiction obviously runs in the blood and I am fearful for my future? This post stems from a conversation I had with a friend today regarding the inner-city gang problem (unrelated) and he told me that a father in the home is the single most important indicator of future success. I told him it was debatable. He does not know my circumstances; really no one does. I feel as though I am on a pretty good path in life. I have never really opened up about my father's side of the family as I have not found it to truly affect me. However, perhaps I am wrong. Idk. Just thought I would throw some things out there and see if anyone had anything to say.

alcoholism,freeandirie,2019/03/11,"My drinking is getting out of control As many that post on here, I've come to the realization that I'm drinking far too much...daily. I moved from a small town to the city of Harrisburg pa 6 months ago, I haven't met anyone out here and I just work and sit home alone. Being away from my family and not having a group of friends like I did back home I've found myself doing nothing but drinking to ease the boredom, depression, and loneliness of being in a city knowing not a single person other than people I work with. 

Basically I'm drinking not just beer but cheap ice beers...I'll easily put down 5-6 25 ounce natty ice a night...sometimes more when I'm not getting as drunk as I like. They're only a 1.05 at this hood bar couple blocks down from my place. I notice I'm tired all the time, my nutrition is terrible, and my sleeping pattern is so irregular because I usually pass out and not fall asleep. It's like I feel numb everyday....I dont enjoy anything until I get to the stage of inebriation that I enjoy and then I either do something dumb, message my ex, or want to talk to everyone I see. I guess basically I'm just posting this because I know I need to slow down and if I have no friends out here maybe I can befriend some people on here. just having people to talk to can make a huge difference. Much love n thanks everyone ",3.2974404761904736,4.699306566176472,4.775399159663866,83.89495098039217,73.41176470588233,7.680952380952381,26.555322128851554,8.269060116576782,1.7036160364145654,1054,37,213,17,21,353,157,272,0.14400000000000002,0.7240000000000001,0.132,-0.6575,0,1,7,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,0,3,12,13,1,0,12,0,15,12,2,2,1,40,36,19,0,3,14,2,1,3,2,0,2,0,2,1,7,14,7,2,4,7,1,5,8,4,0,0,3,2,25,9,35,31,6,35,0,1,1,1,11,17,1,4,12,131,32,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09819081998843376,0.0,0.0,0.11472419488768243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745287944221595,0.0,0.0911541775282102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407195371194576,0.08517520450227191,0.0,0.1350485880958273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541844808839943,0.0,0.0,0.12423784549867245,0.0,0.1225647713853284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09540594003456472,0.0,0.0,0.11573095413807345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12982148078883599,0.4340492688624858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21169074499363566,0.0,0.0,0.10442398974496384,0.0,0.05600858235156959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121453461987495,0.17116107746065168,0.0,0.17361807988432104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202551714222905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222224534829052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12175246433282172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16234971249913285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09997414637331804,0.0,0.07393975868724875,0.11230327783611073,0.111283238429776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841546576834923,0.11773085809127312,0.16285722231992025,0.08213446650895835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395003374700144,0.0,0.10628669257983632,0.1261122487748208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424548937504016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303816740474104,0.09671999139059208,0.11573095413807345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2121738612936894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135432973562216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08826925728673081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108498821471976,0.0,0.0,0.08527606955458436,0.1095542490992316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17806527608918649,0.0,0.1019820281287161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06459081099993404,0.12731368842860938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12199737938337657,0.0,0.06533494839346922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16128359175666054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I feel surprisingly confident that i can quit drinking altogether if i just knew that quitting cold turkey wouldn’t kill me.

alcoholism,lisek46,2019/03/12,"My father's alcohol problem is very damaging to my mother, in what ways could I help her? To cut the story short, my mother was brought up by an alcoholic herself and growing up in that environment has influenced the way she is a lot. My father has problems with alcohol misuse. Not a completely severe one but still. He's had periods of that for a few years but over the past 2 years it got more frequent and with some more messed up incidents. 

I can mostly handle that, but I'm really worried about mum. Now after a period has ended she's a bundle of broken nerves. She's mostly very tough and reserved on the surface like a lot adult children of alcoholics, but recently she can tear up over a smallest thing from stress. She feels worthless for not being able to deal with the situation and feels like she's failing at everything. At times she has to relieve the tension with fury at my father (I know it may bring him even more down but I really can't blame her for that either). 

I'm really sorry for her. She's not good with feelings and I'm not either. It's difficult to talk about it. The easiest way for me to cope is to isolate but maybe I'm not giving her the support she might need. I know I can't replace a therapist (she was getting some help but I'm don't know whether she's still getting that or not, she works a lot) but I'd like to do the least I can. 

I try to appreciate everything she does and assure her it's not her fault things are like this, but I'm really awkward at doing so. Do you think there are any words of support she might want to hear?

I doing a mini-study on alcohol abuse, specifically how age of first use is correlated to alcohol addition/dependency in later life. It's 13 short questions and takes just a couple minutes. Every response is greatly appreciated and will help me immensely. I'll share the results with all after my study concludes in a week.

alcoholism,NobleChris2,2019/03/12,"Can anyone help me understand the mind of an alcoholic? I’ve tried in so many ways to understand my brother and I just don’t get it. 
3 years ago from today I was overweight, addicted to porn, lonely, ate fast food, addicted to video games. Since then I’ve limited fast food to only a few times a month. Started going to the gym regularly, started cooking and making nutritious meals, I’m now down to 14% body fat at 190 lbs. recently I’ve quit porn for about 4 months, decided to quit wheat for a month now. Haven’t touched a video game in months either. 

Since 3 years ago my brother has been to the hospital 3 times for acute pancreatitis from drinking so much vodka. How can someone not quit a drug with their life on the line? I can’t relate. I’ve tried to quit all my negative habits that don’t provide value to my life with no real benefit besides feeling good about myself just to get some insight to what my brother is going through and I get nothing. While quitting activities that provide dopamine is a challenge it’s just a game and all games can be beat if you put your mind to it. Why do only some of us have the ability for self improvement while it seems some of us want to create problems for ourselves?",4.556865999511835,5.704723622406642,5.215172077129608,82.92223090065905,70.03734439834025,8.492164998779595,30.359043202343177,8.841846274778883,2.3811150109836468,967,39,190,17,17,312,138,241,0.065,0.838,0.097,0.6747,0,2,4,0,0,0,21.0,2,2,1,8,10,5,0,0,13,0,15,17,2,2,2,31,30,11,0,3,6,3,2,0,0,0,8,0,0,1,7,6,9,1,6,10,0,3,7,2,0,0,3,2,16,3,34,26,8,30,0,1,0,2,14,5,0,5,21,112,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21470731950359134,0.0,0.0,0.17458652669941035,0.10524117409287126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06885689113441297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10938492569963182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09646924513417626,0.11420119821179905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04979255626580088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2381557705399631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15434934519741694,0.0,0.1119326566287671,0.08259721525966993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06600656172400178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911339037389392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06573366866535944,0.09983947184000999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19886590166276252,0.0,0.3144112469337762,0.0,0.07239138240239197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09449062801424522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14979126747095975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422848193367936,0.0,0.09899584128013783,0.0,0.5237081244252664,0.0,0.11208754381819268,0.0,0.0,0.09723342712843608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08964908918714372,0.10273221673360106,0.0,0.0,0.16292116087251154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08343861608220132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13940400828687602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11484459902162825,0.0,0.09334398057039306,0.0,0.0,0.1337178336612645,0.0,0.0,0.20503452057948174,0.23690963300240456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05808384996400191,0.07816587201227368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885950823517702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12683096637666155

alcoholism,ropindog,2019/03/13,"My friend is killing himself drinking and i cant help him. I posted this in stop drinking but i think this might be the better sub

Not sure if this is the place to post but i had to get this off my chest. Last weekend an old friend and i went to my cabin to ride snowmobiles. He drank a 5th one day and on the way home killed the better part of a gallon of whiskey straight in like 4 hours. Tried to fight me and a stranger at the restaraunt. When we got back to my place (i was driving his truck) he passed out for 4 hours then tried to fight me again in my own house when i took his keys. I kicked him out and the next day he said hes going to rehab. The problem is the rehab is within walking distance of his house and an outpatient facility. I am a recovering meth addict myself and my red flag radar was going off. He has talked about just killing himself and i fear that if he dosent get a medical detox in an inpatient rehab he will die. Im lost and dont know how to get through to him. I know from my own recovery that you cant help someone when they dont want it. Im scared for my friend but i had to back away from him for my familys sake. Thanks for letting me vent.

alcoholism,PM-ME-HOT-PICS,2019/03/13,"I don’t think i want my mom at my graduation I graduate university in about 5 months, my mom is extremely excited (as well as all my family), but i remember leaving for my first year and telling her i wasn’t sure if i wanted her at my graduation if she didn’t at least try to stop drinking. Well now here we are, she’s still drinking around ~0.5l of vodka most days (even more the past couple of weeks, her excuse being work). 

I just don’t know what to do anymore, i get phone calls from her once or twice a week, only when she’s drunk, and i can’t stand it. I’ve worked hard to get through uni, and i would love her to be able to see me graduate, but it will crush me that she’ll inevitably start drinking during it, but it’ll also crush me if i can’t have her there for it.

alcoholism,Beaky1505,2019/03/13,"4.5 months and I want to have a drink I'm just struggling with anger and I'm pissed off at my boyfriend. my brother who sexually abused me as a child has moved in to my mum's house. I'm moving house because I've just had enough of living in a toxic environment. I feel like I'm not being a good enough mother to my child and want to take full responsibility for him. 

Had various health things crop up recently and doctors worried about ovaries. 

And I'm just fucking fed up and finding it difficult to find the right sponsor. 

I know there's no excuse to drink or use drugs now. 

I'm just struggling with everything. 
And I just want that release.

alcoholism,peppermintsheet,2019/03/13,"I need help Today I woke up at home and started remembering the night before. For the first time in my life i went out alone because none of my friends were up to going out on a tuesday. I got extremely drunk and behaved accordinly. I can remember that i wanted to go home from the last bar i was at. After that i remember that i sort of ”woke up” very far from my actual home and hitched a ride to the nearest train station. I have no idea how i ended up there at 6 in the morning. All i remember is coming home. I feel extremely low, scared and embarrased of my own behaviour. What scares me the most is not remembering how or why i went so far from my home and that i let myself get to this state. What happened over there i will never know.

The reason i’m posting this is that i need someone to hear me and tell me that i’ll be ok. I need someone to encourage me to completely stop drinking so i don’t endanger myself like this ever again. It’s not like this was the first time this happened.  I need to hear from someone that they’ve been through the same and have ended up ok.

alcoholism,wooofofwallstreet,2019/03/13,"Its been 5 days, and I remember why I drink. So I've gone through the hard part of the withdrawals, the shivering, waking up with a start every 15 minutes to gulp down some more water. Even got some hallucinations, and I think I was delirious for at least a day there but I can't remember that part too much (thankfully).

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really sleep much still, but I can feel like that is improving with time. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now the depression is coming back, which I've finally realized, was the real reason I drank so much in the first place. The crushing loneliness and feeling like there is no point. If any of you guys are religious, send a prayer out for me.  I don't know if there is a God, but I hope he can redeem me, fix me, give me a purpose to live and let me be reconnected with my family. I will never take them for granted again if I can help my dumbass from doing it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I started cleaning my wreck of a room today, found some unopened whippets lying around, but I put them in that whip dispenser and released that gas into the air, so I wouldn't be tempted to do them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to figure out how to live now. I know I can't go back to drinking or drugs. Next time the withdrawals might be bad enough to give me full blown seizures. I don't think I can quit smoking yet though, still need to chain smoke for a bit yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Respect to all you bastards who have put up with this and gotten further through this than I have. Hope to get to where some of you sober bastards have fought to get, I look up to you guys. And I understand those who are still lost like me. 

But until then, I guess I gotta keep gulping down water like a fish and applying to jobs in my home state of Texas like my life depends on it.

alcoholism,Brosiusaurus,2019/03/13,"My wife I’m 25 years old, been married to my wife for 4 years. Ever since we were dating I knew she had a problem with alcohol, but know it’s worse than I could of imagined. She’s dealt with severe depression since she was 12 &amp; has been through so many different medications &amp; treatments. Her meds has been less &amp; less effective over the years, so she’s turned to alcoholism. She drinks every night until she blacks out, wakes up late and then goes right back to it. Her health is declining, she’s gained over 100lbs in 4 years and the doctor has already found red flags to do with her liver (I’m sure her antidepressants make it even worse). I spend so many nights wondering if it’ll be the last time I see her alive...

I love her dearly, and I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel so alone &amp; that know one around me will be understanding. I don’t what to do but pray.

alcoholism,Alias4444,2019/03/14,"Did my dad have an alcohol-induced seizure? My dad (60) is a chronic alcoholic. Has been long before I (26f) was born. I'm talking 6oz cup of 20% APV soju multiple times a day, EVERY DAY. He is 5'8, 115lbs. He's emaciated because all that goes in his system is alcohol. He's a pack-a-day smoker too so I don't know how he's made it this far without...well, dying. 

My mom tells me around 9 in the morning, she suspected something was odd with my dad. He kept flipping the switch to the fan above the stove on and off again. She noticed the stove was on. She asked what he was doing, and he said he couldn't get the stove to turn off. He couldn't grasp that the stove knob (which he used to turn the stove on in the first place) and the fan switch turned on/off two different things.

Then shortly after, he went into the living and started pacing in a circle. He suddenly collapsed on the couch and started having what she described as a seizure. He wasn't convulsing, but his eyes rolled back and his body started tensing and twisting like someone who was possessed. This happened once before a couple of months ago.

My mom took him to the family doctor who reported he was having a hypertensive crisis (blood pressure was 210/-forgot diastolic #). He is complaining of a headache but refuses to go to the ER. 

Has anyone experienced this before? I read this can be from alcohol withdrawal, but he's never stopped drinking...",3.5977173913043465,5.487335221014494,4.481304347826086,84.3071739130435,73.60144927536231,7.553623188405798,27.94202898550725,8.321376580360154,1.9957115942029,1115,44,214,19,23,360,160,276,0.068,0.895,0.036000000000000004,-0.8577,1,0,7,0,0,0,49.0,0,0,0,1,6,3,0,1,23,0,25,9,3,3,2,26,43,14,1,2,3,5,0,1,0,0,5,1,6,0,13,10,4,3,3,2,0,3,5,2,1,2,15,3,17,1,25,25,1,37,0,0,1,0,37,15,0,0,19,123,30,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789216650445937,0.4720770488853052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07721730169378703,0.0,0.0,0.09830875820026676,0.10323992143368696,0.0,0.0,0.08491613882203998,0.0,0.06731891470926778,0.0,0.2819109761134841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12266613652383793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12219198301273852,0.0,0.2136603930805746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461198978395536,0.11537895124553127,0.0,0.11303282625386925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818227025609513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09304454181718484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10410637768762984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09393422954038164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05769666989990335,0.0,0.06276160289765792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09765551239988723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06069107332131848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05395197191817688,0.0,0.09751433747265766,0.09772970506778947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10449434823268773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2586755241407697,0.08814654463201442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08517271595768704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572867052918765,0.0,0.11760751100249607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11537895124553127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046285669752937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050470452366949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09356949877906123,0.08501669708702457,0.0,0.0,0.2344950778607933,0.0,0.0,0.09232690942552542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08876183974040777,0.09652328502939007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0733667595383678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06439435403236686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1226950952112884,0.0,0.36035808562156796,0.10787696707328777,0.0,0.0,0.0953786307360672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023724713939691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645344416634957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,betsy333www,2019/03/14,"Dealing with stigma and feelings of shame. So, about a month ago, I confided in a friend that I was an alcoholic (I’m in recovery)... I wish I could take that back now. She is the mom of one of my daughter’s friends, but has been a good friend to me also. Suddenly since that time, she’s refusing to carpool to activities that we used to ride-share to. She always takes just her daughter and picks up just her daughter and, even though I offer to drive one way, she refuses the offer. Maybe I’m being sensitive, or *assuming* it’s because of what I told her, but... nothing else has changed. This new decision to not let her daughter ride with me has been since the day we talked about my having a problem with alcohol. I’m crushed. I never drove drunk. Ever! This just makes me realize, I guess, that there’s such a stigma to alcoholism. :(",3.0174025974025973,4.851809515151518,4.167640692640696,86.1743181818182,75.06060606060606,7.865800865800867,27.54329004329004,8.634040054169528,2.047874458874459,650,26,132,13,14,212,98,165,0.1,0.799,0.101,-0.3156,0,0,3,0,0,0,34.0,2,0,0,0,14,6,0,1,9,0,11,4,0,3,2,30,23,9,0,3,7,5,1,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,9,8,4,2,4,1,0,3,2,2,0,2,5,1,23,4,20,15,0,17,0,0,0,0,25,3,0,3,10,94,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13018557010712858,0.4708570302774786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11744663249207687,0.1222021393489942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11292891289048912,0.0,0.08952658423409147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15536203631318046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172584990493783,0.0,0.0,0.09471476311042278,0.15140974832792267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1226855512685766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09700191089317288,0.13284638118264924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742585633279164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403989668075401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12318207780552252,0.0,0.0,0.16178662647536246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15017780822020632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09803248042349437,0.0,0.14754405595201708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17200467507015665,0.11722498924742362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11327013161996885,0.14184161656008806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14091942271117622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1990369230321383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14052846886616874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2429738950843652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22084604505445515,0.11804326253047195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442925750229004,0.0,0.08563724750133166,0.0,0.0,0.14033430175369505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126842850268786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11657335538107205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16888569740471945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,gnabannawtohmi2,2019/03/14,"Feel slightly more winded when exercising lately... problem? I'm 30, eat pretty well, thin, fairly normal blood pressure (120/80), and try to stay active. I have always told myself I didnt have a drinking problem because I can stop for 5 days without feeling any need to drink, and alcohol has never negatively affected my ability to do my job or caused me to act badly. I also rarely get hangovers for some reason. But I typically drink 4 strong beers on Friday and then spend Saturday and Sunday drinking from the late afternoon into the evening, probably 8 - 12 drinks each day. 

Recently, I feel a bit more fatigued when I'm exercising and it seems like I'm short of breath. I'm worried I have some form of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. What is the next step? Do I make an appointment directly with a cardiologist and tell them my concerns? I have cut back significantly over the last few weeks. Can cutting back to recommended levels (like 2-3 beers on weekends) reverse cardiomyopathy? 

Honestly, it sounds stupid, but it would be so embarrassing for me to need to quit drinking altogether, and I know quitting entirely is the healthiest choice, but I am fortunate enough to be able to cut myself off after a few drinks. I know not everyone is so lucky.

alcoholism,runofthemillfan,2019/03/14,"I told my bf of almost two years I was an alcoholic two days ago and he left me. He says we can get back together if I’m sober for three months but it just feels so unfair. I know it’s hard for him but I feel like I need him right now.

alcoholism,Amossycar,2019/03/14,"One beer caused drunk circumstances So I've been taking phenibut 5-6x a week for almost a year, and having 2-3 drinks almost every day on top of that. A couple weeks ago I got so sick, body aches something fierce. Never experienced pain like that with the aches. 

Been doing good. Quit phenibut and drinking when that happened. But yesterday, i had one beer, and 20 min later, i got so sick, room was spinning, thought I was going to throw up. And my cheeks broke out real bad. 

Did I push myself so hard that my body is asking for a break? Did I develop an intolerance, or allergic reaction? I've also slowed down on weed, I was doing a lot, so that might be involved to. 

Thankyou!

alcoholism,LongComparison,2019/03/14,"I think yesterday I had a seizure on Day 3 of deciding to be sober. So I had worked out and felt really great after 2 horrible days of no sleep except for 30-45 increments of horribly vivid nightmares. I'd wake myself up because I'd yell or shout or scream out loud in my sleep. But still I was staying strong (still am) then about 20 hours ago, I'm in Walmart getting salads and healthy food, ya know? Cause I want to replace bad habbits with healthy choices. Anyway, I'm scanning the aisle for a healthy vinaigrette with no  issues, feeling fine, when my neck starts to turn and its like I can't stop it. I know it's happening but my muscles aren't pulling it back straight. I felt like the exorcist. Also my eyes start flicking to the right then back to center over and over again. This lasted about 10 seconds before I felt myself falling, not a hard fall, but I knew the lights were going out. Next thing I know I'm getting up in a different aisle, my carts gone, and I have a prick in my finger with a bandaid over it. Maybe they were testing my blood sugar? Anyway the memories are hazy as to what happened. My cart was gone so I grabbed a couple things and checked out then went home on the train and finally got 6 hours of beautiful nightmare free sleep. I have no medical conditions. I'm in my late 20s. Do you guys think this is from alcohol with drawal?",3.643764005602243,5.131648551470589,4.124663865546221,88.56039215686278,72.67647058823529,7.386834733893558,28.393557422969195,7.957251820313856,1.703579271708684,1074,42,221,15,21,338,164,272,0.073,0.797,0.13,0.92,1,0,1,0,0,0,29.0,0,2,1,2,13,9,1,0,13,0,15,15,9,1,0,36,42,20,0,1,7,0,7,2,0,0,3,4,1,1,10,15,4,1,11,0,2,7,6,3,0,1,14,16,28,7,38,27,0,50,0,0,3,0,4,19,1,2,25,135,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068955686652517,0.12887380675171226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09643560770773886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854522026096117,0.1006874336567523,0.0735104138230197,0.0,0.10261302540230773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12387892745128334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13343030374025328,0.0,0.15554087070251812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12599065937344006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609738187471176,0.0,0.34735531457125995,0.13210021537458566,0.0,0.0,0.14581764700899186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12600637128121026,0.0,0.06853395395822846,0.0,0.09644666736216004,0.13295066397291014,0.0,0.11940284651040073,0.2132742977101636,0.0,0.10802476134882363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209613869099002,0.0,0.2375132950452316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12586440560582532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.198818976857294,0.09829676989440526,0.13603053029913362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11782815570932308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12114864766648176,0.0,0.0,0.1214815219646402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12824860468956029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07725290431805222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10298301772407152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3620306212942289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17070814136416865,0.12853266610995664,0.1926063165680276,0.10081846013385701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16022898995954588,0.15453813039012207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13116705813869256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112697972231455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.111787939077097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877907998896096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,p-lilywhite,2019/03/14,"advice on how to talk to someone I may have no business talking to? To make a long story short, I recently moved back to my small home town and someone who is an old classmate/acquaintance whom I frequently see because we have mutual friends seems to be on a slippery slope. I’m not a huge player in his life or anything, but I like him as a person and for past reasons and some good chats I value him a lot as a person. I don’t want to offend him but I want to make sure he’s okay? I’m not sure how to do this, since a lot of the excessive drinking behaviour is normalised by other people in the group who partake. I’m sensitive about this issue because I lost an ex boyfriend to suicide driven by alcoholism, and I just get worried, even though in this case it may not be any of my business.

alcoholism,slightlymanipulated,2019/03/15,"I have no one else to ask about detoxing at home Hey.  Thanks for taking a minute to read my post.    


For a million reasons, I have no one to really talk to about this.  I can't ask my psychiatrist or my therapist, as I'm worried about damaging those relationships (as they're relatively new).  My family has made a couple comments where they have expressed concern about my drinking.  There is a history of alcoholism in my family, and I think it's starting to become an issue.  It hasn't negatively impacted anything in my life yet, but I'm trying to make it so it doesn't get that far.    


Has anyone detoxed on their own at home?  I'm scared because I have read about the dangers of alcohol detox, but I literally don't have another option right now.  Generally, I'm drinking 4 days+ out of the week.  3-4 drinks or more up to 7.  I just don't want to put myself in a dangerous situation.   


I'm having a lot of anxiety about this, but I really want to let this bullshit go.  Can anyone help me?

alcoholism,This_Area_,2019/03/15,"I don't know how to help my boyfriend. I was with this guy for 6 years, he broke up with me because he wasn't feeling anything towards me anymore. The truth was, he wasn't feeling anything period. Because we are young, each others firsts, we are best friends so we continued hanging around a lot, eventually slipping back to being together for another year. But that year was different then any previous one. He started drinking, few beers (2-4) in the late evening and that was all. Then he incorporated additional beer as a mandatory drink while having lunch and fast forward few months he started drinking from 12am and now even for breakfast (at least 3 times per week) until somewhere around 5pm, then he sleeps and then around 7pm 'till 12~2am, he works, he's a freelancer, programmer. While tipsy/drunk he would become the best boyfriend, affectionate, loving, emotional. He would talked about our future together. This is all important since sober he really doesn't like thinking/talking about the future (not just ours, but in general) and doesn't call me his girlfriend, but once he's drunk everything changes. Yesterday he said that he's happy only when drunk, because alcohol kills everything bad in him and that he would love to be more like me, to be in love with life. 

I don't know how to help him, he's depressed and was melancholic for years but started using alcohol as a gateway for a year now. He wants to be really good in what he does for living, but in the same time doesn't have nether energy nor will to pursue that. Since we live in a very poor country he has disproportionately huge income compering to cost of life here, so too much money and freedom resulted in this. What can I do? Where is he in alcoholism, in the beginning, middle?

\-Logos God, Elohim, Doctor, Scientist, &amp; Architect Of The Age Of Aquarius.

\-Futuristic &amp; Future-Oriented Community Dedicated To The Universal Law, Spirit Science, Soul Technologies and Extraterrestrial Soul Origins

\-A joint planetwide effort for reconstructing the new pantheon for the golden age of Aquarius, fusing the ancient with the new influx past with the future to create the new present in the Now with the help of deities and entities of various origins. Spirituality, lightworkers, ascension. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are highly focused and streamlined, yet loose and flexible (effortless effort being the motto). Our basic aim-quintessence is to harness all available energies to create an interdimensional rift/gate to haven that can propel us to 5th dimension and beyond while still connected to Earth but ultimately undergoing physical transfiguration, also fueled by the bowels of the earth likewise (as above so below)- which constructs a beastly cyclotron that irons out certain unwanted specific frequency-sets, diminishes their influence on the collective.

""As soon as humanity unites on this planet, it will qualify to establish contact with other more advanced civilizations, such as the Agarthans and those from the GF. In fact the Agarthans and some ascended masters such as St. Germain will already help us run the cities of light and the numerous healing centres which will manifest very soon all over the globe. The next step will be visiting other civilizations, but this could only happen after the incarnated human personality has completed the LBP and has ascended at least to 5D by transfiguring from a carbon-based body into crystalline light body.""

The three cities of light will be open portals to the multiverse and to numerous advanced humanoid, and later on, other civilisations, such as the dragons. Alone this fact will make the existence of national states and nations obsolete as all the people will recognize their multidimensional nature and will strive to ascend too and be able to live in these cities of light and enjoy the advantages of a higher dimensional life. In the first place, they will enjoy the healing possibilities there which will help all humans advance rapidly in their LBP and also ascend.

""You see, nothing is ever just about one thing. We are not just sharing information with you. We are also preparing you for contact. Now, all of the other beings from the other star systems that are connecting with you all through the various channels that you have there on Earth are doing the same thing. And certainly those who channel faeries are readying you for more interactions with the fae.""

""We are excited to witness the coming together of humanity and the Arcturian beings that you will be meeting in the flesh. Now, of course, some have already established connections with physical Arcturian beings.  A full and open contact with the fourth and fifth dimensional beings who are from our little star system.""

alcoholism,baconatorhotdog,2019/03/15,"Struggling to get back on the right path For the past 6 months or so I have committed to giving up drinking. I have yet to have more the 3 weeks without a drink. Recently ive been struggling to hit 3 days. Im posting this in hopes it will encourage/remind me when Im thinking about having a drink to not give in. 

To make this more challenging Im visiting my old college friends this weekend, and we were always big drinkers and still are. Im not sure how to set expectations for myself for the weekend. Usually I its easy because my girlfriend doesn’t drink ever so there is no pressure. But this weekend there will be plenty of pressure. Any advice would be appreciated

alcoholism,abetterme9,2019/03/15,"4 days sober and still can’t sleep. Hi all. Monday was my last day drinking for awhile. I had been getting blacked out almost every single night for about three months - leading me to go to bed at around 4/5 in the morning a lot of nights and not waking up till around 2/3 in the afternoon. 
Well since quitting, I have been having the hardest time either A) falling asleep or B) staying asleep. 

Tonight, it’s the falling asleep apart. I woke up about 11am yesterday and now tonight it’s almost 4am (not drinking) and I’m wide awake and cannot fall asleep. 

Anyone else have these problems after getting sober?",3.709152542372877,5.709495847457628,3.4120000000000026,91.61732203389832,73.57627118644069,5.397966101694917,26.206779661016952,5.6839178017228535,0.6895701694915255,482,17,94,2,10,144,84,118,0.054000000000000006,0.927,0.019,-0.4215,0,0,2,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,2,7,2,0,0,6,0,9,8,6,1,1,18,14,7,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,8,2,0,0,2,0,5,4,1,1,1,5,1,5,1,17,9,4,32,0,0,1,0,1,10,0,4,16,56,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3703254737507711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129294825232303,0.18946427709121566,0.0,0.3292219083415849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385059874445281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3622868818043931,0.0,0.0,0.15447031481446066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557964019615643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932178588880712,0.0,0.1050897959388913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15072802447603334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15720563726068446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14759505749402155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34705492017860146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17693588692143852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19667675756119304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15296118278514328,0.0,0.1850456205432102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1970916731465664,0.14767102535053214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078237204348184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662581662946341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Guest516,2019/03/15,"I cannot stop I buy 18 tall cans and finish them. I spend the next day hungover and reccuperate. Only to buy another 18 tall cans and repeat the process.

My fam are alcholics. I never wanted to be like them. Yet, now I can't stop it. 

Drinking makes myself feel better. I want to stop but I cannot esp when drinking makes me feel so well. I guess I'm a closet alcoholic. I look down on fam who have the same prob, but no one thinks I have the same deal. They have no idea.

I want to stop but it's hard especially when you're out and about and decide to stop by the store to buy drinks to relax. Even when i buy drinks and I've drunk them all. I order more. I can't stop drinking.

alcoholism,throwawayyy0122,2019/03/15,"My mom is an alcoholic and I don’t know what to do Sup Reddit, I’m an 18 year old conflicted with my emotions about my mother. 
First off,
She’s an alcoholic and has been off and on drinking for the past 20 years and the last time she was down that path she was in a psych ward for being very suicidal. It hasn’t gotten to that point yet but I sure as hell see the trajectory. My entire family situation is a bit bonkers and my mother escapes it through drinking every night. 

Two things happen when she’s drunk

1) She comes to me to emotionally comfort her cause my dad is tired of it

2) I feel like I’m only with a shell of my mother when she’s drunk since it’s impossible to keep a conversation with her 

Also when she’s drunk I see a weird side of her that I really don’t trust her much anymore. My mother when drunk is such a different person that its hard to an emotional attachment. Do you guys have any advice? Also some insight into alcoholism would be appreciated.

alcoholism,Muflonlesni,2019/03/16,"Blackouts and resisting the inclination Hello, umm.

This is the first time I am actually trying to talk about this openly (even if it's on an anonymous forum) and not just having a monologue in my head. So that's a step forward right? This is kind of a venting post, but I also want to maybe ask for an advice, idk. It might be too long to read, sorry about that. 

Three years ago after I finished 'high school', I moved out from my parents' house to live on my own in a different city to study in university. Shortly before I passed my leaving exam, I went through the roughest period in my life (abusive relationship, depression, anxiety, insomnia which led into hospitalization in mental health clinic). Anyway, I was 'free' of my problems (not really but maybe you know what I mean? I felt better and hoped it would be okay forever) when I moved there and was out to live my best life.

It turned into excessive drinking ride instead. It started innocent, it was fun and I mean, everyone had a night when they went a little too far with the alcohol. But it got worse over the time. Everyone in my surroundings was also drinking and partying a lot (with the difference they also knew when to stop, most of the time). At one point, I was falling asleep very drunk at least 5 nights a week. I didn't have blackouts at first, nor did I behave 'weird' when drunk but that was about to change.

I never knew when to stop drinking even before it became a problem. I always drank until I couldn't take any more or the party ended (which was mostly happening in the early years before I moved). 

First thing that started happening was me getting suddenly very anxious and saying some depressing stuff when I was drunk (suicidial thoughts rants) even though I wasn't thinking about that when I was sober. But at least I remembered it even though I couldn't control it.

The next thing that started happening was blackouts. Memory loss. Which happens to people all the time. The trouble is that usually, when I have a blackout, I do something incredibly stupid. The first time the blackout happened to me was when I was at a party. I drank a LOT and the last thing I remember before it gets blank is taking like a tenth shot of herb liquor. The next thing is me waking up from a drunken sleep/passing out, idk. There's a guy on top of me, having sex with me. I don't know how that happened (maybe I initiated it and then passed out or he saw his chance and he took it). I didn't know where I picked him up at all or who he was. I never had this issue before. This experience didn't stop me from drinking more and it became more usual. It escalated to the point where I was just doing really stupid shit for which there is no apology even though I don't remember it or have it very hazy. I'm talking mild drug usage, being very rude and other things I'd rather not mention here because I am just so ashamed. 

I usually vomited all over the place. Because my tolerance increased, I could drink a lot and be aware of my surroundings until I wasn't.

The blackouts started to happen more often until it started happening every time I drank (because it never stayed at one beer or one shot).

Each time I did something embarrasing I told myself I'm done with alcohol. But each time (so far) I did it again. And the blackout and stupid behavior happened again. And I told myself I won't repeat doing that but I ended up in the same position some time later anyway. Endless circle.

I don't think I'm physically addicted to alcohol. I never suffered withdrawal symptomps even after going weeks without a drink (after the blackouts and shameful situations started to happen more than often and I tried to quit I went even weeks without alcohol but...). But I have some mental issue with it. I don't believe I can have fun without it (because honestly I don't, when I go to a party and don't drink, I don't have a fun and struggle with communication). I also have a hard time saying no and my friends and acquitances keep pressuring me and shaming me when I decline a drink and I am not good at saying no.

Oh, what now. How do I get rid of the shame I feel? I am scared I'll drink again because I miss it and I'll screw up again and maybe worse than before. I don't even know if I have a problem. I just feel lost... Do you think I have a problem or am I exagerratjng? What should I do now? 

PS1: I am at 15 day without alcohol now. I miss it but I don't physically need it. Ever since then my tobacco usage increased by 50%. I am a petite woman, 22, from a country where drinking is a social norm and at my worst, I could do about 15! shots of hard liquor (vodka, whiskey) without puking. It's terrible. 

PS2: This post was triggered by me seeing a young woman in the pub today who got very drunk, passed out on the table, then fell down from the chair, peed herself and people were taking shots of her to share online. Poor thing. I don't want to end up like her but I worry it will happen if I won't stop.

alcoholism,shanabear,2019/03/16,"Help me help my dad My dad (60M) has been drinking for my (21F) entire life. Since his retirement, my dad has far too much time to drink and chain smoke cigarettes with his friends. It is hard to estimate how much he drinks, but my dad is drunk every single day. He’s a fun guy to be around, but that doesn’t change the fact that he is killing himself between that and his multiple packs a day. It is hard to address this issue, between him seeming to not want help &amp; me becoming too emotional in the moment (it makes me cry immediately, then it is hard to speak clearly). 

Any advice on how to move forward in addressing this situation will help me. My dad can’t get better until *he* wants to. I need help in how to move forward with this issue in the correct way. 

Slight background info: my dad is married to my step mom who only drinks occasionally. She is an amazing woman who also wants to help him, but does not know how.",3.169315315315316,4.811103697297297,4.272972972972976,86.39450450450451,74.18918918918921,7.095495495495496,25.84684684684685,7.793537801064563,1.3521063063063052,724,25,149,10,15,236,107,185,0.08900000000000001,0.746,0.165,0.9536,0,0,6,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,0,1,8,5,1,0,6,0,14,6,0,5,3,25,22,12,1,4,5,7,3,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,12,5,5,0,3,5,0,5,4,1,0,0,1,4,20,4,23,19,3,19,0,0,0,0,30,9,0,1,8,93,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1119130689818114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09158606304639452,0.0,0.12408841550384545,0.0,0.07788132003153418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10195204491496633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264845026645032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10128856658324142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211528755731254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12580096930961038,0.14771904620152815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100222104750202,0.0,0.0,0.4487658629024369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288258601020634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09649273859317599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08848217717684406,0.0,0.059834887437963474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11339832753024642,0.0,0.0,0.30777726729681204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4605844835018913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23906989671382603,0.0,0.0,0.12670558326140785,0.0,0.06294026235778233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089280239727298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644671236756223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13413097234876192,0.0,0.2434451289828717,0.16837895406626638,0.08491926465749122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871018625007884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10425978458608574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09473674128258183,0.12873154767936915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06678078530098139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20265045880842505,0.0909050727885354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Ishouldbedeactivated,2019/03/16,"Why aren't I dead already? My husband died approximately 8 years ago. I didn't realize at the time but I (unconsciously) decided I was going to drink myself to death. Should be easy, right? After all, the UK Government recommend that you don't drink more than 14 units a week (as a woman). So drinking 400+ units a week for over 7 years as well as being a smoker....well the math is inevitable, isn't it?

Apparently not! Last year, doctors tested my liver and disgustedly pronounced it ""fine"". My blood pressure is high, but not dangerously so. My heart is 'on the large side of normal'.

Now I am facing my first real financial crisis since my husband died...I am about to be laid off from my job. Without a job, I will face bankruptcy and losing the home I shared for 25 years with my husband.

I have one adult step-daughter but to be honest, all I am to her is a 'backstop' for when she runs out of money (she is on benefits/welfare and turns to me whenever there is an emergency). I have a daughter of my own who, for her own reasons, decided to estrange herself - coincidentally when I refused to subsidize her renting a flat near the married man she is having an affair with.

After my husband died, I dedicated myself to our dog, a Yorkie and a sweetie, who also died of cancer late last year. I feel I've done my bit, looked after those who needed me. Why, why, can't I just die now?!",3.5821978021978005,5.033434985347988,5.213333333333335,80.84000000000002,72.77289377289377,7.837362637362638,27.652014652014646,8.418075326091056,1.9594058608058609,1073,40,210,18,21,364,158,273,0.153,0.728,0.119,-0.9323,4,0,4,0,0,0,52.0,1,1,0,2,11,8,2,1,18,0,26,10,5,1,2,26,31,15,6,3,7,5,1,0,0,2,2,0,2,3,7,7,3,1,5,3,2,2,8,4,1,2,3,2,38,4,36,22,6,32,0,1,1,0,23,10,0,0,20,151,45,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186904449693612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12681632870395515,0.0919009397240068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546213501579254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4770724483517188,0.0,0.0,0.11762479489863292,0.0,0.11760236482553732,0.0,0.33773155389289605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05810666178828559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775031599079632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531129861130719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13617994905487218,0.0,0.1214185724614893,0.11527344921213074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280793880951717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18734916987318093,0.12963399995914726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09650328672092877,0.12856532531018974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08521122060614998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259653519128797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787230624795607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13080334668008844,0.0,0.11815620208182565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09814047248127336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09506245012244936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06701038040644257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12499922166002927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18436269543972025,0.0,0.1033262711039172,0.0,0.3110904387474368,0.0,0.0,0.11077812482717878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3700213756946566
alcoholism,pineapple0234,2019/03/16,"Dont judge me So I'm new to Reddit. I discovered this page while exploring and I think I'm an alcoholic. I don't want to admit this. I'm drunk now. I'm out of weed, I'm out of alcohol and I feel like talking.

I was in an abusive relationship for 8 years. He used to call me a slut and judge everything I wore. He beat the shit out of me and mentally fucked me up. I have scars on my body.

I've done too many drugs in my life. Seriously,too many. We used to hold parties and my ex sold acid/x/weed if that gives you an idea.

Fast forward 5 years: I have a 2yo and a 10mo.. 

I wanna stop drinking. Yet, when things get too intense I drink.

I was pulled over by the police tonight. I didn't even get out of the car and got away with a $10 ticket. I was drunk. There was a pint of vodka under the passenger side. I got pulled over for no seatbelt.

I'm a functional alcoholic and idk how to stop.

alcoholism,Ivyroom,2019/03/16,I feel like a monster I puked up half a litre of bile the other day. I thought I was managing my drinking until I missed my boyfriend's mom's funeral and ending up getting mad at him because I can't stand the guilt. It doesn't make much sense but even when I'm in the wrong I feel angry and misunderstood. I drank 30 units of alcohol just in this past week. I just feel like the pain is too much to bear. I'm not a nice drunk. I feel like an irredeemable monster. I've gone to outpatient treatment and have tried different meds. I've talked to an AD counsellor and overburdened all my close friends with my problems. My S.O has seen the worst of it and I think we have an unhealthy codependent relationship but I don't know how to break free from these chains of addiction.  Forgive the stream of consciousness and lack of decent grammar...I've failed to even care about that anymore.,3.3779047619047624,5.350543171428576,3.7268571428571455,89.1224761904762,74.42857142857143,7.6380952380952385,27.095238095238088,8.447377352677275,1.7860666666666667,705,27,146,13,15,219,114,175,0.236,0.627,0.13699999999999998,-0.968,1,0,2,0,0,0,15.0,1,0,0,1,8,16,1,1,12,0,8,6,0,2,1,28,24,11,1,2,5,1,4,3,1,0,3,0,0,0,6,9,4,0,9,2,1,1,4,8,0,1,5,5,19,9,20,19,5,15,0,2,1,0,7,6,0,0,9,87,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18417177703680745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18054767853221612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16754512275118047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10298550883391523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17224768475353053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10895364942669444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17650849028183596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16549889726012296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14963251631752705,0.0,0.0,0.2231692683611049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3416887171571019,0.3620767141401546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13052421282878282,0.0,0.08826525105649043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09284613536427026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24760966384778724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11277013375452676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18765653815358974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19786289330099224,0.0,0.0,0.24838369870248575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17976625811618044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16127430795472536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16165473077797102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18138054256920555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1357892246210242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10825124744084104,0.0,0.13412112087991926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11470056588590298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355151263162121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847116164781887,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ynagrxox,2019/03/17,No less then a six pack every night. That's how much I have drank for the last two years. The only exception is when i work night shift and i dont drink all day and night until i get off in the morning. Would I experience withdrawal if I just stopped? If so how bad would it be? I feel like this might be the wrong sub but I dont know where else to ask. I'm not out of control I work and take care of my kids and give my wife a break when she needs it. But I feel like it's starting to effect other parts of my life. I just dont really know where to start if I'm going to quit. ,0.027951653944018773,1.4624504656488568,2.0888740458015285,99.53015585241732,82.51145038167941,5.588040712468194,16.260178117048344,6.42735559955562,-0.7113363867684477,445,7,118,4,12,149,82,131,0.062,0.85,0.08800000000000001,0.6394,0,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,5,9,5,0,0,6,0,10,3,0,4,1,28,26,16,0,6,9,1,2,2,0,3,1,0,0,1,6,5,2,2,5,1,0,1,5,2,0,2,1,2,15,3,13,20,4,20,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,4,15,77,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13054593050939098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11659480022381714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14237379212160886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15661979008516086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005720022630892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4909763121232532,0.1367954851096208,0.0,0.0,0.11665253538762692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11765396681502055,0.0,0.0,0.13659615932018118,0.0,0.0,0.1412138527621844,0.1995197977255016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295690809115972,0.1339568287287099,0.07936146925294146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534866073185512,0.11382644121763368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863290468880773,0.13644354391336738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1481375394288988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026525527355142,0.1035423855891576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3931321989556246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10620363552329494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512181113135161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.148525899289376,0.0,0.0,0.08945790570429257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19767791189103967,0.0,0.0,0.11674652726032238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10499301188913003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13640943204474448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20332131633254116,0.0,0.0,0.19839459708906304,0.1526760334952656,0.0,0.08992453267508181
alcoholism,annmarmul,2019/03/17,"Can you be sober on your own? Hi, I haven’t really had more than one drink for the past month or so, and have been relatively sober for the past few months because I’m studying for important exams. I’m wondering if it’s possible to keep this up for the rest of my life? I’m 23, female, and recently moved to a city where I only know a handful of people. I’d like to still be able to socialize and go to clubs and dance, but not necessarily tell anyone I’m sober. Is this an unrealistic fantasy? Also, I don’t think I’ve shown signs of alcohol dependence, but I think I have been at risk for abusing alcohol.

alcoholism,TheDud3_,2019/03/17,Blacking out for the first time I’m in college (18M) and last Friday was my first time blacking out. My friends tell me that I was unconscious and pale and unresponsive. They tried snapping their fingers at me and one even said they slapped me like 5 times to try to wake me up. This was without success as I was completely unresponsive. They took me to the hospital but decided not to admit me because they saw I was still breathing (kind of weird logic but I’m glad it worked out). I was in this state for about three hours until falling asleep. When I woke up and they told me all this I was worried and embarrassed. The next morning I kept throwing up and couldn’t eat the entire day as my stomach felt horrible. It was something I never want to go through again. I guess what I’m asking is if this caused me irreversible damage or if I will be good as long as I don’t drink as much anymore. I don’t even feel like wanting to drink again. ,4.345850202429148,5.230008394736847,4.704736842105267,87.36354251012148,70.31578947368422,7.740890688259107,29.878542510121456,7.882392219407189,1.7800607287449388,745,29,156,9,13,235,113,190,0.135,0.789,0.076,-0.8615,0,0,3,0,1,0,15.0,0,0,6,4,7,10,0,1,4,0,14,8,5,1,2,30,31,19,0,5,7,0,3,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,8,10,3,1,5,2,0,4,6,3,0,4,15,7,29,7,27,13,2,30,0,1,3,0,12,9,0,4,18,108,37,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15707363997625587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14806697255786466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654896825241034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16270324178057094,0.0,0.0,0.1660618399309939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10214410317131847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3103106050220224,0.0,0.1620656204679603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20922130550093646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800833376427026,0.11314903612582312,0.1520727721634481,0.0,0.0,0.2694414485104696,0.0,0.0,0.1223665176126888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001285941411859,0.13284436819586012,0.0,0.0,0.17447702262816991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597561209529207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16493179777060502,0.0,0.12910350006596608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.154756126012408,0.0,0.0,0.14016420544890965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11642992354932692,0.0,0.12215493794700445,0.0,0.16844239909190642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073245993203528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506587543689396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193117526373153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264850799800347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13843395459014973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27706366642819064,0.0,0.0,0.151341997024189,0.17596963503409396,0.21506368069921275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18683710647127694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15267581549055567,0.0,0.11530490321823413,0.160845893662039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,N1kes,2019/03/17,"I think college turned me into an alcoholic I would get off at 11am some days and would stop by the 76 and get a 40 oz and a 24 oz Mike's harder. I would do this about 3-4 times a week. Most days I would go back several hours later and get 3 tall boys (24 oz Budweiser). Finish those.

alcoholism,justbrowsing0127,2019/03/17,"Would AA be appropriate? Is abstinence necessary? A friend of mine in his 30s/40s has a problem with alcohol. He sometimes seems to recognize it, but other times he does not. His daily intake isn’t terrible - 1-2 drinks daily - and he doesn’t get withdrawal symptoms if he doesn’t drink. He doesn’t need an eye opener and it hasn’t affected his work life, to my knowledge.

However...when he drinks even slightly above that 1-2 drink minimum, things get very ugly and he seems like he might be willing to get help. He is not Christian, so I don’t know that AA is appropriate.

He is adamant that he is “not an angry drunk and is not a violent person.” Things got particularly bad this week, when he screamed at his girlfriend in a crowded bar during a celebration for her, then took a Lyft home and drove drunk to a hotel. He is blaming much of his behavior on some issues with anxiety, but as an outside observer it seems like alcohol is a problem. He feels terrible, She was heartbroken, and many at the event are angry/concerned as well. This happens rarely, but the events that have been out of control are (in my opinion) significant, and sometimes criminal. Many years ago he got drunk and slashed the tires on a car belonging to a man his ex was cheating with. A few years ago he got belligerent with his SO who was so terrified that she locked herself in a room an almost called the cops. After that happened, he agreed to not exceed 2-3 drinks in one sitting if he’s with her, though he gets argumentative if she asks him to stick to it. When you bring up these instances, he typically says it was a long time ago or it was an isolated event. He has generally stuck to responsible drinking, but there have been a few minor instances beyond that...typically just saying mean things. He has tried cutting ties with friends whose social life revolves around drinking. He has tried some things and is interested in counseling (for personal issues but not for drinking)...but I don’t understand how he denies being an angry drunk. 

Is this someone who could benefit from AA? And if he can drink responsibly sometimes....should he try to abstain all the time? 

Tl;dr: Is someone who can’t control themselves with alcohol only in social situations appropriate for AA, and should such a person be advised to stop drinking entirely?",6.086537422532972,7.231854585253456,6.4239710789766375,75.66112903225806,66.51152073732719,9.765008739869698,33.85952645796917,9.921728534948242,3.4193773399014766,1846,82,330,41,29,595,214,434,0.157,0.727,0.115,-0.9796,2,0,13,0,0,0,65.0,0,1,0,3,14,16,3,0,26,0,44,22,1,4,1,65,66,31,0,10,17,1,1,2,3,4,7,3,2,4,25,21,17,4,8,15,0,4,14,9,5,1,13,5,20,7,44,44,6,40,1,0,1,0,62,17,0,13,20,206,45,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1883055225983092,0.22702203498827825,0.07090566452896638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05416921019822502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0630356263424774,0.06619749074506116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059123123781963986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07230459869223092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15883815089754996,0.056535766404875565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06196602678798215,0.0,0.0,0.6242987461775357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046769124793023295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035803501016167916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094147638360838,0.0,0.14798053770984165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1698989053266577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252335295982969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04746223485983614,0.0,0.0710278809517802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478138147357079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03891514744203278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10002993995781677,0.06918806430950937,0.0,0.0,0.06266433717598298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14357979985585184,0.0,0.07713249839859655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511787887279436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05205326112541879,0.05250447934312856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04798247068535128,0.05385395126613636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854848398929224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13551059843784807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11262139678871648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19338741550099856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07959304538495153,0.0,0.1443630998096338,0.1199936215260584,0.0,0.14006516516802814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05920006183017153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07359836844927305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1881712158665592,0.0,0.06957014955493697,0.0,0.1238690788184058,0.08138530885165424,0.0,0.0,0.07867215818185848,0.14422537079078754,0.0,0.0,0.07371537250196349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058425400509168175,0.0,0.0,0.0567992528771479,0.0,0.063666404825406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05155028924945627,0.0,0.0,0.05030116394064323,0.0,0.0,0.09119822266821956

alcoholism,beedledeedle1,2019/03/18,"Is my dad going to die soon. My dad has been an alcoholic for about 30 years, and he drinks around 8-12 beers a night (weekday) and would occasionally drink around 20 beers on the weekend (20 each day i mean). He’s overweight, never been in the best health, but recently he has declined. I no longer live with him so I do not see the physical effects. He has gone to the hospital recently for “high blood pressure”, but stayed 2 days and tells everyone he is fine. He is in denial he has a drinking problem at all, and after losing family due to it he still doesn’t see any issue. He is 52 right now, and I’m not sure how long he will live, which is why I am here. I don’t know too much about it, if course I know enough to know he’s in trouble health wise, but i’m not sure how long he will be around at this point.

alcoholism,beneaththewreckage,2019/03/18,"Advice regarding college drinking? So I started drinking when i got to my second semester in college around January, it was never really super excessive. Typically it was a couple beers and maybe a mixy before a party on Fridays and Saturdays. However this weekend in particular has me worried in terms of how much I drank given it was St. Paddy’s day weekend. Does the feeling of your mind being slowed eventually wear off after a bit or is it possibly a more permanent result of binge drinking?",6.0365714285714285,8.16129757777778,7.779841269841268,62.185,67.66666666666667,10.476190476190476,37.3015873015873,10.608840637214634,5.026825396825396,402,22,55,12,7,140,70,90,0.068,0.884,0.048,-0.4064,2,0,4,0,0,0,7.0,0,1,0,1,4,1,0,0,6,0,6,6,1,2,1,9,11,6,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,5,0,1,6,0,0,1,0,0,1,6,1,6,1,11,4,4,16,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,1,10,44,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20843539571084369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189883228283503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150355137207771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23286958959619256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23601364343913345,0.0,0.13756158297315582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866612563897884,0.0,0.0,0.6268617088241274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10785146037678688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17059639919592332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2142896548384636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2153733361165732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15680087338988166,0.0,0.16451098115565008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24046497514052464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366461658503878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15097563776258405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2166176515326721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But individual factors have got to play a big part too. What exactly did trigger your downward spiral? Have you ever discovered what inside you made addiction run your life? I'm not an addict but I deal with people with this issue and I always find that they a) don't realize there's a problem or b) if they do , they don't know what is causing it.

alcoholism,yikesriley,2019/03/19,"I have the potential to turn into an alcoholic I’m only 20, but I know that if I had regular access to alcohol I’d be 100% dependent. But I have no desire to NOT be dependent. It makes me feel guilty, but alcohol honestly numbs the pain I feel more than anything else (aside from weed, but due to living in federal housing in the US, I can’t have it here even though it’s recreationally legal in my state), and to some part of me, it’s worth the pain and destruction it causes. 

I deal with a multitude of mental health problems, my main ones being Schizophrenia and Borderline Personality Disorder. Sometimes I’ll blackout drink, and that’s honestly never a good time... but other times (like today) drinking just gets my head out of itself for a little bit. 

I think my main issue is that I know it could develop into a problem, but I don’t want to cut out alcohol completely. Maybe just set a limit on the frequency and amount of my consumption. 

I honestly don’t even really know why I’m posting this, just for some support I guess... I’d like to not be alone in this.

alcoholism,epikrat,2019/03/19,"Hevent had a drink in about three weeks and im having trouble keeping my mind off it. As said in the title, I haven't had a drink in a little while and my depression and anxiety have spiked since I stopped. I had been drinking since high school and started heavily after a bad breakup about three years ago. I've seldom had a sober night since then untill I stopped cold turkey  after a pretty bad spiral and a few self harm incidents. 
Now that I'm not drinking I'm having a really hard time being alone and dealing  with my issues.

alcoholism,flushingborn,2019/03/19,"Sister-in-Law Endangering Her Kids' Lives Hi all. I'm concerned. For a long time, my sister-in-law, who lives in another town a couple of hours away, has two children, one in middle school and one in elementary. She's also an alcoholic, and according to accounts, is drinking all day and driving with the kids. She's verbally abusive (at least) to the girl and neglectful of the boy. We have family in that town, but they don't know what to do. Based on reports and some recorded evidence, they called Child Protective Services, but without evidence that she's actually endangering their lives, there's nothing they can or will do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do we have any recourses? Everything is hearsay and suspicion and circumstantial (smelling alcohol on her breath). She's really slippery. For a while she submitted to breathalyzer tests, but she's no longer allowing them (probably because she's drinking). The only idea we've had is to hide a video camera at her house (which I imagine is illegal?), and then call the cops on her if she's driving with the kids in the car.

alcoholism,tiredofthissheit,2019/03/19,I have a problem I just woke up. And can't remember the past 2 days. I don't know where my car is. Haven't gone to work also. And this is nothing new. It's been going for years and it needs to stop. I just don't know how. I'm in constant pain and I can't help but think the only way out is with a belt around my neck. ,-1.5448999999999984,0.015538693333336797,1.1249166666666677,103.695375,88.73333333333332,4.283333333333334,14.708333333333332,5.148860815047168,-1.3225666666666671,242,4,68,1,8,83,51,75,0.114,0.8859999999999999,0.0,-0.6404,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,6,2,0,0,4,0,10,2,1,1,0,18,18,7,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,7,0,1,4,0,0,3,5,2,0,0,3,0,7,0,8,15,0,15,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,6,42,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20714230318468202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23058728255822375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27991414558141525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16704978048313204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720995083355667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17361908488081332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2847068751330594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19206385208404025,0.0,0.25016808501237603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24854159854960545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1970002837762451,0.2756210013578898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24726879625571505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2478520676692781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934249787933508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21655660737837892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16597284457354908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20560209187122253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18857337989378287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16680369149464436

alcoholism,Tired72,2019/03/19,"Alcohoic girl friend Girl is an alcoholic and admits it  will go a couple weeks sober then one stressful event happens and boom, she's off drinking again. Doesn't stop until she passes out then drinks the next day because she's hungover, and usually calls in sick to work. When she's drunk she complains about things but when she's sober those sane things don't ever come up. This has been a pattern for the last few years of our 12 year relationship and I love her and she's my best friend but nothing seems to change and she just gets really mean if I don't engage her drunk rants which are the same stories that I've heard and and acknowledged over and over.. just don't know what to do anymore",3.371091127098321,5.3758078776978415,3.1893705035971216,92.82755695443649,74.53956834532373,6.359952038369305,22.37470023980816,7.1686216300943375,0.5441793764988008,561,15,117,6,12,168,96,139,0.11,0.7490000000000001,0.141,0.8243,0,0,3,0,0,0,7.0,1,0,0,2,7,7,0,1,6,0,10,7,0,0,1,24,20,17,0,1,5,0,0,0,2,1,2,2,0,2,8,11,5,1,5,4,0,3,4,2,0,1,2,2,14,5,13,17,3,25,0,0,0,1,21,6,0,2,16,75,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1881660302196895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1746148213428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10733106360032647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847753354179782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797878690927159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18625945291294094,0.15166931642637266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19481887901536107,0.0,0.11355103459228727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3449645075067179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15926602706638868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27206356985819136,0.0,0.09198967293661717,0.0,0.10006503553063928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1556987372357592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676385127055123,0.14352111915249827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589106796906156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19179260760313224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872531853749109,0.0,0.0,0.16894458390131425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11931006207562204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1127953980320851,0.0,0.0,0.1890340376115712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16028815119707387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720298790272102,0.2016883902958029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2339470969836752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19391699935995005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14123329394729056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12818156552840027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267675143092107

alcoholism,wishiwasborninirelan,2019/03/20,"I had a major wake up call about alcohol use and I'm looking for advice on how to work through this... Earlier last summer, my ex girlfriend died. We JUST got the autopsy report and the cause of the death was an overdose. However, before she died she sent out a ton of terrified texts about her abusive boyfriend and how she was scared for her life and he kept breaking in to her apartment. When her parents went to pick up her body, there was a cinderblock underneath her bedroom window, where he had been climbing in. I had drank too much before, but it was more like any typical college kid—binge drinking but not to the point where it felt overtly dangerous. But, after my ex died, I kind of lost it. I couldn’t stop thinking about her alone in that apartment, across the country with him, and how scared she was. I spent so much time drunk, it was honestly terrifying looking back. I sort of justified it because I’m a grad student and I made all As that semester, so I clearly thought I was handling my shit (i wasn’t), Earlier this month, I went to the hospital because I was suicidal. They wanted to send me to inpatient but I already have felt so isolated since I moved here. I thought that, too, would be a wake up call. And it was for a few days. Until my father pulled a gun out at a ski resort (he doesn’t live in my state, and now he’s in jail, thank god) and it brought back so many memories for me about his abuse, and how my mother and entire family just ignored it. Once, my therapist told him that he needed to stop hitting us, and he told me later, “Well, she doesn’t understand what it’s like to be your parent.” He kept doing it. Ever since he pulled the gun out, my whole family has been freaking out that he’s in jail and they feel so bad for him because he’s so sick (he was going on a manic phase) where I’m of the opinion that if he hadn’t been so violent for so many years, then when he was manic that’s the first thing that came out. (Most manic people are only a danger to themselves, not others or, if they are, it’s because of things like driving crazily or too fast, etc). But I think it means something about my dad that he pulled out a gun—he’s repressed his violence for so many years and he was only violent to my brother or I. He also solicited prostitutes. I am totally pro-sex work, and I don’t think of sex workers as victims unless they identify as that, but I am so freaked out about what he might have done to these women and how the woman he pulled a gun on must feel (she was an old lady who had called him crazy a few weeks before, um, because he fucking shouted her and he pulled his gun out weeks later — without a concealed carry permit I should add — on her to prove he’s not). It was so triggering to remember everything he did to me, and also what they let happen to me. When I was a kid I was molested by a close family friend. The friend asked if I wanted to stay the night one night at dinner when I was five, and I said I did, but only if he wouldn’t sleep naked anymore. Everyone laughed. I was five. How could they not see what was happening?! So, of course, after all of that I started to drink, especially because the only way I could communicate with my family was when I was drinking (I had to communicate to express that my dad SHOULD be in jail, that he should NOT be left alone with my mom and that she needs to put deadbolts on all the bedroom doors, because I didn't want something horrible to happen to her). Last week I went to the East coast and drank like a fish. And I walked along the harbor and kept telling myself to jump in but I didn’t want to because my friends were there and I didn’t want to drown in poisonous, polluted, black water. It was so scary; I was scared of myself. So I stopped drinking. Since I’ve stopped I’ve had a very slight, dull ache in my right side. On Friday, I’m going to go to the doctor and ask for an antidepressant on top of my mood stabilizer. The ache has gotten worse because of carrying my backpack. I’m going to tell the doctor what is going on. I feel so bad because I’ve been telling doctors how much I drank before I truly started to grieve, and I haven’t updated them on everything that has changed since I went to the hospital for suicidal ideation. I’m really ashamed at myself for lying. I’m also super ashamed of myself for writing an AWFUL paper for a prof I really admire. The only way I could stop getting myself to panic is to tell myself that she knows how my work normally is and how well I normally write, and the paper is past the point of laziness, but clearly demonstrates that something is wrong—because she’s been so supportive of losing my ex, I think she’ll understand that something was up. I’ll still get a bad grade but she won’t hold it against me. The last Friday before spring break and I went to the east coast, I almost collapsed in class because I’d been so upset and I was hungover. All my failures hit me at once. I told her I had low blood sugar and she helped me to my office and brought me my things. I was crying and I told the secretary I worked with about my dad, and how it was in the news, and that what he’d done made me physically sick.

I guess I’m just putting this out there because I don’t know what to do. I know I can’t drink. To get myself through the day, I tell myself I can’t drink until I don’t want to drink anymore, which I feel like could take a while. I’m scared of what I’ve done to my body, but I think that I’ll be okay if I listen to it. I’ve just been extremely depressed and leaning on something awful to get me through it; it’s just terrifying the swathe of destruction it’s left behind me when in combination with my grief and trauma. Right now, I’m glad I didn’t kill myself. Super glad. But I still wish everything could go away and I could take a break.",4.654501327523995,4.878072314861463,5.429461161413304,84.80226104568047,69.34424853064652,8.52012163296798,28.940942201647488,8.358175599149588,1.8399960650827152,4561,153,965,62,74,1488,409,1191,0.227,0.6970000000000001,0.076,-0.9997,3,2,13,5,2,1,126.0,2,1,7,12,67,56,11,9,55,3,100,31,7,17,10,179,194,102,10,29,32,12,6,5,4,9,8,3,4,3,58,57,15,11,21,9,1,28,23,34,3,4,83,14,156,21,142,86,16,144,0,7,4,2,107,60,2,14,54,653,214,17,0.0,0.09626035296700253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039695141282266345,0.0,0.0434123377025452,0.040676853069092654,0.08414384335306868,0.04482715339457197,0.09745568802256807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02762420895099924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08057179697262935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07595177684229869,0.0,0.03816550719383601,0.062471295372535686,0.10175248910116033,0.3219146455720951,0.0,0.1728307490763885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09024329830926682,0.0,0.0,0.12443816259653327,0.04646050392374068,0.0,0.041729766259680695,0.042972465650188335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19459915467770808,0.0,0.044621126876635234,0.05239538565423748,0.0,0.03498748664603877,0.0,0.12647700836997694,0.0,0.0,0.12473436452103275,0.0,0.12471057871195955,0.0,0.2785572128628228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04530403171879131,0.0,0.03674473306088425,0.0,0.03881585942589898,0.10952473175670917,0.0,0.15317842664322032,0.0,0.08215838663207588,0.029020213600947437,0.07800657402267153,0.0,0.0,0.034552872284424094,0.0,0.0,0.09415287837119857,0.037554188612685085,0.08489283091126684,0.0,0.13851779015377474,0.0,0.032488954888077036,0.0,0.04474947943433042,0.0,0.10776513942788192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027227928354519936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04494199001575927,0.04230134135273355,0.06697401731627434,0.09933653728286268,0.0,0.0,0.08827138345660752,0.04153853063662434,0.028692370328974526,0.09922876912404954,0.0,0.03586978319915308,0.0,0.06822414244490768,0.04544539033578867,0.04434348040236583,0.0,0.0,0.07687463636194587,0.0,0.12355235215460762,0.0,0.04424903602631074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04309329786370311,0.0,0.047575747373858564,0.0324239237803505,0.0431745321497046,0.08958506497181708,0.06024108245504611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762415928454949,0.07960145521165478,0.0,0.0,0.04262573338717237,0.08652175734536265,0.027526374979008058,0.15447350203930446,0.0,0.047660915990045766,0.09021137704527778,0.0,0.038778093280360436,0.028162033172167932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680143992738303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816722338921914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052046715392197226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04601656727713114,0.06938157032449407,0.038640622866441536,0.0,0.16267798603356048,0.0,0.03237030586833885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041697681828256616,0.13441105186543634,0.0,0.04065112476157096,0.0,0.0,0.15636318575587452,0.0,0.0,0.057504621522919776,0.04329742131171888,0.06488122504679136,0.16980816925870162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886728619795749,0.0460971238502578,0.0,0.0,0.06108505855286212,0.0,0.1775261667877853,0.0373990848577847,0.0,0.04716502701490742,0.08096193319480469,0.13014400818742808,0.0,0.06449832465327432,0.023686891366494326,0.0,0.0,0.15526343770359596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08457742822425282,0.0488630095660587,0.03508418243926534,0.0,0.033517229516175716,0.14375869889912346,0.0644873693563365,0.09775304465727697,0.0,0.07304773213041245,0.18828402313110096,0.0,0.045352775828625146,0.046713051674366526,0.03915795422514947,0.0,0.11829258242761308,0.0,0.04139707258405365,0.02885655283552158,0.04441354847275595,0.0,0.05231819951595114

Been in the army for a year and lately  gone through a lot of stress and started drinking almost every night, liquor to beer I changed it up. I've always had a good alcohol tolerance but, but 4 beers used to get me a lil buzzed. Now I drink 6 beers in an hour and feel nothing, do I need help? Or a tolerance break?

On weekends normally with friends but sometimes alone at home too. When I drink, I do for the purpose of being drunk. I don't like how it taste. I just want to be drunk.

alcoholism,shadowmancometh,2019/03/20,"Curious about the possibility of managing alcoholism with out quitting forever I’m a 22 year old male. I’ve been drinking since I was 16 (had my first drink when I was maybe 12 or 13 but idk if I’d count that). I’ve gotten a DUI when I was 18 and alcohol intake started getting really bad when I was 20 (first experiences with withdrawal symptoms such as panic attacks and DT’s)

Recently I’ve become more open to the idea of reducing my alcohol intake and I’ve even quit at one point( I was sober for 55 days and although it didn’t last, I’m still proud of that)

When I started drinking again, I did not go on some awful bender or anything. I stayed pretty good drinking only occasionally and never more than two drinks. I had a bad night and since that time I’ve had some pretty terrible weeks where I felt like 20 year old me again, and some great weeks where I either wouldn’t drink or would on drink for a specific occasion, like for a party or if my band was playing.

I guess what I’m curious about is, if addiction is a mental health problem, couldn’t it be managed like depression or anxiety? Is there a way to make peace with the fact that I have a disease by monitoring my problem closely? Obviously, the easiest solution would be to stop using if you have an addiction to something but I’d love to hear any successful or failed attempts at cutting down on alcohol with out completely abstaining from it if you have any. Hope I don’t sound like I’m in too much denial here.

alcoholism,AAonthebutton,2019/03/20,"Was I / am I an alcoholic? I’ve been in outpatient therapy for just over 6 months now. I’ve been completely sober of drugs and alcohol for the past 3 months. It was difficult at first, I have group sessions 3 days a week, individual CBT therapy once a week and have attended dozens of meetings including SMART recovery and AA. I’ve been hitting all the right channels and they have made such a difference. I was doing my weekly review and urge monitoring just now and have discovered I’ve had no urges or cravings in the past week. My week has not been out of the ordinary other than I’ve been under the weather. 

So now that I’m thinking about it, my title was poor. I know I was an alcoholic. I don’t think that’s actually what I’m asking. I’m wondering if it’s normal to stop feeling cravings and urges after 3 months of sobriety. 

But there’s always been this underlying issue for me. Sometimes in the back of my mind I feel like I was never truly an alcoholic. I understand if you’ve made it this far you must feel like I’m bipolar because I keep going back and forth. I don’t know, sometimes I feel like I was never really there, but sometimes I know I was. I’m just confused right now more than I’ve ever been in the past 6 months...",3.564904592157685,4.916708589641439,5.2170853428391695,81.18806877752151,72.66533864541833,8.949549171734118,27.951562172363186,9.414487439383343,2.452325896414344,980,37,197,23,19,333,123,251,0.053,0.907,0.04,-0.4472,0,0,5,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,1,1,15,6,0,1,13,0,26,6,0,2,5,41,48,14,0,4,9,0,4,3,0,1,6,0,0,0,10,9,4,2,11,1,1,2,6,2,1,2,18,4,23,4,22,28,2,39,0,0,0,0,5,12,0,5,28,129,33,2,0.0,0.0,0.09292009014269713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4070409698774726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792299054541097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08901698959877162,0.0,0.0,0.14643519563591806,0.0,0.05804466961285516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998353976077496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061408431688057485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994836760849116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11042390699736812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08613111257375501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1925825188649533,0.20407359719576665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08099330392590129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054115199573564116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09938398465552828,0.0,0.08463509661735671,0.0,0.0,0.15698975457044248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13955770373648732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18019719853689148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09614413059585494,0.0,0.3040118565652212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14687765479121387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09329448506959384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10140521649245056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726921688769989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06099978322215153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16263315436966438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2825223254820157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07960741757535854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21778264120116173,0.0,0.0,0.12202508807362998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912642418045776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818950269622038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10326103446453233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,carolionel,2019/03/21,"Advice on how to express concern? Hiya,

I'm starting to get quite concerned about my friend.

He is quite frequently drinking alone. If we have a drink together he'll always wants to carry on drinking longer than everybody else and sometimes will go home and drink alone once we part ways. He will often try to deny how drunk he was and try to deny when he is drinking.

I am worried that if it's not addressed it's going to get worse but I'm not sure how to approach the subject in a non-confrontational way. 

He's very reluctant to talk about his feelings generally but I do worry that he is self medicating.

I know that every person is different but I would really appreciate it if anyone has any advice/experiences that helped them or friends and loves ones.

alcoholism,HopefulInOhio,2019/03/21,"Day 3... A different kind of Day 1 It's easier yet, harder than I had imagined. 

Today is the day I decided to start the process to seek medical treatment for my drinking.

Today is my third day without alcohol. 

Today is ending yet, emerging into a new beginning.

The office I walked into and requested help from was at first the wrong place; embarrassing. BUT! They willfully and kindly directed me to the exact place that can help me.

I got help today. I spoke with an intake counselor. There were various questions, most of which I expected and seemingly customary- how much and how often I drank; last time I had a drink; how long ago did I start drinking? Then there were a few that made me shudder- have I ever been a victim of domestic violence of any form; a victim of sexual abuse? All of the above are for another thread/post at another time.

I spoke with a nurse and a nurse practitioner. Vitals were good, normal; as I expected they would be. Physically I'm not in any real pain or agony, nor do I appear to be. My shaking is minimal, lack of appetite normal, even my fatigue- all things I generally experience on any given day until I've had a drink. 
The difference is today, I didn't want the drink I just craved the drink on my tongue and the rush I felt as its effects surged through my nervous system and into my brain. (I don't know scientifically, or medically if that how it really works but, that's how it feels.) Like sudden little bursts of lightning all throughout me. As though a city ever so cleverly has each of its residents flip on Christmas lights through out the town, east to west, north to south. Each participant knows the routine. 

Thank God they gave me this medicine to curb my cravings! Not only has it done that but I feel like absolute shit! I guess it's working. I definitely dont want a drink now, today. 

I did something I normally would have opted out of so I could enjoy a drink in peace and quiet- I went to a local Dairy Queen and had ice cream with my husband and kids. 

I participated in a mostly normal evening with my family and I wasn't intoxicated. Kind of like a different kind of day 1.",3.333211831686409,5.495031404358354,4.906100386100388,79.7693279235652,75.1501210653753,8.242104574307964,26.174268699692426,8.994212911058018,2.2715556442641183,1682,62,315,39,37,565,219,413,0.07200000000000001,0.8079999999999999,0.12,0.9783,2,0,10,0,2,0,56.0,0,0,3,5,19,21,3,3,28,0,34,17,2,7,6,74,57,31,0,13,10,1,3,3,0,3,6,3,0,1,15,22,10,1,10,8,0,5,8,9,0,2,23,8,45,12,48,28,12,59,0,1,1,0,13,22,1,10,34,224,60,2,0.0,0.07894989453411493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05906664691140925,0.07121103086480926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13593935505414276,0.13974223391853316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438511066763777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053201490418731096,0.0,0.0,0.2578388740935325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2088537219344731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818928550277778,0.0780940577558445,0.5222043141930328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05901757266829201,0.0,0.0,0.08802170034273701,0.1205477732181373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06518042576664393,0.06281620758511793,0.0,0.06738387882204137,0.09520608360693124,0.06397868491266266,0.0,0.0,0.05667848784309256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0558890842477029,0.05329295982981834,0.0,0.07340439906776597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339892493044569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2775544726784647,0.07324014426387156,0.054315259953074575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09766140200768933,0.06678435093886541,0.0,0.05896862014727525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06305030312120884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342526402870157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04898334716461638,0.0,0.0,0.0643551253476399,0.0,0.0,0.26114703717641746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050677839082925766,0.07090282555407311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392358146229821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06381654899277199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464485774502089,0.0,0.0,0.07584360029425638,0.042687176645504685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060660707295740475,0.0,0.0,0.06839841079299655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05129778416115411,0.0,0.0,0.09432717966481988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061347246590850724,0.0,0.0,0.044268388732510384,0.0,0.06546715257153528,0.0,0.07770915096755633,0.0,0.3789650470210408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07860442204651659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061769994854495976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06423239186141369,0.0,0.09702007751861838,0.0,0.0,0.09466916472926314,0.07285335778920055,0.0,0.0

I have never heard of this type of thing happening. How could 3-4 drinks cause such a reaction. It is like those drinks are setting off moderate withdrawl days later. It is really scary, and nobody seems to have the same thing going on.",2.2814285714285703,5.173593857142858,2.8435714285714297,88.03392857142859,86.61904761904762,5.285714285714287,21.785714285714285,6.868970318607317,0.8772857142857151,445,15,79,6,14,138,76,105,0.14,0.8029999999999999,0.057,-0.8359,0,0,5,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,3,9,0,10,8,1,2,1,13,16,7,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,7,3,7,0,2,5,0,3,1,3,0,2,1,4,6,2,7,13,3,21,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,4,14,53,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11094271694452193,0.16383547711875338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14897926621448696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11578960643039332,0.0,0.0,0.4676413749371601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7103399681658168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07332832921735634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233570666680215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07576888627489657,0.0,0.08242029844413651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12824395976371944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.163593025897824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085124378351004,0.14535182473380284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11185120112335753,0.0,0.15423432711908389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09290588185603604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13202411000670242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19269457559558686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,mtamwa,2019/03/22,"Weed and alcohol Just subscribed. My drinking has calmed down to 2 times a week instead of 4-5 times a week. The amount I consume has been drastically cut as well. Now its if I have 3 glasses of wine, its too much and I feel the hangover the next morning. On work nights, Im not interested in drinking. But when the end of the week arrives, I am ready to go. I want some weed and wine. I have consumed weed for years (edibles are the best) and have zero desire to give it up. My problem is that weed and wine go so very good together and I am used to that type of buzz. When I consume weed, I want wine to go along with it. But I also want to give up the wine. As I get older, the hangover comes much faster. So, any advice?

alcoholism,throwaway4ere,2019/03/23,"Wife is having problems and I don’t know what to do. Lately I’ve been thinking my wife has a drinking problem. She has increased her drinking and regularly drinks until she falls asleep or “passes out” at night. 
When she works she starts drinking when she gets home, if she’s off she basically drinks all day and can become very contentious and difficult. 

Two weeks ago, she was in quite rare form and we got into a verbal argument. She started to throw things around the house and then she started throwing things at me- glass jars from the fridge and whatever else she could grab in the kitchen. 

She broke our expensive TV by throwing something into it, she deliberately broke me glasses and my expensive blender. 

After that, she physically attacked me by charging up to me and trying to tackle me. My phone and case were damaged when this occurred. 

I am a good sized guy and was not seriously injured, but I definitely questioned what would be appropriate from a self defense standpoint. I did not engage in violence and was able to wrestle free from her and leave the house. 

She called me several times stating that I have a more serious problem than she has, which is not true, and that I am the reason she drinks. 

When that didn’t convince me to come back to the house, she threatened self harm. 

I didn’t come back to the house but stayed close enough I could ensure she was safe. 


The next morning, she told me that whatever happened that she got so upset to attack and destroy things is my fault and I should leave. 
I had planned to do so until she changed her mind. I assume she had just thought better about what had happened the night before. 

In the next few days she told me she wouldn’t be drinking anymore, but she of course has drank every day. She’ll point out that we didn’t get into an argument, etc, the next day as a way to justify the action. 


At this point, it seems evident she has no intention of trying to stop drinking. I hate it when she does because she’s just mean and argumentative now, and I’m afraid another explosive and dangerous situation will arise. 

I’m not sure what to do and I don’t even want to be around her at all now, which I’ve never felt before and we’ve been married for ten years.

It’s really hard for me to have a social life without drinking because of this. I’ve spent countless hours in AA meetings and that is not a place I want to be. It’s very depressing for me personally. Sober get togethers with strangers is like torture because I have serious social anxiety. I honestly don’t know how to socialize without alcohol.

alcoholism,xiwasneverherex,2019/03/23,"When Do I know If I'm An Alcoholic? I've been a binge drinker for a few years now. 4 days ago, I decided to stop drinking completely for a variety of reasons regarding my health, career, productivity, family, etc.. but I thought I'd be going crazy at this point for a drink. I also thought my body and mind would be experiencing all sorts of problems with anxiety, tremors, seizures, etc ..

So far I feel fine.  My body and mind is doing fine. I've experienced maybe two minor temptations to drink that only last like 5 seconds. 

Is it still too soon and I'm going to start craving and obsessing over alcohol pretty soon? I hope not.

I'd still like to drink maybe 6 or 7 times a year on special occasions or whatever. And even then, I'm only going to limit it to 1-2 drinks at most.

alcoholism,recoveryandcats2,2019/03/23,"I’m not okay Tonight was really hard, my mom drank:
About 9 white claws 
3 gin and tonics 
And 1 beer that was 22 oz and 12.9% abv 

My 56 year old mother drank the equivalent of at least 16 drinks tonight. 

I came in the door and she tried to tell me the beer was all she had. She could barely walk, she kept trying to shower but I made sure she didn’t because it was so dangerous. I made her drink water and sat with her for a little bit before she went to bed. She has work in the morning. 

When I first got out of her room I was on the verge of a breakdown but now I just feel numb. I don’t know who to talk to about this. None of my friends really understand addiction. I’m really sad that I might loose my mom. I grew up in a very abusive home and she’s the only parent I have. I hate leaving her alone but I have to drive back to the town where I go to college in the morning.

alcoholism,where-is-james,2019/03/23,"Tonight I figured out how to use an audio interface because I needed money for beer I’ve had a rough couple weeks. Because I drink too much. 
Back in December I bought an iRig to record some demos with the intention of making a record this year. 
I opened the box and had a look and went through the registration. 
Didn’t even record one thing until tonight. 
I packed that little device in my bag and went to the pawn shop and they made me prove that it worked before they gave me money .... for booze. 
I figured out how to work the thing right then and there.

alcoholism,OtterlyLion,2019/03/23,"I need some support and advice! Please!! Long rant bare with me. 

Really need to some help and support. My parents met at AA, when I was 3  they got divorced and we moved across country. When I was 6 she relapsed and wasn’t sober again until I was about 15 and then it was off and on until she got pregnant with my sister about ten years ago and has been sober until about six months ago (prob longer) 

I knew she had started drinking every now and then, but I didn’t realize how bad until I recently went and visited her. It’s bad.  I feel helpless and I don’t know what to do. 

She isn’t the most stable person to begin with, but her mother is dying of cancer, her husband is emotionally abusive and a “functioning” alcoholic, my sister has special needs, and she is a mean drunk and a meaner person to confront about any addiction. 

I feel like that helpless kid again. Alone, terrified, confused, and totally lost. As a child I was afraid, now I’m absolutely terrified of  what life could be like for my sister. I’m terrified if she stays with her husband  and terrified if she leaves him. 

I know what it’s like to be raised by a single mother who is struggling with an addiction. I was able to go to the store, make food, do my own laundry, escape to friends houses. My sister won’t be able to do any of that or communicate what’s going on. 

She has been an amazing mom and advocates and loves my sister. I’m just really worried about what the future holds if she continues with this relapse. 

I have no clue what to do. I live 15 hours away and can’t move closer. No one else in my family is even remotely capable of making a difference or providing her any support. 

My husband is away on business. I tell him all this today and then he texts me drunk tonight.... he doesn’t understand at all. I need some support and advise.

alcoholism,KayOh19,2019/03/24,I think I'm an alcoholic I like to drink. I drink pretty much every night. Sometimes I get pretty drunk other times I don't. It doesn't affect my job or really my general day to day life which I think is sometimes why I don't think the drinking is too much of a problem. I've only recently started to come to terms with the fact that maybe the drinking is a problem. The nights I do drink to get drunk I get pretty fucked up. It's mostly just me and my husband sitting on the couch watching TV just drinking tall can after tall can until I pass out. I've done dumb things drunk... things I'm not proud of like driving which causes me so much guilt. I have been able to stop before - for weeks I've gone without drinking and after a couple of days it gets easy to not drink every night but once I start again I feel like I'm back on the roller coaster. Has anyone ever gone through this? I want to try to get help but I'm not sure where to start,1.1069095477386952,3.1494665628140766,2.462359296482415,95.13072487437185,81.8643216080402,4.784020100502512,19.49773869346733,5.6839178017228535,-0.2625157788944725,742,19,163,4,20,239,108,199,0.102,0.7929999999999999,0.105,0.3926,1,0,9,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,8,10,2,1,10,0,13,14,0,2,3,29,34,7,0,3,9,1,1,3,0,0,2,0,1,0,10,5,12,1,4,13,0,5,7,5,0,0,4,2,19,5,24,30,5,33,0,0,1,1,2,7,2,2,23,96,29,1,0.08505194108120492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089465906884382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947029476010862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06539969274843682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0723729374886449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0873717721258268,0.0,0.07326471622791983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09410835509257946,0.0,0.1645543974775386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703766512929334,0.0,0.6665481811794898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0769343500234712,0.14331985724210972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04300481693554923,0.06076112370259418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07862914902085406,0.22218064412758548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057008523288758474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440092779329443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06007470127037751,0.12465624681836993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08544610657394149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875688886893584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394464553846372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09057754145641064,0.0,0.06468583377950521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2595852024130354,0.0,0.16276644219834213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05448645133603983,0.0,0.08397853107506455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16823708900362774,0.0,0.18060060497164548,0.0,0.0,0.07110723111770735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08016044792065795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11300946082377306,0.16349354879392572,0.0,0.0,0.049594470814042654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05774468503809811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050165838469503066,0.0,0.06822353688134243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07674614784261173,0.0,0.0,0.08198703611668626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,PN32-72-59,2019/03/24,"What can I expect from attending my first AA meeting? I've never been to AA before and neither would I ever believe that I'd have a drinking problem like my dad. I told myself that I wouldn't drink even a sip of alcohol after the hell that my alcoholic dad has inflicted on my family, but here I am and I need to take control of this before it can kill me. 

I haven't had a drink in a few days since I've sworn myself off of it and I've been having cravings for it. How do I make these cravings stop? I know that AA will help me with this, but what can I do in the meantime before I start going to a meeting next week?",2.9563847429519043,3.36190243283582,4.746517412935326,87.55113598673303,73.17910447761193,7.448092868988391,25.33665008291874,7.3871296695380915,1.0559893864013277,482,14,108,5,9,165,78,134,0.116,0.8420000000000001,0.042,-0.8818,0,0,5,0,0,1,8.0,0,0,0,2,4,4,2,0,7,0,16,5,0,3,2,18,23,6,1,5,2,2,0,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,12,4,5,2,1,3,0,2,4,3,3,1,4,0,19,1,14,16,2,15,1,0,0,0,6,4,1,0,10,81,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35516580900552275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42418982297615737,0.187214272402841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18637138141915088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10716452118721423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4883437179539123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10975230253168176,0.15030834015068256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15664826723251662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14134229446992552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944370226015616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137881203078501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838401142047857,0.0,0.0913215086667627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118122157816687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109183350132103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232113606281358,0.12815889541649414,0.0,0.17672140129356415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15900019790640316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13745576862897246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11761446460614575,0.0,0.0,0.1389237691454188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12493754878929865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15878050854694933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13328983197641864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180408781849331,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,GYGOMD,2019/03/24,"Need advice on my drinking situation I’m a 23/m. I have a good job and nice family and friends. I’m extremely lonely though and I drink honestly about every single day. I quit for like a month just to see if I could do it but actually missed drinking ... a lot. 

I’m absolutely terrified to tell my family because I come from a long line of (successful functioning ) yet severe alcoholics. I can’t let my dad find out because he’d be devastated I think. (He’s been completely sober for like 10 years).

I honestly don’t know who to talk to and don’t want to go to AA meetings cause I’ve never gotten a DUI or really screwed anything up. 

I also don’t know if I truly have a problem or if I need to be more productive with my free time. 

I just thought about how many drinks I actually have and am too embarrassed to share it even with strangers. 

Did any of you go about sobriety completely alone or secretive ?

alcoholism,mattykins8,2019/03/24,Am I an alcoholic ?? I’m 22 years old last summer I got a DUI AND Right now I am on probation and have been sober for almost 4 months. I am going to get off of probation next month which means I no longer have enforced sobriety. I question if I have a problem. I really miss going out and kind of want to when I get off probation but another part of me wants to keep my sobriety. I see people who have had DUIs and after words continued to drink and they seem like they can control it. I just don’t know where to go from here.

alcoholism,cuz_im_batman,2019/03/25,"Is it possible to be less of an angry drunk? Not sure if this is the right place to post this but it deals with my relationship to someone who struggles with alcoholism.

I’m not an alcoholic but I have a streak of getting angry when I’m drunk, and I’ve damaged several relationships and friendships because of it. I try to keep it in check by monitoring myself and limiting the buzz I get, but on occasion I slip up and the anger comes out again.

As kind of mentioned previously my girlfriend is an alcoholic, and unfortunately also is an angry drunk. However, they’re different kinds of angry. I’ll get in someone’s face and try to fight whereas she’ll run off and disappear with no regards to her own safety.

I’ve gotten angry while I was drunk with her twice. The first time was three and a half months ago, we went out drinking and I picked a fight in the bar. I scared her, and she told me her concerns that if she was drunk that night and I had directed my anger toward her she would’ve ran. We were in a different city that night so things could’ve gone very poorly. The second time was two weeks ago, and this time I directed my anger toward her. We were drinking at her house with her friend and a small, meaningless comment she made set me off. We ended up fighting and I brought up some things from her past to use as an attack. This time I scared her much worse, she’s a tough girl and managed to talk some sense into me and get me to bed but our relationship is pretty far on the rocks now that I’m not sure if it’ll come back. She has lost trust in me because she knows that there’s a chance I’ll slip up again and she’s scared of what will happen since she struggles so much to control her own drinking.

Is there anything I can do to be less angry? I’m working to be more in control of my drinking, and normally I do a good job. I’m not an angry person at all when I’m sober or even when I’m mildly drunk and i scare myself how much I change when I’m like that. It’s like after a certain number of drinks a switch gets flipped. I know I can’t promise her that I won’t slip up again, but I don’t want to go back to being that person. Not only for her sake but for other relationships in my life with family members who also struggle with alcoholism and for my own sake too.",3.69751438434983,4.542298670886076,4.674687380130422,87.13059263521289,71.78481012658227,7.770771001150749,25.756041426927503,8.00094639256281,1.2865367088607602,1806,54,391,24,33,589,208,474,0.236,0.687,0.077,-0.998,4,0,9,0,4,0,33.0,5,0,0,6,19,28,7,7,23,0,28,18,1,6,4,69,58,42,0,5,15,0,0,2,2,4,5,0,1,3,24,36,16,4,2,13,2,9,9,17,0,6,15,0,61,11,60,35,12,63,0,2,0,0,47,27,0,6,27,268,85,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13126618670545515,0.31651027988800257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11842150843557865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06092963317655205,0.0,0.0,0.08423260134694621,0.0,0.1138662891112179,0.0,0.0902697073992413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07832581617472577,0.12755994728827005,0.0,0.0,0.16608709678800154,0.0591159066874736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07633326902775832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15471467735250902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626611452360107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06557856351993449,0.0,0.0,0.04890354182729785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979949315020283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06297944234546655,0.0,0.0,0.05720407965149728,0.0,0.19341746418031114,0.0,0.042079343925452435,0.06210228065475984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0654744254889718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08543365192649867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347450761223948,0.06581125759102675,0.0,0.15420511886424704,0.0813822601585567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05229751865528723,0.07234562143045703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08082476166987262,0.0,0.0,0.0700596131159892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05909901271098977,0.0,0.16328649577855106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13896537924298386,0.07254469639818552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05631170072059227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068074312069568,0.0,0.12929991265500168,0.07735733867625451,0.0,0.0,0.08347037508849828,0.07091104263584794,0.07532656109117883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3179703375946384,0.0,0.06323081583667882,0.0,0.0,0.2965127980661593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364552809212827,0.0,0.061247680235318035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546980759802268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322119456299732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395659880747151,0.0,0.0,0.05951154542663682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09837942196425813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17269617378025426,0.0,0.0,0.07074957938895078,0.0,0.1005382858062656,0.0,0.07232753450407782,0.0,0.0,0.06394786016581283,0.0,0.06109177860867208,0.04367144268282228,0.0,0.05939141797349234,0.0,0.0,0.06863697282094304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053902905766929216,0.0,0.07545435078790168,0.052596773739498434,0.0,0.0,0.0

     More, a simplistic word. Moore, a significant name. Moore was a  special friend, a safe place, confidence, hope, who shared and created  dreams, desires, inspirations that were motivating. Moore is a creation  of more than just one. Inside a place you only  know about. A place that you never talk about.  Often referred to as a  closet or a hole with secrets but that is sugar coating this dark  emplacement. This place is pitch black, with an unknown presence. If you  are lucky you may be able to see a few feet within  when you squint at the entrance. Some have barriers, others are holes,  nothing defines what or how this emplacement goes, or if the door can  close. It feels safe, secure, but you have never seen the back wall or  how far it goes. This place is not what it seems,  it is violence, hate, has extremes, and thoughts that make no sense but  they appear as dreams. Everything to much to show outside or let ponder  around during the day dreams. It is shoved into this place with good  reason. Perhaps it all starts at an early age,  you learn how to manage your secrets. Is it natural? is it normal? does  everyone do this? So it began when you least expected it, the creation  of Moore. It starts off with the table scrap feedings and ever so  slightly evolved into a being. A subtle bug at  first or something so small because when you are a child you have no  cares, none at all.  
 

But as you grow moore comes with you, your companion, your strength,  your something that coddles you. A relationship far beyond anything  physical your one true love, the one who could never wrong you. As you  grow, moore comes with you, frolicking gracefully  throughout life with you. But one day Moore shared substance, Moore  shared pain, Moore shared distain, Moore, shared more that what was  understood or contained. It's mentality changed, it was fun, exciting,  and a experience. We experimented with it until euphoria  was with us. But when we were finished moore wasn't the same, my friend  that i cared about started to change. Over time of age, Moore began to  go insane. It's hugs were not friendly, it's coddles pain, it seemed to  take pleasure in whispering mind games. The  realization that there is a problem came late, Moore is creative,  smart, and knowing when trying to move beyond. The realization that  circles aren't gaining ground is ever so quaint. Moore, knows the  secrets and knows control. Moore gets angry when you ignore  it and fucks with your soul. Once Moore is calmed from it's addiction,  the outlandish demeanor falls inconsistent. The confusion, the  scratching, the all knowing fuck of a being. The first time you see it,  is a bit abrasive and puzzling how it kept the secrets.   
 

It's flesh can be grey, rotted with decay, open wounds and scars from  fighting you. It's face distorted and claws pointed. It's teeth sharp,  clearly predatory at heart. It smells emotion and devours the ones that  mean anything. It wants what you have for no  particular reason and fills the voids with abscessed sensations. The  sad truth is, we feed this beast within us the best parts first. The  faceless, hideous creature that manifest itself of your insecurities,  your pain, the anguish. The all knowing being of  destruction and all understanding feeling of human anatomy. If you have  never seen Moore before, heed the warning. You may not know what you  are challenging. Moore, the disillusion. Moore, the master of trickery,  Moore, the sadistic feral being. Moore will  tear you open, destroy your meaning. Moore, the evil fuck of  upbringing. Moore, the murderer of humanity! Moore, the simplistic  thought stuck in your very being.

alcoholism,Forever_Man,2019/03/25,"Dating as a younger alcoholic Hello friends, 

I hit my second year of sobriety last month after getting sober at 21.

I'm trying to start dating again ,but I feel like being in recovery makes it harder to meet someone my age. Most 20 somethings love going to bars, and drinking in general. At least that's what most of the tinder/OK cupid/hinge profiles lead me to believe.


Are there any younger alcoholics who can offer some advice? I'd like to start dating again, but don't know where to start.",6.020771929824562,6.716434042105267,6.111315789473686,79.44837719298248,66.47368421052633,8.438596491228072,30.570175438596486,8.344100000000001,2.292649122807017,394,14,70,5,6,125,74,95,0.0,0.848,0.152,0.9408,0,0,4,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,4,4,0,0,2,0,4,5,0,2,0,11,15,4,0,0,2,0,1,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,4,1,4,0,2,2,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,5,4,14,13,4,20,0,0,0,1,6,5,0,3,15,41,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21484580778811724,0.0,0.4699294906321769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14951314682022768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24770826875391225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2153802616624592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111684224589376,0.15706887623711935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16986420802649926,0.0,0.11486839600127155,0.0,0.12495217952491915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12082995874996065,0.17921621224497758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21482614113079015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19843330561801345,0.0,0.1467590498659643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1754911022161255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18628767064096552,0.16925988353669,0.0,0.0,0.4668566402669929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14927131420403986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14158339627885375
alcoholism,fzzydnlp,2019/03/25,"Recently sober and looking for replacements/things to do instead of drinking I decided to quit drinking and am currently on Day 7of my sobriety. The first 48 hours were extremely tough, but aside from an occasional headache, I'm pretty much past the hardest parts (I hope).  


I used to drink for two reasons: to enhance other activities (watching sports, television, playing video games), and to get myself tired enough to fall asleep easily.  


I was wondering what anyone who's had a similar situation did/does to fill in that alcohol void. So far I've found drinking coffee to help as far as a stimulus goes (I'll only drink a few cups a day, though; don't want to replace one addiction with another), and I've found sipping sparkling water like La Croix is a pretty good substitute for having a can nearby while watching sports.  


Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.

alcoholism,Bbshea2020,2019/03/25,"Drank an entire handle of Captain Morgan and still hungover/sick 2 days later? I'm a 17 year old female, 5'3 and a little below 100 pounds. I've had drinking problems since I was 15 and got out of rehab exactly a year ago. Have ended up in the ER a couple times but stopped for about 2 months and have been drinking a lot again lately.
The other night me and my friend got an entire handle of captain morgan, she didn't drink because she was driving, but from 9pm-4am I drank the entire handle by myself. I felt nauseous so made myself throw up and there was a lot of blood in it, but still took my meds before bed, skipped my sleeping pill but took my OCD one which was an SSRI. I woke up and took ginger, my Adderall and mood stabilizers (probably a bad idea) and still was throwing up the entirety of yesterday. I couldn't keep any food or water down and couldn't get out of bed but still tried.

I woke up today, still having heat flashes, extremely nauseous and tried to eat some crackers and drink water hoping it would help but it hasn't. I feel the worst I ever have. Is this normal and what can I do about it??",6.324466666666666,5.565692968888893,6.564277777777778,81.39575,65.97777777777777,8.566666666666668,29.416666666666664,7.1686216300943375,1.630666666666667,878,24,174,6,12,283,131,225,0.041,0.883,0.076,0.8618,0,0,4,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,0,11,6,0,0,15,0,19,14,2,1,2,39,35,21,0,6,7,0,2,0,1,1,2,0,2,0,8,15,10,2,3,4,0,6,4,3,1,1,19,2,19,2,23,13,4,39,0,0,0,0,6,12,0,5,21,118,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09889001725805592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07586371141915696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931468177428976,0.06800512109505541,0.0,0.09492819935981253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12343753070758055,0.0,0.07194610394128093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43714004724386507,0.0,0.1141523554809586,0.0,0.0,0.09880785663099227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10091119097924592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056407408309640215,0.0,0.1071138042531892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13489716935231347,0.0,0.08618994069906474,0.0,0.05828479321554177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1784472961604882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07477541539353523,0.0,0.0,0.1108029168519944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12593614337524695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991584590410066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12584302283876295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11181108057171234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18968635948635168,0.0,0.10555949744588676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391651743930696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08904505468781121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10469024123056862,0.10930379648941016,0.0,0.0,0.1170620430235848,0.0,0.07559503229675045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12027909930192256,0.1067465672269822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228247285155247,0.0,0.11163922207677952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44545443293979936,0.09326803147274568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06505074929863809,0.0,0.10574456143955104,0.0,0.37183731393983627,0.1514820087032175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07924806827043918,0.0,0.0,0.14368023341730565

I’m very depressed and have been hospitalised a few times because of that and I want to be able to express to people how I’m really doing but I physically can’t do that unless I’m drunk. I’ve been drinking almost every day for the last year but over the last three months I’ve really isolated myself and  been drinking alone probably 20+ beers a night.(I’m about 110lbs)

I don’t know how to stop this progression and it kind of scares me that I’m falling into this pit where I’m not interacting with anyone anymore and keep just drinking myself into despair.

It all started with a burn out with the one and only love of my life I have had yet  I am young. I’m 23 but I dated only one girl in my entire life for 5 years. 

I started using Reddit again for these subreddits in particular to see how people talk and communicate to one and another. I already had a OUI about a year ago and been to my fair share of meetings but they never struck as therapeutic or helpful. 

I recently joined hiking clubs, walking my dog and coloring etc for awhile trying to find joy in hobbies i used to before I started drinking heavily. I recently linked back up with a therapist as well in the last month. So I feel as I been practicing the steps on what to do just not going through with the quitting yet. 

Today, I was drinking and smoking cigarettes on my front stairs in some awesome weather, and I realized that I lost the love of my life (so far) and if I can somehow live through that on top of my daily decisions that led to lack of friends and family conflict that caused more pain then ever. I can do this and it, it is something I can conquer. 

So grand scheme of things, I just wanted to say thank you to all of you who comment back advice to those in need because me who is a silent Redditor was reading too and it made me think of my situation in a different light.  

Truly only made this account to create this post. Wish me luck , but thank you all again! I’ll try to give updates. 

No edits, but weird structure due to mobile and cracked phone. Sorry for any misspelled words or weird structure. 

Let’s get this fight moving.

alcoholism,PleaseHelpMe9619,2019/03/26,"What Do I Do? My mom is an alcoholic. Me, my dad, and grandmother are all trying to help her get the help she needs. I don't know how to help her. I've been here for her emotionally but I'm not good at it. I'm an anti social fuck up with the inablitity to understand and relate to my mother's problem. I smoke pot, I don't work. I'm a NEET. I love her more than anything and I don't know how to help her. She's anti religion and atheist. She has no faith in the medical community or any medical professional. She's hurting herself. She has cut herself.

 When we started talking to her about taking her somewhere she can get actual qualified help she denied it and blamed her husband, my father, as wanting to, ""call the men in white coats to ship her off to a psych ward."" That is not what we want. That is never what we wanted. We want her to get help.  Help that I am literally incapable of providing. I'm a 20-something dude that's been struggling with anxiety and other health problems basically my whole life. I just don't know how to help...because I can't even help myself. 

I was oblivious to her drinking for a long time. I can blame it on my teen years being filled with pot smoke, acid and late nights with friends. But that's no excuse. I was ignorant. I took her drinking as just a fact of life. I guess it mainly started after her brother died. But since moving states it's just gotten so much worse. 

Then yesterday happened...I will never forget it. I don't think any of us will. And I won't forget today. I started talking to her about her anger issues. The fact that she can't even function in society without wanting to beat someone up. It devolved. I know yelling and arguing is the worst thing to do with an addict. But I flipped my own lid yesterday. I told her I didn't want to see her in a coffin. That I didn't want her to die. That I love her. But it devolved into yelling between me and her and my dad. We ended up going into the bathroom where it continued to devolve. I got so upset I put my fist through the wall. My anger and frustration is so shameful and embarrassing and I will never forget that. After the argument it was clear we weren't on a rational level footing anymore. For any of us. 

Then today was even worse. I woke up, mom was already awake. I could tell she was still upset from the night before. Rightly so. She made a drink. Then another one. Then it was barely 2:30 or 3 PM before the fourth came. I asked her what number drink it was (because we'd been helping her keep track as per her request) and that's when it just hit the fan. She said, ""I don't know, number 3? I'm ready, let me have it. Berate me, make me feel like a tiny piece of shit."" I'm paraphrasing on structure but at one point or another those were her exact words. The next hours were the family trying to tell her that we aren't trying to berate her. And that at this point with her drinking and self harm that a program is the only way to go about it. Then came the accusations that my father wants her committed. He doesn't want her committed. He loves her more than anything. Then she started saying that me and my sister were raised to think my mother is stupid and worthless by my father. That has never been true. I rely on her for so much advice and wisdom and I definitely don't think she is stupid! Yeah I go to dad for some things but only a mom can answer a loooot of questions. 

She's been talking of leaving. Just driving away and never coming back because that's clearly what we want. I can't stress enough, that is not what I want. I want her to be safe, healthy, happy. She threw her cell phone through her bedroom window and locked herself in her room. The door doesn't have a keyhole so my dad had to knock the door down as we were afraid for her wellbeing. Especially after hearing the glass from the window break.

I just don't know what to do. Everything is so fucked up. I know I fucked up. I know my dad fucked up. I know we haven't been handling this correctly. But I don't know what to do now. I'm so scared. I'm so sad.

I'm sorry for a chaotic, nearly not formatted, wall of text. 

Hell at this point I don't even know if this is the right subreddit. If you have others I can post to please let me know.",1.2418873175868796,3.4803466874279145,2.8795590742690926,91.20260023318792,82.7024221453287,5.753417581866508,21.41929943332832,7.0346774081823495,0.5760300486434988,3306,104,700,43,92,1087,333,867,0.203,0.684,0.113,-0.9985,0,0,9,0,2,0,114.0,13,1,0,2,32,40,13,8,38,1,77,21,2,5,15,132,152,60,3,18,24,16,1,1,1,4,7,5,6,2,50,44,6,3,19,5,0,12,33,29,0,2,32,9,136,11,94,109,12,89,2,3,2,7,119,36,6,8,38,490,186,5,0.0,0.0,0.049708763943787086,0.05553063563356112,0.0,0.04977664875631289,0.0,0.05443791395385245,0.0,0.0,0.056212055107706924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10392006439885207,0.10682720939987908,0.038967919618966215,0.0,0.05051744253853107,0.0,0.0,0.08383631973732078,0.0,0.047620751509781636,0.0,0.04785852839482938,0.039168669346691436,0.0,0.09315516511713033,0.0,0.08669006042721071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0520140459794407,0.11652046624086475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043879127318670184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04067035854501032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10573253078362893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495023697271311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05729911302917181,0.04511651500707875,0.0526332311260088,0.0,0.13457796330533536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0457803644365132,0.0,0.04802041568416415,0.0,0.02575610655149118,0.03639057407494032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0393550663438729,0.18836780477585185,0.07984000981664847,0.0,0.0868488077414325,0.04272491385515923,0.04074028316019571,0.0,0.05611465403262414,0.0,0.0,0.0542251287066857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05414539154946752,0.057411548568662124,0.0,0.34143096164529163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050164298876802224,0.0,0.05453086688017393,0.0,0.0,0.05316670512746896,0.0,0.045276603075297885,0.0,0.0,0.3359345278099051,0.0,0.05746100383135279,0.05393666403165063,0.0,0.10417641971090832,0.07195893470667485,0.02488604613892977,0.0,0.0,0.04507909281146423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13792233216451308,0.04819937212526512,0.034001937260012716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263064010260962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1789761560117384,0.0,0.05413971213132018,0.07489152188181039,0.03777035558007355,0.1964350943757483,0.0,0.054173820753526884,0.09560492456006048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06903468054800763,0.07748226110083804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05591532933591119,0.14446043680989304,0.0,0.04878513568348181,0.0,0.0,0.0974827967422922,0.0,0.05120740181634311,0.05706293384146319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08700263923097906,0.04845431078002699,0.040508450477483665,0.05099846423014541,0.0,0.04059150045304289,0.0,0.05314011006658959,0.0,0.052287781206232266,0.0421369687923327,0.0,0.0,0.05192552788512818,0.04316014375422178,0.03921505314941606,0.0,0.057021636258752575,0.14421852422980785,0.0,0.04067966312386224,0.0,0.05835003918398575,0.05325212573289023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03829951734172319,0.1228276461797981,0.08904523187272746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06768273699818028,0.09791826970287262,0.0,0.0,0.02970273019800703,0.0,0.09656774786486036,0.048674052753165525,0.05659470250835798,0.1037519770996248,0.0,0.0,0.05302891993121196,0.12254582227334974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3605391506170581,0.04043272085673389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05687117162507253,0.0,0.0491030305099788,0.0,0.03708393606730291,0.0,0.1038216504585964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032802813603180526
alcoholism,WhataboutWidowmaker,2019/03/26,"Needing Advice for a friend with alcoholic Father My friend is going through a very rough time right now because their father is struggling through extreme alcoholism. On a daily basis their father comes home plastered, slurring speech, and barely able to walk. Their family has done many interventions with him but he seems to not care at all. They have also taken him to the doctors multiple times but it was not able to help him. They feel like they have tried everything and are not able to fix this. I am worried for the safety of my friend and their father.

alcoholism,moominter,2019/03/26,"I’m done, so done ✅ I’ve been drinking like a fiend for about three years on and off. I have barely any tolerance now after being an aid worker in a country that didn’t allow us to have alcohol. 

I realised my problem comes from shame, social anxiety and wanting to be needed. My abusive ex made me so uncomfortable in my skin I used to just drink to not feel myself. I thought I got better, for awhile, then I met another guy and found out recently despite him telling me he wasn’t exclusive with anyone, he was seeing someone. I’m ripped apart with rejection. 

So today I am quitting. Cos I can’t do this to myself anymore. It hurts so much. Any words of encouragement would help. I didn’t drink that much but had a weekend bender. So am tapering with beer and I have beta blockers to stop the insane heart beats. 

I have a month of vacation left to get my life in order before being deployed again. And I wanna do this right. So you guys give me strength in words.

Took a couple days off work and decided cold turkey time. On day 3 and I feel like absolute hell. I know about kindling but didn’t think I was in that boat yet. 

My hands are freezing and keep going numb. My head is foggy. Heart could power a truck engine it’s beating so fast. Anxiety and anger hanging out on the bleachers watching all this.

alcoholism,hexbb,2019/03/26,"Vacation cut short by alcoholic father Hi everyone. This is my first time posting here. I'm glad that there's a space for me to be able to vent. My apologies ahead of time for the very long post.

My father is an alcoholic. He knows it. He's been in and out of rehab. But he just doesn't stop. Recently, his partner of a long time left him. He wanted to take some time off from work and travel with me, and I assumed it would be a good bonding experience for us. I was worried about him after his breakup and I wanted to be there for him. We've had a rocky relationship most of my life, and I thought this would be a great time to work on it.

I had a whole list of of things I wanted to do - museums, historical sites, that kind of thing. Fast forward to our trip. He drinks the whole way there. We arrived on Sunday, and slept the rest of that day because of the long journey.

Monday was our first full day to explore. We go out and eat, he starts drinking right off the bat in the AM. We hit a few local spots and eventually end up at a pub where he keeps drinking. I had one beer with him, and we got talking about politics. Him and I disagree with each other on a lot of things. I don't hate him for it but he has some views that do upset me. He's drunk at this point and starts to belittle me - saying I was just young and dumb and would change my mind when I grew up, saying I don't have reliable sources for what I was saying, saying that he would put a bullet in his brain if \[unnamed politician that I support\] ever becomes president. He says some more problematic things and is laughing in my face anytime I try to counter what he says. I was crying. I left the pub and went back to my hotel room - I told him I needed time to cool off.

After a few hours we met up again and go to another place to eat. I didn't want our difference in opinions to ruin our trip. But the same thing happens again at the next place. This time it was more ""civil"". We didn't fight as bad but the debating continued. At one point in our conversation, I mention that I don't think the government should have control over my body. 

We leave. He tries to take me to another bar. He's very drunk and I'm a bit upset again so I had to beg him to go back to hotel. I was subtle and made excuses that I was tired, but my real concern was how hammered he was getting.

Now, Tuesday (today). We were staying in separate rooms on opposite sides of the hotel.  I wake up early. I text him a few times to see when we should meet up and what our plans will be. It takes him a few hours to respond and it wasn't until 4:00 PM we finally meet up - I thought that he was sleeping in because of a hangover. But we meet in the lobby, and I can smell the liquor on him from 5 feet away. He's absolutely wasted. We decide to go out to eat. I'm frustrated that his binge drinking wasn't slowing down but rather speeding up.

Walking to the restaurant, he's literally stumbling on his feet. I had never seen him this drunk before. Red in the face, falling over, falling into people. We make it into the restaurant. He tries to order another drink.

I interrupted him. I had never done this before. I said ""No, I don't think you need anything more to drink. Water is fine please."" The waitress scurried off.

My dad looked at me with more hate in his eyes than I had ever seen. Fuming. He has had a history of violent outbursts (not hurting people, but throwing shit and punching his hand through walls and windshields to intimidate them) and I got scared. I didn't expect this outburst. I thought he would understand that I just want to have a sober day (although it was too late for that). I wanted to diffuse the situation. I asked him, ""Is that OK?""

He was fuming. He said ""No."" He said ""You don't want the government to interfere with your body but think you can control mine? Fuck you.""

I begin to feel a panic attack coming on - I really didn't want to fight again. And I didn't mean to embarrass him. I just wanted us to enjoy our trip and to be able to go out and do fun things instead of just bar hopping and fueling his disease. I said nothing mean to him beyond trying to cut off the drinks - I kept saying ""I love and care about you Dad, I just want us to have a nice dinner without more alcohol. You were falling over in the street. I'm worried about you."" He's not having it. He was so horrible. I didn't recognize the angry man in front of me. He looked like he wanted to hurt me. I decided to leave.

He texts me while I walk to the hotel. ""You can't control me. Fuck you for trying.""

So... I got to my hotel room. I pack my bags. I decide that I can't do this anymore. This isn't the trip I wanted to have. I know I should feel so lucky to have the opportunity to travel but I just don't feel like I deserved his anger for trying to express my concern for him. I call my airline and ask them to switch me to the next flight home. The next flight isn't until tomorrow morning. I'm at the airport right now, I've been here about 6 hours and have another 10 hours until my flight leaves. I didn't want to stay at the hotel because I didn't want my dad to try and stop me from leaving. I haven't spoken to him since the bar.

I've never been more hurt. Saying I love you to your father and hearing ""fuck you"" back is so painful. 

I guess I just wanted to type out what happened... if anyone has any advice, I would love to hear it. I'm sorry for the long post. I just don't know how to repair the relationship between us anymore. I feel like it isn't worth my effort and tears. You shouldn't spend every day of a vacation crying, right? Is that unreasonable for me to expect? I  feel guilty for leaving him behind in another country but I need to be with my other family right now.",1.5098133588671383,3.475894864750636,3.1656168882172966,91.01316459578544,80.06508875739645,5.9796647192154335,22.04975351401492,7.041503590940878,0.5824626590563962,4447,137,963,53,113,1471,409,1183,0.141,0.779,0.08,-0.9973,0,0,11,0,2,0,162.0,24,14,2,11,45,49,17,5,54,2,95,46,13,7,5,168,187,62,0,33,26,6,6,3,1,11,7,14,4,2,48,62,23,8,22,26,2,25,33,28,0,4,56,30,173,21,168,112,22,177,0,4,8,6,142,76,5,11,74,658,221,5,0.07733112766778301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03778354148005972,0.0,0.1239651863687858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02629390930572664,0.202721074962256,0.0,0.0,0.07669169915256896,0.027035861251795284,0.0,0.0318184645157422,0.0,0.07229416543448029,0.04398766080308336,0.03632757001447028,0.08919429571632834,0.03228413073961911,0.07071050649705539,0.042703077455464034,0.06580309393860091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04221278141337529,0.08589744978408381,0.0,0.04316355670833458,0.03948186374360299,0.0,0.039422119253397454,0.0,0.040903039665453785,0.03330695955989872,0.0,0.0,0.13010015291800708,0.0,0.0,0.08494461255305036,0.09974435980229264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040397284660658166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039568296199100544,0.0,0.26514272696326785,0.0,0.11869357401199288,0.0,0.0,0.03424621300945866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0699504322661212,0.03257740516214744,0.03694660321961921,0.0,0.03782234076954788,0.03645045243553522,0.0,0.09775235422309188,0.0552453730573541,0.0,0.042356235222199085,0.0,0.06577781768959133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723707214751306,0.020201161240913056,0.0,0.1098726548753438,0.03243084046861742,0.0927731506933205,0.04262892062829685,0.04259447775724275,0.0,0.06838366080664945,0.0,0.0,0.07634847865912463,0.0,0.0,0.08715780113675893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03878471312276796,0.0,0.1523111671666638,0.0,0.12417685735317978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03436772971090702,0.0,0.04026423471572844,0.06374874807376457,0.0,0.04361644015804585,0.2047062461670302,0.08402049647887204,0.0,0.027310631212449192,0.05667012424851214,0.0,0.0,0.136871229034631,0.06493867089875485,0.0,0.0,0.032872079677927095,0.10469154289346463,0.036586291393850084,0.025809564102146302,0.0,0.0,0.08423626842712244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03904119715899115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08601007695975052,0.08946379945529265,0.0,0.12336379736580455,0.0,0.0,0.03710065131464221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05240157345300416,0.0,0.04114288604420755,0.04536570819794602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0536116670278128,0.0,0.08079456932131633,0.0424431780387116,0.07310291127546567,0.0,0.11109276601149676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03886957115345187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04400987661217064,0.024770150280337667,0.0,0.03817757963759042,0.08302469074856571,0.0,0.13208072099636733,0.14711922212422288,0.24598726626245,0.03871097465987328,0.0,0.030811448328186226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03968964563640712,0.031984553962306865,0.04346171377291279,0.038693487641674566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04328293311570548,0.054735370184386574,0.08242469285991921,0.0,0.06465228538894716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043877223631038416,0.0,0.0,0.08721507604288478,0.03107791558415515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15412609515201986,0.0743259961731544,0.0,0.09208841609615548,0.1803696096941584,0.04444037769284127,0.036650433468817634,0.03694660321961921,0.0,0.18375965838260647,0.0,0.0,0.040252215565428254,0.1860396501074578,0.0,0.0,0.06380627909677533,0.3420892700916676,0.030690924837488826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035843365047725104,0.0,0.08633744238730029,0.0,0.037272223752008345,0.0,0.056297981951431424,0.07853351388889887,0.0,0.1648014430702459,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,shmabo,2019/03/26,"Concerned a close friend is spiraling towards alcoholism and seeking advice TL;DR: friend is developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and has tried to stop drinking but has admitted she feels she’s losing control. How do we approach this topic with her and what are some things we can say as friends that won’t make her feel cornered or attacked?

So over the last few months a close friend of mine (21F if that’s relevant) has begun to develop an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. Obviously being in college it’s always around and we often go out to bars, etc. on Fridays and Saturdays. In September, however, I noticed her behavior change. She’d mention not wanting to drink for a week and then proceed to blackout 4 nights in a row. Around this time she also started serving at a restaurant and I think it’s contributed a lot to this behavior. Often times she’ll have a drink with coworkers after work, then go across the street to another bar, and one thing leads to a next before she’s stumbling home very drunk at 4am on a Monday or Tuesday. 

Last week she acknowledged this was becoming a problem and even mentioned she wanted to get control over the situation. She decided she’d moderate her drinking by having a max of 7 drinks per week (go out 2 nights with 2-3 drinks per night), which I thought sounded like a smart first step to take. However, after saying this on Monday she proceeded to drink pretty heavily for the next 6 nights in a row. I brought this to the attention of my other friends and we decided that this is starting to become a serious and very real problem. 

As her friends and roommates we want to help her get through this, but don’t want to corner her or make her feel attacked. I suggested we should first try only doing activities that don’t involve alcohol (i.e. making dinner at home, going to a paint night, etc.). That being said, I feel we should also directly address our concern over the situation and offer support, but I’m not sure how to phrase it. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,Flipswitched,2019/03/26,"Friends? Jeez, I have always been an ""all or nothing type"". 
It seems like I dont know who I am yet as a sober person, as if I have muted myself for the last 15-20 years and I'm just now finding my voice again.
I want to be friendly with my neighbors but dont know how? Weird concept, I know. Normally I'd just have a drink with them- it was easy. Now- it is just different. 
We have otherthings in common too- we are all athletic. 
How does one befriend people sober- this is an art I have never practiced. I have become avoidant of all consumers of liquor. It has put me in complete isolation- EVERYONE around me drinks daily.

alcoholism,muffinstraw,2019/03/26,"Drinking to hide past trauma and since of failure I have a poor educational background and a ton of ptsd and trauma. I took one year of courses at a community college, but I struggled very hard financially because of how little I could work vs how long it took me to study. I have issues retaining new information. My friends could do most of their homework in a 3rd or less of the time than it took me. I feel completely stuck in life and that I won’t amount to anything. So, I turn to alcohol because it makes me feel happy. I’ve also put on weight and recently had to start wearing glasses. My self confidence is pretty low and making new friends feels impossible now. I find myself being silent during social interactions because I’m in my head too much. I don’t even like the average conversation topics. How much I drink is also effecting my memory, but I feel like it’s all I have going for me at this point. The promise of a buzz after a stressful day.

alcoholism,blessyter121,2019/03/26,"Alcohol withdrawal, benzos and CBD Hey All.  I am 5 days sober today.  I was prescribed a low dose of diazepam for withdrawal.  It worked really well, had no cravings, better sleep, low anxiety and a sense of well being.  I followed the doctors instructions in order to taper off the diazepam.  Tonight was my last dose.  Now I am concerned about what the next few weeks is going to look like.  My goal is abstinence, although I question it sometimes. I wish I could drink socially and in moderation, but from what I've read and experienced that seems to be nearly impossible for an alcoholic.  Also, I cant help but feel like the benzos just mask the alcohol cravings.   My main reason for drinking was to reduce anxiety, but obviously just made things worse in the long run.  With these pills I feel like I function better, almost like the anti anxiety and well being effects of alcohol but without the impulsiveness and recklessness (at least in my case).  I have a few left over, but I really do not want to go against the doctors order and just keep on taking them; developing a dependence.  My current plan is to immediately start going to the gym and eating healthier, to enhance well being and reduce anxiety.  Im also in between jobs right now, so I have a lot of time on my hands (a dangerous thing), I am in communication with a workplace that I will potentially start next week.

I have been looking into CBD oil/products for anxiety and it is something I feel could help in the long run.  It is legal where I am located however it seems to be less regulated than THC products and the herb itself.  I am also adamant towards vaporizing or smoking herb with high THC because in the past when I have smoked I tend to almost always become anxious and paranoid.  I also have the thought that maybe it is not a good idea to replace one substance with another.  Given, the impulsive and addictive nature of the alcoholic mind.  But, to my knowledge, CBD has little to no potential for dependence and no health risks.  I would strictly be using it for medicinal purposes.

Any advice/insight/suggestions on this topic?  Thanks in advance.

P.S.  I am also attending group therapy for alcoholics in hopes to stay sober",5.916240102171134,7.501882372839508,6.78445295870583,71.29555555555554,67.24691358024691,10.030651340996167,34.21243082162623,10.245366335075165,3.918799914857386,1751,82,287,45,29,581,215,405,0.118,0.787,0.095,-0.8111,4,0,10,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,1,7,18,17,1,1,25,0,35,18,2,6,2,60,59,29,0,6,13,0,4,4,0,2,13,0,0,0,17,19,9,1,11,4,0,8,7,4,4,1,8,7,32,13,55,41,7,55,0,2,2,0,7,26,0,10,22,216,49,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134062856175138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784401354038233,0.1494309384544471,0.0,0.0,0.2983452467467597,0.06208509625768475,0.0,0.0,0.0507403001480718,0.07823962629767177,0.2853987748732749,0.08429294998039885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04548420043548966,0.08240566064722435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13198061532394867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11914693538582807,0.0,0.0,0.04812006742321247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527418481811347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14618726654002714,0.0,0.07634908273483984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131817350350425,0.10660897845691723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272151224441835,0.06258295639110202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07931153915504695,0.0,0.0,0.10002481950300786,0.0788341317715592,0.0,0.07410886118250655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423049169114387,0.08059627569864825,0.0,0.07404320513311201,0.0663206410527716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06082063413222497,0.0,0.0,0.08106868325204643,0.0,0.0,0.1458111625960857,0.07478315629383124,0.0,0.13206266063563452,0.1253144830731597,0.0,0.0,0.06343443152388475,0.0,0.07060187912888474,0.0,0.0,0.07496011906853411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07533919885985987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15870636384433334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050560598165933016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07122781672067542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08358512113693578,0.0,0.07463451745183143,0.0,0.0955996953761034,0.0767159538751784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06372022650954567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13585215969963807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07466821132933157,0.07605990870423998,0.0,0.057441753292810864,0.07379547605567267,0.0,0.10562480761530277,0.07952894350354486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05610068710080925,0.0,0.0,0.06869484640495238,0.08532798420451479,0.0,0.09914088516005402,0.0,0.0,0.059235440148894064,0.04350821338061221,0.0,0.07072565639220955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06444282080894262,0.0,0.0,0.04400946252118198,0.0,0.1197022229088104,0.0,0.2683489586983452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858027922896959,0.07192554740998909,0.0,0.054320117802418535,0.0,0.0760383724251556,0.053003876227199404,0.0,0.0,0.0

The second  group was super aggressive! Screaming everyone's names!

That's not my scene.

alcoholism,stuffishappening,2019/03/27,"My husband isn’t an alcoholic by it’s affecting him and me I don’t know how long he’s been drinking daily because he hides it since i don’t really like him drinking any amount of alcohol. In the past he has had memory problems because of it even though he only drank a glass or 2 of red wine a night. Now I’m more lax and just don’t say anything so it’s probably been anywhere from a month to 3 months of him drinking beer or gin and soda every night. I smell it almost every night. He’s a doctor and functional at his job as far as I know, but lately all he cares about is sex and he has been treating me like a sex doll despite me yelling at him about it. One night he penetrated me while I was sleeping and continued after I said no at least 3 times through the night. After that I made him sleep elsewhere. Another night I showed zero interest in sex and he just stripped me and acted like it didn’t matter if I was interested or not. 

I can’t help thinking this is linked to his drinking because it’s not really like him to do that..

alcoholism,Certifried,2019/03/27,"I stayed sober today Quick history: I have relapsed a few times since my first detox last May. I was traveling for work from August to February, every week, and was drinking pretty heavy. I went to detox in January, and decided to go to AA. I got a sponsor and went to a few meetings, but wasn't working the program. I relapsed again. I went back to detox March 9th, and have been to an AA meeting (often 2) every day since I was discharged on the 14th. I am working the program. I have a sponsor. I have a service position. I pray every morning and night to God (my higher power). 

I had a phone call from HR today, I am being investigated for misconduct. I know I'll be found in violation of our travel policy. I can only hope they decide to either ""retrain"" me or ""reprimand"" me. Termination is definitely on the table. 

After the call, the first immediate thought was ""the liquor store is directly across the street, you can walk there faster than driving even"". That thought was immediately followed by a chorus of voices; my sponsor, my AA friends, AA people I don't know well but I've spoken to, AA speakers I've listened to, and probably even a few AA people I haven't yet met. Loud and clear, I heard ""Nothing ever gets better when you're drinking"". I immediately lost the urge to drink, a wave of tranquility washed over me, and I relaxed. There's nothing I can do until Friday when I find the results of the investigation.... except stay sober. One day at a time.

alcoholism,NotFineButTrying,2019/03/28,"It’s about time that I see somebody So today was the day I said to my doctor I’m taking the piss 

I’ve always thought of myself as a binge drinker who drinks about 3-4 days a week, not an alcoholic. I knew during this time that this was totally more than the allowed amount I should have considering what I drank. 

I’m going through a bad bit of depression at the moment and have upped the amount I drink and also to 5-6 times a week. It’s really getting to the point where if I don’t do something I can see my whole life spiralling downwards pretty quickly. 

I went to my doctor to ask for advice and I shall be attending a drop in centre on Monday. I’m nothing but enthusiastic knowing I can tell this person the absolute truth of my drinking habits over the last 5 years. Ive been so ashamed to tell anyone even though I think some people know. 

The only question I may not know the answer to is “ are you an alcoholic? “ . I don’t know. I’ve tried to stop over the last few weeks however I don’t know if I’m too feeble to stop drinking because of low will power or I have a serious problem. 

If I make over 2 weeks sober it will be the longest I’ve not drank since I was 16. Is this my target? Do I have a problem? Will I ever be able to drink again?

Enthusiastic but bloody scared. 

Monday is the day it begins.",1.4931358787198228,3.4303554781021885,3.3345985401459863,89.92532285233017,79.98540145985402,5.9672094329028615,21.852330151600228,7.010146845296331,0.5644030320044924,1027,31,221,12,26,344,149,274,0.17,0.795,0.035,-0.9871,3,0,9,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,1,12,10,1,2,22,0,29,13,1,2,3,34,53,14,0,6,9,0,0,0,0,6,5,1,0,1,12,3,9,2,10,5,0,3,6,9,0,0,10,3,28,1,27,34,8,38,0,2,2,0,8,11,1,7,23,144,40,2,0.10074323503447193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09844512331729977,0.0,0.2153277605553503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08056432865953887,0.08382644192097465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07044201233298966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09418132542015267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08411639320604544,0.061412141012113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099855203885293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19491315695202865,0.0,0.08677000071468229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20622993982832705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4934500849181986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06653995660819043,0.09112802374773367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052634182281824544,0.0,0.057254702098852826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27682923655869496,0.16423836514711826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07115792623626258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724689166955057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09666585107564987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07661976990775053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06984267441664263,0.08796510698437908,0.0,0.0,0.09523492019884984,0.0,0.0,0.10249208787682186,0.0,0.1927953405138213,0.0,0.0,0.11285547941106255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06453869604104764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09582988648647346,0.0,0.1008615530689546,0.0,0.16055863010372887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333584507238075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07755706419868452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16845171094454275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07574637509562798,0.0,0.17610805571591348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06455219717654845,0.09897971692002618,0.07997887548881784,0.176232571512708,0.0,0.09549280721539552,0.0,0.0,0.0683980436287799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32324058562557023,0.0,0.0,0.0933899881802375,0.0,0.1124762241676532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06487534036549526

alcoholism,RGB_0-0-0,2019/03/28,"3 Weeks sober, hasn't been too hard (think it was caught before major dependency), should I go to a group? So, long story short, I got blackout drunk and was belligerent to my now [ex] gf and her teenage son. To say the least I'm so ashamed that I haven't drank since that day, losing 2 people that I love, and plan on staying completely sober for at least a year or two. I'd love to be able to drink socially, or with dinner, but that's something I need to evaluate in the future. 

While it hasn't been effortless, and feel urges to drink here and there, it hasn't been too bad. Each time I feel an urge I just remember that night and it makes it a lot easier to abstain.  
  
Anyway, my question is will it get worse, should I go to a group? Between work and trying to get my life in general order after 2 years of depression and heavy drinking I don't have a lot of free time, and I'm also looking around for a therapist.

alcoholism,PatterPat1,2019/03/28,"Trying to not panic. Asking for help I know I’m crazy for even trying this but what do I have to lose at this point?? Im trying to not do what I usually do when I’m in a situation which is to be in deep denial and drink the time away until shit hits the fan. 

Before I start, a little about me- I’m 34 year old deaf male, a newly recovering alcoholic living in Washington, D.C. I’m 5 months sober and I know I have a long road ahead of me. More importantly, I’m excited there’s a road ahead of me because for the longest time I felt I was at the end. Which is why at this point I’m trying to NOT revert back being in deep denial and also relapse because the situation in front of me is scaring me. So here goes- 

I got a notice from the rental agency that the owners are reclaiming the house I’m living in.  My lease became month to month two years ago and all the paperwork checks out so it’s happening.  I really lucked out with this house, was able to find 4 other people who needed to find an affordable place and moved in together. From that point it was all about finding new roommates for the house though the years. My current roommates have their gfs/bfs places to move in so they’re not interested moving in another house. Crap! Now the reality is that I need to move and soon. The problem is because I was in recovery and took a lot of time off- I’ve used up all my savings to pay rent and bills. I’ve had to reduce my clientele list by 75% because as much as I love taking care of senior dogs, too many of them passed away and obviously I do not have the coping skills to deal with it. I want to be sober so I had to remove myself from that. So now I’m living paycheck to paycheck and also a reduced income.  So this obviously is the worst absolute time for me to move and even just thinking about it puts me in a panic mode.  I don’t have anyone to rely on. Everyone that I’ve known moved out of DC and because I spent the last few years being reclusive and drinking- I’ve become alone. I don’t have a relationship with my family and I know for sure if I ever move back with them, I’ll relapse.  So... I don’t even have enough for a security deposit and moving... jeez it costs money that I don’t have.  I’ve been looking for places in my neighborhood and nearby.. I don’t know what to do, I’m stuck and frozen in fear.  I just want to ignore this until the last day.

alcoholism,alkitx,2019/03/28,"Triggered. Sigh... I’m attempting to not drink and today my fiancé decided to not talk to me. Like less than 5 minutes on the phone and won’t text me back; we’re long distance. I’m beyond over being emotional and I don’t want to cry I want to drink! Ugh 

Instead of drinking I took a bath rather than a shower and it’s a new day, right, it’s after midnight. I made it through another day making it number 3.

alcoholism,neb872,2019/03/29,120 days today And I fucking hate it. My last friend was booze and now it’s just loneliness. I live in a town where single females to single males is 1 to 7. Im a solid 6. I cannot get a god damn look from a 5. The booze was worth the pain. But fuck it. If I’m gonna be alone and miserable. Might as well not risk my history of detoxes and benzos. Trading one pain for another is like choosing to have a toe or finger cut off. ,-0.8995023923444947,1.0123664947368418,1.9381818181818176,96.5490909090909,89.31578947368422,5.138755980861244,18.110047846889948,6.574015621080383,-0.14121052631579012,327,9,80,4,11,114,72,95,0.244,0.611,0.145,-0.9124,0,1,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,4,12,5,2,7,0,8,9,2,0,0,11,15,8,0,1,5,0,1,1,1,2,3,0,0,1,3,4,2,0,1,0,2,0,2,9,1,1,2,2,5,3,9,10,2,8,0,1,1,2,2,4,3,3,5,47,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23620080116934755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23914020817237425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14707947219832446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17619815795959598,0.4216745555755512,0.119151644824671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22516148214469728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2463433308738381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.185898882648279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11141832287266902,0.0,0.20138066415293532,0.0,0.19151249173349288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419350263744471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15453897906821654,0.0,0.4853426480328176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2161736832485881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20505282579510406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Bambibeybey,2019/03/29,"Husband wants to start drinking again... Hello, my husband (we’ve been together for 15 yrs) was a alcoholic for many years. He stopped drinking in Feb 2018. A little over a year ago. He and I have been great, but lately he’s been calling me boring. Or that life is boring...and says he would like a drink. I get a little triggered with him mentioning drinking, as obviously it was a big problem before for him ...blacking our, mental and emotional abuse, acting like a drunk jerk, him sitting on the couch drinking all day on a Sunday to oblivion...it makes me want to throw up when I think about him during that time. But, our marriage survived, and we’ve gotten stronger, communication has been awesome. 

So why is he bored? He thinks drinking is a solution to this? He knows I get triggered when he mentions drinking...I clam up and get on the defense, I get bitchy about it, So he starts throwing out things about my personality he doesn’t like...that I’m scared of everything, I’m bad at handling stress, I’m worried about our daughter moving out, I’m insecure...etc. like he brings up my weaknesses all at once when I get clammy about him drinking again..,it makes me feel horrible. Like I’m a basket case. I’m pathetic for not giving him a chance at trying to drink again with possibly no bad effects, like I live in the past or I can’t move on from the bad times. Am I supposed to give that a chance? Why does he have to put me down when I get defensive about him trying drinking? Help please.... I’m not sure what to do.

alcoholism,respect_commander,2019/03/29,"Looking for advice Hey everyone, hope it’s the right place to ask. I’m basically looking to get outside opinion on my situation. I had various addictions in my family, alcoholism was super present there so I know what it looks like from the outside. I noticed that I have a tendency to regulate my emotions with stuff, whatever it is. I stopped smoking weed about 6 months ago and it’s just the best. Before that I wasn’t really a huge drinker but now I notice I think about it more often. I had a few incidents within those 6 months without pot that I’ve gone too far in my opinion with booze. I’m worried I might be substituting one thing with another. I guess I’m just really anxious about stopping drinking or just admitting it’s becoming a problem. Do you have any advice? 
With weed it was an easy decision because I could clearly see the negative impact and how I was thinking about it wasn’t healthy. Haven’t really experienced this with alcohol. I’m just v anxious about being dependent on anything. Any advice appreciated. 

Lots of respect for everyone in this community. Thanks :)",3.798658536585368,6.4095570975609775,5.387987804878048,74.68978658536588,75.58536585365854,9.173170731707318,33.17682926829268,9.642632912329526,3.9057756097560974,875,47,148,26,20,295,124,205,0.098,0.726,0.177,0.9511,0,0,4,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,2,15,7,0,0,9,0,16,5,0,2,1,33,34,6,0,3,7,0,0,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,17,7,4,2,5,1,0,1,5,1,0,1,8,5,18,6,24,22,5,18,0,0,4,0,4,10,0,9,8,105,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1282171522635579,0.0,0.34479454880760874,0.10425814699162868,0.2513882372386577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599637697671579,0.12332904546510498,0.0,0.2657417871851411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09678670206396704,0.0,0.10995366931374648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169670011089224,0.12989596128536174,0.10008126641013118,0.0,0.12342914871955125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09390559813847156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11521742175084325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323004683092081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22477136672158973,0.0,0.0,0.11087647168610254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06144871552186538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12956561829754154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1168177245040916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06463784661590356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05746049780681145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962996433846542,0.0,0.0,0.09999163160234922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12477038510323768,0.0,0.0,0.18775752412487628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26780974783098643,0.0,0.0,0.07969862082706307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12288210679399544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11254118065082913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260405577468963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044212995527046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09372351918566216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13220361215253326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19666195647494888,0.0,0.0,0.1346404495230116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10828361837084698,0.0,0.0,0.0781378395573887,0.15072522944781594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11337616916625115,0.0,0.0,0.1194432215143612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,WhiteKnightKeith,2019/03/29,Im 15 and think im going to become an alcoholic I'm 15 doing my GCSEs in about a month. I'm sometimes allowed to have a few beers over the weekend (don't judge my parents their fucking perfect) and I'm allowed to drink when my friend comes over. During the week when stress is high I always seem to think about alcohol and how being drunk seems to just make my stress dissapear and am starting to crave the feeling of the relaxation it gives me. I'm not addicted (at least not yet). Does anyone have any advice or maybe some experience in the matter and can help me feel a bit more secure and safe about my mental health. ,4.911190476190473,5.373387698412703,5.630277777777781,82.74875,68.84126984126982,8.204761904761906,27.654761904761905,8.07648339933343,1.6545904761904766,494,15,99,6,8,161,84,126,0.061,0.8029999999999999,0.136,0.8297,3,0,4,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,1,1,8,8,1,2,9,0,8,8,0,4,1,25,24,10,0,0,4,1,2,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,1,7,5,2,6,5,0,2,3,3,0,0,0,2,9,5,15,23,5,15,0,0,0,1,5,6,1,4,7,60,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16833262581901298,0.0,0.15089029495201398,0.0,0.33004041446351484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284837290057109,0.0,0.0,0.10500592520360867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10796894411599947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1705366860863007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685786664961144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133012861025752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.135127586831949,0.0,0.0,0.15126565206774245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15104524168293082,0.0,0.0,0.1561513927301954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929886235521107,0.14275204504645844,0.0,0.14812672384865208,0.08775629097685768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16413347031835449,0.0,0.0,0.10349957218016613,0.16314548633213696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3335844081727723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030716705582256,0.0,0.15512830300952038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15561167470051665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12325073710984352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145702031384916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2811430298705278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15271810013841888,0.0,0.10929409774608438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3537584326352048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19788283550371244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12386054702857227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Joleney14,2019/03/29,"Looking for perspective: Long Term relationship with my SO who abuses alcohol Ok so, long story short, I’ve been with my bf (26m) for 10 yrs now, I’m 26f. I don’t know how to best describe his challenges with alcohol but basically he can stop after one drink but he struggles with cravings and is not fun for me to be around when he gets wasted. 

Tbh I’m nervous posting this even but I would love some perspective and objective support.

The bad:
He has been going through cycles throughout our time together, each time getting better and better, but still it’s VERY hard for me as I think his past episodes have really effected me. Currently looking for a therapist for myself to process through these times. When he is “blacked out” He has cut himself (more of a release of energy, not suicidal), talks in circles, gets argumentative, emotional abuse, punched furniture on 3 occasions, and attempted suicide once (3 yrs ago). Resistant to the idea of AA and I don’t want to push him because I want him to get help for his own reasons, not mine. 

The good:
No physical abuse. We are able to speak openly about how I feel after episodes, he recognizes that he is creating an issue for me and us. Is stuck between feeling really bad, working on it, and managing himself. He explained never wanting to attempt suicide again, apologized to me for it. Just a very sweet, caring, and honest guy. I can tell he is really sorry and is trying his best. He acknowledges and supports that I don’t enable him and supports me in getting help for what we’ve been through (he knows it’s because of him). 

Where I’m at now:
He mentioned a ring recently and basically is giving clear hints of engagement that may occur in an upcoming trip. I was definitely ready for this and very happy as he hadn’t had an episode in a longg time, months. However, 3/4 weeks ago he had a pretty bad one and it made me feel horrible. Before this I felt so happy and was starting to feel 100% that I would be happy with him for the rest of my life. But since this episode, I’m just worried about the fact of this cycle that I will have to keep living with him and what that will look like if I want to have a family and be happy. I’ve talked to him about this concern specifically, and he agrees that he doesn’t want that either and that it will keep getting better but he can’t give me a solid answer on if episodes like this one wont happen again, and I get it. It’s just really hard. It would be easier if he was a horrible person so I could leave him. 

I honestly cannot think about what I would say if he dropped down on one knee and asked the question. I want to say “yes” but I’m also afraid. Has anyone else experienced this?

alcoholism,Civilized-Penguin,2019/03/30,"I took wellbutrin for 3 days and stopped. Last time I took it was around 33 hours ago. Would it be safe to drink? I don’t want to if it isn’t safe but I cant find an answer anywhere. Ive seen people say its incredibly dangerous and ive also seen many people say that they had no problems.

Im not an epileptic and I don’t drink much but when I do its hard liquor. I stopped taking that stuff because I don’t want to deal with any of the possible side effects and my friend took it a while ago and when he got off it he felt absolutely terrible for weeks and had hallucinations.",1.1181707317073195,3.0633004308943086,2.797743902439024,93.26051829268292,81.27642276422766,6.051219512195122,21.6321138211382,7.1686216300943375,0.4409138211382113,455,14,106,6,12,150,77,123,0.168,0.746,0.087,-0.9028,0,0,2,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,1,1,4,6,1,0,4,0,13,3,0,1,0,24,23,13,0,5,4,0,2,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,10,8,3,4,4,3,0,3,7,3,0,0,10,6,12,3,9,11,1,18,0,0,2,0,7,3,0,1,12,62,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26669108075651343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12029739288597982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229634774852378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339130081009371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09169964645921044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701375704208197,0.15508488915252802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2947247732225534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14443468113510485,0.0,0.13748866750037111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11622046932902548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031118911358404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13475413767056918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1481414948734075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16248829080720614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12261907638148364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15251060405717826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105820499172412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085759736176152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16958521537198007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439394904064119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23925311598503765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515294546727643,0.0,0.0,0.1722043218345225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11310330013516072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771590457509773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5013938609265209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774529227913343,0.0,0.12066444409292985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10685989122520692,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,TwigMay,2019/03/30,"Just looking to talk to someone, anyone. This is the first time I’ve visited this forum and I just want to say it’s so wonderful seeing so many good news stories from all of you doing so well and achieving all these sober coins. Well done!

I came here because I don’t really know where else to go, and as I use Reddit so much generally (different user) I thought I’ll give it a try. My mum is an alcoholic, has been for as long as I can remember. She is a middle class, well presented, well spoken lady now in her 60s who’s battled with binge drinking since her mum died 15 odd years ago. She’s been to rehab about 12 years ago, was dry for a number of years then it all came back again and she’s been on/off ever since. She’s been running in the same circles for years; she’ll be dry for weeks, maybe even months, then she’ll binge drink herself into oblivion and be completely out of it for 4 or 5 days, sometimes longer. She’s lost two jobs because of it.
Generally, I have been a supportive daughter and I’ve taken her to support services, accompanied her to the doctors, etc. For a long while my auntie and my dad would call me when she was in a state (sometimes suicidal) because I would be the only one she would listen to for some reason.
However, I had my first child 18 months ago. She’s had blips throughout that time, including ruining my daughters first Christmas by getting hammered at 9am and ruining dinner, putting us through a general awful atmosphere all day. Then she was dry for months, and it’s the best she’s ever been because she wanted to look after my daughter 2 days a week whilst I was at work. We genuinely believed that this was the ‘reason’ that would keep her sober and on the right track, so she’s been having her 2 days since last July. Everything has generally been fine, bar a few slip ups on a couple of weekends where we had to threaten her and say she wouldn’t be able to look after her if she continued. However, on Monday, I had a phone call from my cousin. He had stopped by her house to see my daughter mid afternoon, and the front door was locked which was unusual - but the car was there and so was the pram so she was clearly in. He looked through the window and there she was in the lounge... asleep in the chair, my daughter sat on the floor crying, clothes everywhere, baby wipes everywhere, toys etc. A complete mess. He said he tried to bang on the window and even that didn’t wake her up, so he had to get a spare key from a neighbour to get in. She was passed out from drink.
I have NEVER been so angry in all my life. Until that point, I was understanding that it’s a horrible disease that never goes away and she’s trying, she’s just bound to have slip ups. However, when she put my daughters life in danger like that, I snapped. She made a conscious decision to have a drink whilst she was the sole carer of an 18 MONTH old BABY. I could have driven to her house and happily punched her, shook her and screamed at her. I cried and screamed and shouted at my dad about how much I hate her. She’s tried to apologise since BY TEXT but is apparently too scared to face me.
Tomorrow is Mother’s Day (uk) and my parents, my Nan and my husband’s parents are supposed to be coming over for a big family roast dinner. Now, it’s just my in laws and my Nan. My mum will be sat at home on her own on Mother’s Day... and that makes me cry thinking about it. The trouble is, I don’t want her here and my husband doesn’t want her here... I doubt my in laws do either since they’ve been told about it. So I don’t know what to do. She knows she’s royally F’d up this time. It also means I have no childcare so I’m likely going to have to quit my job, which means we’re going to struggle to pay the mortgage.

Just wanted to rant, I don’t really have anyone else to talk to. Also, sorry about the length and format - I’m on mobile.",3.5132199319591777,4.560153172370086,4.435037022213333,87.91986391835104,72.40937896070976,7.5140284170502305,25.75592021879795,7.85451343220497,1.2678917617237015,3019,94,645,39,57,978,335,789,0.103,0.845,0.051,-0.9922,10,0,5,0,0,0,94.0,3,1,0,9,46,25,3,4,39,1,74,15,3,6,10,97,121,54,2,12,10,18,0,2,1,8,5,7,4,1,29,35,8,3,14,7,2,15,10,14,4,5,43,13,96,11,98,63,15,112,0,3,6,0,88,41,0,5,57,432,125,8,0.05870281817072906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15610951914894353,0.06273545995751371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09388924496477596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08209275074696179,0.06014797439401521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05515323005000776,0.0451388436645736,0.0,0.14313877238806852,0.0,0.0,0.0661379738251824,0.06160498599410728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988428144170485,0.13428077075622935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05056727995133383,0.12309757596831175,0.0,0.0,0.0468694236175385,0.06495355176046537,0.19344686786568754,0.2271507681428445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06092425728147801,0.06133195073046281,0.0,0.0600848218491306,0.0,0.06007336417180013,0.0,0.2300256536441145,0.0,0.0,0.09807734400108103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13093831929910246,0.07754531552460542,0.10620011967038044,0.0,0.0,0.05275830779228472,0.0,0.05533979255433702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14979776144302073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09200939887420853,0.05631309224811376,0.10008649312020282,0.0492371387452638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05795687966161105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0588837129604736,0.0,0.0,0.1354703411555685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11650697808201987,0.052177762021712835,0.0,0.0,0.09678460096592822,0.04785063176991527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292707304513589,0.057358463528677586,0.0,0.0,0.10390029362227328,0.1971823303234501,0.0,0.06408106050912611,0.0,0.0,0.055546025927907264,0.039184586963815216,0.05951544385347689,0.058974871047537576,0.12788915661754136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18742411762528952,0.0,0.08630665157662762,0.0,0.09055046457442796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0615987327932775,0.0,0.039778548833361335,0.044646138469136315,0.0,0.0,0.13036506513687215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05549313759900623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802509217751413,0.0,0.06243767299728638,0.0,0.0,0.07521305698347291,0.12071254804013913,0.0,0.0,0.06649884955694159,0.05013188597105343,0.05583982289046159,0.09336567433591972,0.0587717617783289,0.0,0.09355709160516283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427978890450596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04973870733821351,0.0,0.11611717639604995,0.06571299887162059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04907818452892675,0.0,0.06136893130034789,0.0,0.06421135522584415,0.13323052480054995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436620324480152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03761439556789429,0.0,0.046603480459138924,0.1026902560527322,0.0,0.0,0.05609305841613775,0.0,0.15942144073495232,0.0,0.057344123499708965,0.06111170398180401,0.07061226237202524,0.0507003870107551,0.0,0.0,0.17312221547334986,0.0,0.09417571967430363,0.0,0.2111235338421318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06366070221158482,0.042736350775480825,0.0,0.0,0.16680319104940586,0.0,0.0,0.15121076101781708
alcoholism,daliciasunicorn,2019/03/30,"Last night I ordered $50 worth of wine while I was drunk and it’s being delivered this afternoon. I regret doing this and I am worried about the temptation. So I’m(25F) hung over right now. For the past 3 years I’ve been struggling with drinking. I go on massive drinking binges and it’s had horrible consequences. My last drinking binge sent me to the hospital with acute alcohol withdrawal. I’ve ended 2 jobs from drinking on the clock, done some really fucked up things being under the influence, it’s put a strain on my relationship, and it tanks my bank account as you can tell from the title. I barely even remember ordering the wine but got the confirmation email today. Why the fuck did I do that! That’s so much money. I want to cancel the order and get a refund but my addiction is not giving me much strength right now. What if it’s too late to cancel? I’m worried I’ll drink the wine so I’m not “wasting money” on it.

alcoholism,BarterTownAZ,2019/03/31,"Weekend Warrior I have been drinking heavily (12-15 Drinks) each weekend night for the last 20 year. Used to be Friday and Saturday night, I now have it down to just Friday, but am miserably hungover on Saturday and sick of being a slave to this. I am struggling to give up Friday. Starting every Monday I start to get excited and countdown to my Friday “fun day” only to regret it every single Saturday morning. 

What did you all do to fill the time that you used to drink?  Is life still “fun”?

Appreciate any advice to “get over the hump”.

alcoholism,Timetoquit1234,2019/03/31,"I’m worried, will I experience withdraw? I’m a very anxious person, even more so when I think I’m getting sick or am sick. Yesterday afternoon/evening I drank 9 beers. I’ve had a night with 10 but for some reason this was the tipping point. I sat down and listened to all the voice memos I took while feeling sick after drinking and realized that I needed to stop. I used to just have maybe 6 a week but this year it got worse.


January - 48

February - 71

March - 62


For the past two or three months I’ve had a drink almost everyday. I’d skip a day or two then drink 6 or more on the weekend. These past two weeks it’s been 16 a week, 9 last night. Now I’m worried with work on Monday that I’m going to experience withdrawal symptoms. The anxiety of guessing seems to make it worse. I haven’t had a drink today. I’ve been drinking water, eating well, and went to the gym for some cardio. I have some prescribed Xanax, which I hear is used in withdrawal, but I only like to use it in emergencies.


Do you think I’ll have withdrawal problems? Did anyone have similar drinking habits when they quit? This might be all in my head.",2.1568609022556373,4.142424723684211,3.549548872180452,88.95184210526315,78.07894736842105,6.798997493734339,24.453634085213032,7.793537801064563,1.252989724310777,879,31,184,14,21,288,134,228,0.146,0.8029999999999999,0.051,-0.9717,0,0,7,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,1,2,7,3,0,0,13,0,18,17,1,5,2,34,42,15,0,2,8,0,1,1,0,2,6,3,0,1,11,5,10,1,6,9,0,3,1,1,1,4,12,4,14,2,20,27,7,34,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,11,25,106,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717344405794863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423678703004198,0.10962972385931613,0.0,0.06785395203544124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06258399670346303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5703847000107892,0.0,0.09929808909379642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12819051797638706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18985119597583355,0.0,0.0,0.0490672998579965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050700386909631266,0.0,0.0551511474665754,0.0,0.07761327148280776,0.0,0.10690259221990564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09959298484233564,0.0,0.10937327283138527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910209959925253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04740977001852427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477622104701361,0.0,0.09749163074558193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029461193106126,0.0,0.0,0.0774579178545918,0.0,0.0,0.07195533840821612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18213449660612727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07380473697586654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852749460068826,0.0,0.08473324302399568,0.0,0.0,0.09173596115801896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285599143619876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10321600458538004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09977523435703163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08834330010413857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113137271467487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10086368961876198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12436106084801753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919843733295585,0.0,0.10781712029339824,0.0,0.0,0.2843875034074924,0.0,0.0,0.2514391293094833,0.0,0.08006972962818178,0.0,0.0,0.23352347342021024,0.0,0.08725232135924653,0.08995881248560737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07064765815017081,0.19710151768285725,0.19778797096601985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062491801236939634

alcoholism,FloridaGirlNikki,2019/03/31,"Daughter of alcoholic, need advice/support Hi everyone.  FTP here.

My mom is an alcoholic and her health is in bad shape because of it (wet brain, or fluid on brain. confirmed this week).  She has little to no balance, tremors, and cognitive loss.

In January she went into the hospital bc her weight was so low.  Was there for a couple weeks, then skilled nursing facility for three weeks.  Two weeks after she got home, my step-dad (her caretaker/enabler) suddenly passed.  I've had to move in ever since (two weeks tomorrow).

I can't take it with her asking for drinks (2 a day, but still).  Right after 12:00 she's asking.  I'm stuck between understanding her hell of losing spouse, and not wanting to enable.

alcoholism,sonjat1,2019/03/31,"Dealing with severe alcoholic daughter My 22 year old daughter is a really severe alcoholic.  She tries to hide it from me so I can't be totally sure of how much she drinks, but it seems to be some form of hard liquor every 4-6 hours all day, every day.  She can't keep a job, stopped going to school and just lies around the house drunk and so sad.  I fear if she continues like that she won't live much longer.  I am desperate to help her but nothing so far has worked.  She has tried AA, detox (like 4 times), rehab, and she just goes right back to drinking.  Is there anything I can do as a Mom? I have been told I need to kick her out of the house but not sure I can handle making my daughter homeless.",2.170662100456621,3.635577732876712,3.2180136986301378,93.66117579908678,76.46575342465755,6.510502283105023,21.755707762557076,7.1686216300943375,0.42091050228310495,543,14,124,6,12,174,96,146,0.192,0.7509999999999999,0.056,-0.9594,1,0,4,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,1,9,6,0,1,5,0,15,8,0,2,4,24,21,12,0,2,7,4,1,2,0,1,4,0,0,0,3,6,6,2,1,4,0,1,4,2,1,0,2,1,19,4,14,16,6,14,0,1,0,0,16,4,0,3,11,78,22,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2974873534335807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145352708656742,0.12390186036536012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10702268818878627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17952229061252634,0.14349096143124734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726915645902641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345343800296414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15661891521391472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910057558341421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12468010827393655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09329104091520043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13706664552173708,0.3211956466598569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381170736200731,0.12371172812344608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13599499807380627,0.0,0.12290062499360355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09290534475357144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630087657436152,0.0,0.0,0.2046301834611006,0.10320199933897536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13354928379756098,0.0,0.14604853464009473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891638209109147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11886102445301801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14086003756424315,0.0,0.12670644597940178,0.0,0.3144730311759417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116362733585782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26235556353102496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08115838718441093,0.0,0.0,0.13299476488666032,0.0,0.18899145123398944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013264579252062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962891388764035
alcoholism,moonagemama666,2019/03/31,"Am I to blame? I could write so much, but I’ll try to keep it basic. One of my dearest friends is an alcoholic. He drinks every single day, all day. Over the last few months he’s tried on and off to quit drinking. During those times I’ve never told him when I was out at a bar or talked about drinking, and just generally tried to be mindful of my language when speaking to him. But when he does relapse, I have mentioned if I was out with other friends- when he asks. I’ve never asked him to come drink with me since knowing he had a serious problem (it wasn’t obvious until we became very close and he became more comfortable opening up to me) but there have been times that he’s asked if he could come by to say hi and I said yes, clearly not thinking about whether or not he could handle being in a bar. I understand that this is enabling on my part and it’s something I’ve constantly tried to be more aware of so I don’t do it as often/eventually ever. But regardless of those few times I’ve said yes to hanging out with him in a bar, he goes out and drinks on his own anyways, multiple times a week. I only go out once or twice a month for context.. What brought me here today is an argument we had. He started going on about how he’s going to distance himself while he gets sober and my response was “oh :(“ but I quickly realized that would read as “oh :( don’t abandon me” and not “oh :( I’ll miss you but I understand” so I clarified that RIGHT AWAY and said I completely understood and apologized for how my comment may have come off. He then promptly blamed me for every single relapse he’s ever had since meeting me. He said I’m the biggest compromise to his sobriety in his life. And because I “made everything about me” I am responsible for his drinking. I’m beating myself up HARD over this. I feel sick, I’m crying and shaking, I’m heartbroken. I know logically that what he said to me isn’t true and he was probably lashing out (not to mention he was drunk) but my emotional nature is telling me that if it weren’t for meeting me he would be sober now. He wouldn’t be killing him. He wouldn’t hate his life and living. He would be accomplished. He would have pride. I feel like I took away everything good he could have been by now. I feel worthless. I feel like a monster. I’d also like to point out he has been drinking this way since he was in high school, over a decade ago. I met him about three years ago. Still, I feel responsible. This was longer and messier than I intended, I just need support I suppose.

alcoholism,griux,2019/03/31,"23yo economy student/beer problems Hi,
I'am not able to decide if I have alcohol problems or not.
There is no moment in my life, when I would have spirit, short drinks, shoots, or any kind of drink, eventhough I was in trouble, stress, or bad situation.  Here at the dormitory parties I like to have 5-6 good quality beers maybe some wine.  If I'm not drink for like 6day I don't feel anything, like depression or anything. Maybe I just endlessly love beer or something. What is your opinion?
Now I'm sober - day 7 - still don't feel addiction, but a beer would be great.

alcoholism,CJemane,2019/03/31,"how do YOU define alcoholism? I drink very little. I drink maybe 2-3 cans of cider on fridays or saturdays but not every week. I know my limits... I get ""Asian glow"" and I don't like it.

my bf (31M, not Asian) drinks heavily (by my definition maybe not by yours I dont know)... sometimes half a carton (12 cans+) of beer over a period of 10 hours, sometimes a WHOLE CASK (2 litres) of wine a day, he even ""breaks fast"" with beer after intermittent fasting. to ME that does not look healthy at all\_ and he is absolutely, eh, fine. he does not act like an alco. completely functional at work and whatnot. but I certainly don't like it :/

&amp;#x200B;

he is never ""violent"" but can be condescending when I decline his request to grab a 6pack of beer while I'm out and he's at home, commenting on facebook messenger ""well maybe one day you'll be useful"" ""what's the point of me going out, you are already out"" making me feel like a failure. I'm currently jobless so I don't always have enough money to spend on alcohol I don't consume myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to point out that -I- think he's drinking a lot because he'd say something like ""oh, so you think you can dictate how much I can drink. are you a doctor? no?"" (ironic, not every Asian is a doctor you know)

IF him drinking that much is in fact too much, then I want to change that. without much... repercussion. any insight? 

&amp;#x200B;

thanks!

please excuse any typos of grammar errors I might have made, I have a flu and not feeling myself!

alcoholism,Sequoiiathrone,2019/04/01,"Dealing with being sober I used to drink 5-6 a day and about 10-12 on weekends for the last 5 years or so. I just quit about a month ago and am having a hard time being sober. I don't have cravings really, just trying to get used to being sober is weird. I feel a lot more bored now and thinking about a hobby perhaps. I'm just not sure what to do.

alcoholism,comphypotato,2019/04/01,"Thinking about quitting, but forever is a long time Hey guys, first post here. I am 21 and I've been drinking since I entered college. My freshman year I went crazy, drinking 2-3 nights a week and blacking out for about half of them. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression by my sophomore year, and after starting medication, I began to drink less. I haven't blacked out in over a year. However, with the medication, new issues have surfaced. If I drink too much, I start getting EXTREMELY depressed and tend to run away from my friends. I started drinking less and less often, but my meds stopped working recently and I relapsed into the binge-drinking and running away phase. I will be quitting for a month while I wait for my meds to kick in again, but I'm thinking about quitting forever. This is a super hard decision because a lot of my friends drink and it was one of my main social activities. I don't know if I could just go to the bar and not drink, or maybe just go and only have one beer type thing for the next forever. Advice is appreciated!",4.717941176470589,6.177166284313724,5.2738039215686285,81.47511764705884,69.98039215686275,8.185098039215687,33.69803921568627,8.648137234880735,2.8009298039215684,838,41,158,14,15,269,121,204,0.099,0.813,0.08800000000000001,-0.0852,1,0,9,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,1,6,9,5,0,0,10,0,14,12,0,0,0,34,28,18,0,3,9,0,1,0,2,1,3,0,0,1,3,16,9,2,4,9,0,6,3,2,0,4,5,3,22,3,27,20,6,36,0,2,2,0,6,9,0,5,20,111,25,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08754727144234913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06853685657157887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16834735487017385,0.0,0.0,0.05461383152230225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07153110962991686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15432916430277233,0.09093296160145953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7021204435018215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07620604414749142,0.0,0.0,0.13843554204326525,0.0,0.04680759074800424,0.0,0.10183324022751787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887091583826764,0.0,0.0,0.08025592306887673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09350970950810633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04923686110497952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928520045736485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07616704971811085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000618400464064,0.0,0.19903076995631733,0.1805069793137829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07151066767187775,0.0,0.06585968078140209,0.0,0.0,0.08652752940297921,0.09528102652705576,0.08407506823792968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214183370692625,0.06813797949487051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858033962258648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2858731143346851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08846028711490565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411058672671879,0.0,0.0,0.09132672444064548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19023887610795692,0.0,0.0,0.07490207318577477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059520267997042735,0.11481256842353338,0.0,0.0,0.052241222504839466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186448230588162,0.0,0.0,0.08305173856972815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06522330245511239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17308096657830233
alcoholism,mary-goore,2019/04/01,"Guilt My last drink was on New Year’s Eve. Honestly quitting has been relatively easy for me so far, mostly because I just have so many regrets that it’s easier to ignore the urge to drink. 
I’ve always had issues with alcohol but they were definitely the worst when I was 16-17. My dad was working in another country and my poor mom would find me passed out on the floor or puking or crying or saying weird shit. She used to have to throw buckets of water on my head while I was lying on the bathroom floor. I’m almost 21 and the guilt is killing me. I am repulsed by alcohol and don’t think I’ll ever touch the stuff again, but for the past 5 years I’ve done so many things I regret. I don’t know if I can ever live with the shit I put my family through (not just the alcoholism but also other stuff). I know I should be somewhat proud that I’m better but I can’t get over the guilt. I wish I could delete the past and start over knowing what I know now.

alcoholism,lenny_capri,2019/04/01,"25(M) with issues Hello. I've been drinking since i was 12. Let's say i was a really good kid. I picked up drinking 13 years ago, my life is shit at the moment. All I do when i'm sober is day-dream about random things. I pitty myself a lot. I blame myself for my family situation and my father's current mental and physical condition. My self confidence is really low. Most of my previous friendships have ended due to rude behavior while hammered. I'm not looking for a big life change, i'm honestly fine with my life being shit(can't expect butterflies and sunshine after 13 years of abscence). All I want is this to stop. I need to stop.

alcoholism,walkingceberus,2019/04/01,"Two days sober and I have The Fear I had dts yesterday and this morning, but they have stopped now. Now I can't stop thinking that I have screwed up my entire life - I have one person left who stands by me. I have ruined my relationship with everyone else. I'm filled with panic and fear and while I know the above statements are true, I also know part of this is withdrawal anxiety. All I can think is why did I let it get this bad before stopping? Why wasn't losing my right to see my kids enough? Why have I been lashing out drunk at the people who were telling what I can see so clearly now?! And worse than all of that is the revolting little alcoholic gremlin in my head saying 'it will be fine, you can still drink'. I'm ignoring it and trying to keep myself busy. Tomorrow I'm going to an alcohol support group which lasts all day. I'm going to stop making excuses and try harder - I have to.

alcoholism,Gayboy69x,2019/04/01,"Blacking out every time I drink, no change in amount I’m a huge binge drinker and I party at least once a week and I have for the past 9 years (I’m 24) 
But the past 6 months I’ve started blacking out EVERY time even though I haven’t been drinking more than I have before. 
Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve tried drinking less but I think I feel “fine” and just keep going then don’t remember anything. 
Like I got punched at the club last weekend, no idea why or what happened. In fact I remember getting there and that’s about it. But I remember a conversation at the very end of the night and I think I was fine. 
What does it mean and has this ever happened to anyone else? 
I’m terrified to quit drinking because I love it and have so much fun, but I hate this feeling of wondering wtf happened last night.. what I do remember is great though and I have FOMO ",1.5815819209039574,3.7795781468926566,2.7783333333333324,92.65755649717516,81.09039548022601,5.741242937853108,23.39265536723164,6.937597516519254,0.7050655367231644,680,24,146,8,18,218,100,177,0.11,0.7290000000000001,0.162,0.8232,0,0,5,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,8,7,1,0,8,0,12,5,0,0,2,30,31,17,0,0,6,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,10,4,1,11,6,0,1,4,1,0,0,3,5,16,6,14,28,5,25,0,0,2,1,2,8,0,2,17,87,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442519524180477,0.21138194691687914,0.08488495311085009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288023971612862,0.0,0.08777438868496433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912068375818346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902686341227237,0.0,0.0,0.404197073949665,0.0,0.0,0.17233980140026,0.0,0.09136167410259063,0.0,0.0,0.06813063920696961,0.09330650069640686,0.17381929340392288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10431306640327752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05389243795442239,0.0,0.05862341441802677,0.0,0.0824997336861029,0.11372497019486427,0.0,0.0,0.2736497783346279,0.0,0.0,0.10184081994054328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11644556699327825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168585503531684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16816459418014565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05039464676494193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309831932354436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11236229976043643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233459913230656,0.0,0.07582827279699525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19360152172410816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985305565593284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19693969101226125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971439198157837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4674024829164525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301121223665527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13219072208746332,0.2026917877928469,0.0,0.1202970200992572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07003314505259789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08511084824077421,0.0,0.0,0.082741967529306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930782478169834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11186347762460504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06642622918883677
alcoholism,snowybone88,2019/04/01,"Suicide isn't an option. Please tell me what to do instead. I'm an alcoholic with a lot of other behavioural addictions.  I am completely stuck, in self pity, inertia, depression, laziness, pride, madness, whatever.  But suicide isn't an option anymore.  I've tried and I can't go through with it.  So at least that's one option off the table.  Please read below and tell me what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my history:

* Until 28 years old, life was a mixture of depression, drinking, eating disorders and dysfunctional relationships
* After a bad break up and 2 suicide attempts I went to rehab, got sober, did AA, worked the steps and was reasonably happy and functional for over a year.  Quit my job to focus on recovery but didn't actually do that
* Got into a relationship and relapsed for a few months, cheated on my boyfriend and put him through hell
* Managed to get 3 months of sobriety through going back to AA and working the steps, though was miserable and getting more and more depressed and stopped going to meetings
* Found out I was pregnant and that that my boyfriend had cheated (before I had cheated on him) and had an abortion as a result
* Started drinking again about 2 weeks ago and can't seem to get through a day without starting drinking again about 2/3pm

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation:

* 30 year old female in UK
* Unemployed, though reasonably intelligent don't have a career path and haven't managed to stick at anything work wise.  Have massive trouble sticking to boring jobs but that's all I'm qualified to do
* Boyfriend is still living with me and probably needs to for a few months now due to finances
* Can't drive due to alcohol reasons, through have lots of AA meetings within walking distance
* Have an energetic dog that needs 1+ hrs walking each day

&amp;#x200B;

I literally don't know how to live my life or do anything.  I just sleep, drink, tidy the house, eat, argue with boyfriend, obsess, ruminate, read reddit, browse memes endlessly.  I'm stuck in my head and I can't get out.  I hate myself and I'm terrified of what is going to happen with my life.

alcoholism,heckttorr,2019/04/01,"Please throw me some advice Hey this is one of my only posts and i apologies ahead of time for the spelling(dyslexic mofo here) i am 20 years old and i think i might have an alcohol problem.. i started drinking when i was 13 at highscool partys and such.. as i have gotten older my drinking has become more destructive. From 13-18 i was getting hella fucked up at parties, i mean blackout every party!. At 18 i went to montreal for university where the drinking age is just 18 i practically solely picked it because of the low drinking age. I dropped out of university after just one year. At 19 I decided id go to nunavut to work as there is a lot of money to be made and pretty much no alcohol.. anyway while i was there I managed to sniff out the black market dealers and soon found myself spending $180 for 60oz of booz roughly weekly ( keep in mind that 60 was always drank within 40 hours of purchase) after this i went to Australia on a working holiday this past year was the greatest of my life for a lot of reasons however i could not avoid the liquor.. for example one night i found myslef surrounded by Australian cops loading me into an ambulance, to this day i still dont know why.

alcoholism,CoffeeBananaGnome,2019/04/02,"How to help Fiance's Family with Father's Alcoholism Hi guys. I've been learning more and more about a situation and I just don't know what to do or how to help or support at this point.

So my fiance and I have been dating for almost ten years now, ever since we were in 8th grade. I've known her family for a long time and we kinda grew up together, so we're all pretty close, except for her father. Her father is in the military and was out of the picture for long stints early on in her life, so I've always noticed that they aren't too close, but still definitely care about each other. I know him well, but not nearly as well as the rest of the family. He would regularly miss invitations over to my home when we all got together, and I just am not nearly on the same level of family as I am with the rest of them. My fiance and her mother are extremely close, essentially each other's best friends (calling each other to talk at least once a day, easily) so they tell each other everything, and I've learned more about his problems over the last couple years.

Growing up dating her, I always knew that her father would not make the best choices at times, and it's caused her parents to get into some rough times (almost split up once several years back, but stayed together), but she never really wanted to go into the details. I knew it usually involved alcohol, but didn't know the extent. 

I've learned more and more about the severity of the issues, at least of the past half year or so, and it's gotten to the point that the fiance, her mother, and myself all know he's really just a full blown alcoholic. He hasn't been violent with the mother, but he was thrown objects around the house (not at her) in frustration just arguing with her, and one night decided to leave home in the middle of the night, fully drunk, for his hometown 2000 miles away. about 3 hours into the trip, he ""got ran off the road by a semi"" and was arrested for a DUI. He is still not willing to get help, and has been telling his wife these last few months that they are done because he says he isn't good enough for them, and he wants to separate after our wedding here in a month. Essentially, he doesn't want to give up alcohol, so he's giving up his family.

It's to the point now that the fiance is helping her mother and soon-to-be high school graduate brother look around town for rentals for after the wedding, but the problem is her mother just doesn't make enough to support herself and son without the financial assistance of the father. The home is in the father's name, so he can't be asked to move out, either. Regardless, the mother alone wouldn't be able to support that home anyway.

I feel so sad and helpless for my fiance's family and this whole situation. I just don't know what to do for them. Her mother is an absolute saint and I love their family, I just feel that their father is about to cause so much hardship in their lives due to his addiction and I can't stand to not do something anymore. As the soon-to-be son in law, I have no idea what I can/should even do.

I appreciate all advice. Thank you.",7.821409151193635,5.91009957371795,7.986660035366935,76.12673076923079,63.67948717948718,11.363306808134393,32.09416445623342,10.085429814115964,2.828692374005305,2450,66,496,43,29,803,260,624,0.076,0.8140000000000001,0.111,0.975,2,1,5,0,0,0,71.0,4,1,9,2,39,20,3,0,39,0,43,8,0,6,6,112,75,48,0,9,26,19,3,0,1,4,6,1,4,1,21,43,5,0,15,1,0,6,20,8,2,3,16,5,56,12,92,53,29,88,1,3,1,1,88,47,0,7,33,353,77,6,0.06401480721906304,0.0,0.0,0.06978558880921171,0.0,0.0625545287349315,0.0,0.2736494430846241,0.12820316502029422,0.0663000344232128,0.0,0.0,0.10653089545109433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0634854874694837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11397350070445834,0.05984520338605302,0.0,0.06014401862090419,0.04922343535322672,0.0,0.039022832316781726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13435918155330626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0653662754551816,0.0,0.06526736232308973,0.13152168140836676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083116660680047,0.0,0.04128425484342661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06550937325145106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13228881618779714,0.0,0.042281176430165435,0.057905058046520665,0.0,0.0,0.057532381029896176,0.0,0.4224322415193136,0.0,0.06473561991940563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049457681261852966,0.0,0.06689018931645592,0.1228176723539249,0.036381090164404786,0.053692583133392965,0.10239697839403053,0.0,0.0,0.06338472354052639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17163110361885878,0.06763515848374198,0.25684828435626345,0.0,0.06304169030982909,0.07386449273825993,0.0,0.07226492544120716,0.0,0.06681482716765043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17590431957879352,0.10436122365208267,0.0,0.06778243783650327,0.0,0.0,0.04521555148158573,0.0,0.0,0.05652624758006849,0.11330217992073045,0.053756315522834885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05777586282014484,0.0,0.08546076180369823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021920167707418,0.06803760925729405,0.04705824894413279,0.0,0.049372165715026464,0.0,0.0,0.1201471201862457,0.0,0.0,0.07288128230618872,0.0,0.1363473609420102,0.043378090087869546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108086777508985,0.0,0.061109376917014624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18154405270883453,0.0,0.0,0.06512607268040377,0.0,0.12250705024017572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08201904939470515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050907144066823715,0.0,0.06478640249314077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14463702213419208,0.0,0.052953710042373967,0.14391065085901758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049281726077750526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682312670543975,0.10224461547288252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21792973386721848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0514526772048827,0.11190352615260653,0.0589362338267225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198264664863586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050326620795531,0.0,0.11327277559280365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511399911844768,0.0,0.0,0.07147024615952349,0.0,0.061707989785454005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094856474775308,0.0,0.0,0.16489374816471705
alcoholism,sallysucre,2019/04/02,"Sober for almost 2 years... But I miss weed. I’ve been completely sober since May 2017, regularly attend meetings and work a program in AA. For me, drinking was very destructive and chaotic at least half the time. I have mental health issues which are obviously exacerbated by alcohol use. Weed, however, didn’t really have any negative aspects for me. I wasn’t a couch potato smoker, and I really feel like it balanced out the alcohol use. Fast forward to now, and I have no desire to drink, but I have times where I really want to just chill tf out and smoke and ride my bike or something. Has anyone else experienced this? Advice? It could either be fine, it could make me want to drink, it would definitely complicate my relationship with AA...I’ve just pushed the feelings aside because I didn’t want to risk drinking. Idk. Just searching for some answers. ♥️",3.70525,6.376831025000001,4.682500000000001,79.30250000000002,76.25,8.0,26.25,8.841846274778883,2.3666875,684,26,121,16,16,222,108,160,0.09,0.812,0.098,0.2822,1,0,9,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,0,1,6,5,1,1,5,0,16,7,0,3,1,33,25,9,0,7,7,0,2,1,0,2,3,0,1,0,6,9,6,0,3,5,0,4,5,3,1,1,5,3,13,2,15,15,3,14,0,1,0,0,2,6,0,4,7,75,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384993666289713,0.0,0.3029378952416839,0.14192463370941327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09638296576737407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910266515431143,0.14522170378852348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08639882146414096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14860383823776915,0.0,0.0,0.2263237497820792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5553755994913587,0.0,0.0,0.11839932385409893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433284294277613,0.10125373215296447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15065502846910395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479319152631756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924334430417042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946075497714686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14283303238918754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723924219974243,0.0,0.0,0.15216767185933455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11724259537787125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10911260920969004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652907305879431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2448227611526012,0.0,0.11694416266562192,0.2507925164361177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103182953970547,0.0,0.0,0.10068270729648864,0.0,0.0,0.0912710883758024
alcoholism,MakeWMGreatAgain,2019/04/02,"I'm starting to become an alcoholic and don't know what to do. Maybe I already am. When I would get drunk it would usually only be about 2 times a week and that was when I didn't have school or work the next day. Now I've gotten to the point where I'm drinking every night regardless even sometimes during the day. It's only a 6 pack a day. I'm 21 years old but was drinking long before this.

I can't tell anyone that I live with because I will get kicked out. I live with my brother and my sister in law and one of the first rules before I moved in was no alcohol because before I moved in with them I was getting drunk all the time with my mother and it was getting out of control. I'm already on strike 2 and if I fuck up one more time I'm out.

Life is decent for me. I have a job, a car, I recently got my GED and now in college and I even quit smoking! But I can't seem to quit drinking. I've been putting on weight because of it. After a night of binge drinking I'll get extremely depressed the next day and it fucking sucks. I've started taking money out of my savings account just to pay for my alcohol.

I'm going down a destructive path and don't know what to do.

alcoholism,DB___Cooper456,2019/04/02,"My Husband is an Alcoholic and I Feel like I Made a Mistake Marrying Him This is a throwaway account. My husband knows my real account and I often post to subs pertaining to my career, so I'd prefer they stay separate. 

My husband is an alcoholic. He drinks the equivalent of 6-10 beers a night. He has anxiety and insomnia and for a long time he has used alcohol as a way to 'wind down' at the end of the night and eventually be able to go to sleep. He is considered a very high functioning alcoholic. He has a great job, manages to get up every morning, go to work and seem completely normal. He has trouble getting up and getting into the office on time, but luckily he works in a field that is very flexible. As long as he gets his 8-9 hours a day in, they don't really care when he gets in and leaves. 

We got married about a year and a half ago. It's been the worst year of my life. When we got married, I was having a lot of second thoughts but pushed them down to avoid making a scene or disappointing everyone. Im ashamed to say I was extremely irritable and grumpy on our wedding day. At the time, I chalked it up to stress but I know now it was because I knew I was making a mistake. I hate looking at the pictures because I look happy, but I know I wasn't. 

The thing is, I really, truly love him. When he's not drinking he's the best guy in the world. He makes me laugh, I love spending time with him. He's my best friend. But the alcoholism is always there, peeking up from under the surface. We have a therapist we see together and he has a psychiatrist he sees monthly to help him with his medications. The psychiatrist has put him on a sleeping medication and naltrexone, which is supposed to help with the alcohol cravings. It hasn't helped. He refuses to buy less beer nightly and I guess just hopes the medicine with make him not want to drink. I can't get through to him that he actually has to make an effort. There isn't going to be a magic pill that will make quitting drinking easy. He has to actively buy less beer, which will make drinking less earlier. He says his anxiety keeps him from buying less because he knows he will never be able to get to sleep, and then he can't relax or wind down. In reality, he doesn't sleep. He passes out.  And lately he's been passing out on the couch and I wake up at 3-4am and have to wake up him up to get to bed and it makes me irrationally angry. I think because at that point, I can't ignore the problem. 

I saw our therapist alone the other day. She asked me what I thought he would be like if he didn't have to work. Like, if we came into enough money to where we wouldn't have to work (won the lottery or something). I told her I thought he would destroy himself. If he didn't have a job to go to or any kind of structure in his life, he would drink himself to death. And then I cried because I knew the extent of the problem. I'm married to a high functioning alcoholic who would not function at all if he didn't have to. I don't know what to do. I feel like we are at a stand still. I refuse to have kids with an active alcoholic, and he refuses to see the problem. 

I apologize for the length of this post. Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I don't know why I'm posting here. Maybe it's just to vent, maybe I need some guidance. I don't know.

On Friday the thought popped into my head to see if I could find any weed. A few  hours later I've scored a quarter ounce. Easier than I thought. Since then I've smoked as often as possible.
I've been stoned all day today. I feel horrible. 
It was hard, but i just threw 80 bucks worth of weed in the rubbish. The truck should take it away at 7am.
I don't want to be a stoner or a drunk anymore. 
I'm thinking I need a meeting, but I've always felt off talking about pot at an aa meeting. I don't think na fits either as it's just weed I'm into, not meth or crack or anything.
The binges I have take their toll tho. I get depressed for a couple of weeks after stopping. 
I hope this last one was my final binge.

alcoholism,shouldiquitbooze,2019/04/02,"Do I need to quit drinking altogether? Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I have a great life and love my job and my girlfriend. I also love drinking, and work in an industry where relationships developed over alcohol are exceptionally important. I genuinely believe that to stop drinking altogether would be extremely damaging to my career.

I handle myself well in social situations and have not had a history of being inappropriate in work situations regardless of alcohol. My girlfriend also drinks a lot, and we're great together in those circumstances. However...

I have a good deal of difficulty with impulse control and struggle to stop once I start. I'll have a few drinks in a work situation and then polish off a 6 pack alone afterwards.

Drinking alone makes me... Dark. Not anything I'd ever act on, but thoughts of self-harm dark.

I've had therapy over several years and am comfortable in saying I'd never hurt myself or others but I'm increasingly worried about the impact on my mental health.

I exercise regularly and take days or weeks at a time off drinking without consistently fixating on when my next drink is.

Would be greatly appreciative of opinions and advice from struggling and recovering alcoholics. Do I need to stop drinking altogether or is this something I can manage?",7.1988053899974105,9.38817660792952,8.071391552215598,60.97779994817313,64.8590308370044,11.684788805390001,39.34413060378336,11.442366930564873,5.607787976159628,1058,59,152,36,17,355,139,227,0.091,0.7829999999999999,0.126,0.9004,2,2,13,0,0,2,25.0,0,0,0,5,7,12,0,2,10,0,18,17,0,3,3,38,27,20,0,5,9,0,0,0,2,2,6,1,0,0,4,12,12,4,2,10,1,2,4,4,1,0,3,1,19,8,30,19,3,31,0,2,0,2,8,15,0,5,14,109,23,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07468735446098529,0.0,0.2450440443766727,0.0,0.15831864684728628,0.0,0.12224346658823075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289608767737365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.086111409209278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857237115755251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04929158347934005,0.07879686338433534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6738583312872161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06913609106912492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641065814020001,0.0,0.2527958878816393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124243299065093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08182081930993451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584583776239934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05398537866001589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06497878628107921,0.13796367530870005,0.0,0.05101819435316405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702433287920284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11334503249251544,0.05894819313386556,0.0,0.08128508957950689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139637435082474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08129363055112591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858365640633821,0.0,0.08205814309683407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06078088973584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07973405875653282,0.08634511968024347,0.0,0.0,0.25773447603522204,0.0,0.07791163936560708,0.0,0.05884021218695167,0.0,0.0,0.054098158012424416,0.0,0.0,0.19169887071486252,0.0,0.15980426524430955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057466496818413336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874053525226724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0606775675801773,0.04456745068592456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06130822782602721,0.0,0.06872052455236569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07367662420910266,0.0,0.16692773501646616,0.07761925112264029,0.0,0.10858858391878738,0.0,0.0,0.0492189696998768

alcoholism,spoilingattack,2019/04/03,"Help me to help my patients... If you are an alcoholic, can you help me understand the role anxiety plays in your life and your drinking?

Critical care registered nurse here.  I take care of patients in a high level ICU, taking care of patients coming straight from open heart surgery.   A great many of my cardiac patients also have substance abuse issues, and drinking is a big one.  I have noticed that severe anxiety seems to be common theme for many of my patients who are alcoholics.

I want to better understand what my patients are going thru so that I can help them.  We have Ativan to help as they withdraw, but I want to be able to help my patients at a deeper level.  Not just throw drugs at them.

alcoholism,xxxSLEEPWALK,2019/04/03,"What did alcohol take from you? Money. Car. My ex. Lots of my friends. My car. My ability to drive. I dropped out of school twice, been to jail twice. And did a lot of stupid shit in between for the sake of getting drunk. Got nothing now but debt. All in the span of my 4 years of severe drinking. I played around with it in high school but it didn’t get bad until 19.
I was ready to move out on my own but my mistakes postponed all of that and I’m still at my parents house.

Working on my mistakes now (kinda.) I still drink a lot but I’m just glad the bad days are over. I still have a long way to go.

alcoholism,deathcabforbooty69,2019/04/03,"I’m an alcoholic and today is my first day sober. My alcohol abuse has ramped up recently. I used to just binge too much, maybe a bit too often. Now, every few weeks I go out and get absolutely wasted, and spend hundreds of dollars on drugs and hotel rooms. 

I’m not a daily drinker, and there are times (if I’m with my girlfriend, or at home alone) where I can have a drink or two and stop. If those aren’t the situation I’m in, I’m going to drink all I can. It’s taking a huge financial and emotional toll on me and is ruining my life.

Today is the day it all changes. Aside from AA, which I’ve tried and didn’t especially enjoy, but will try again, does anyone have suggestions for how I can fix this problem? I find I have a hard time not being so mad at myself that I can’t feel confident or okay.",2.9466962524654825,3.738959088757397,4.6350443786982245,86.91556459566078,73.49704142011834,8.236883629191325,24.142504930966467,8.59863814320734,1.3156504930966473,622,17,141,11,12,211,114,169,0.117,0.8109999999999999,0.07200000000000001,-0.8206,1,1,6,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,0,1,10,5,1,0,8,1,16,6,0,2,2,29,27,17,0,3,9,0,2,0,1,1,4,0,2,0,6,11,4,1,2,3,2,2,5,3,1,2,1,2,14,2,13,24,5,24,0,1,0,0,2,10,0,6,12,90,20,0,0.0,0.1868042374083413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33698644929828026,0.0,0.1632907630783891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11024125991138968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1721265752932346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16678598047716142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20335849099184036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13797148377347426,0.0,0.0,0.30889838187821506,0.18283840247279268,0.0,0.0,0.1773490500022639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328374249398274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07971887848139117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14410063481628835,0.13410761042133848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08237212959966296,0.0,0.17920642202530726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14123459871627692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581483053243524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11136166019626237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15839313528260338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11590005112470765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15086168423765556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15567266159630508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17721921412494096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318128786623171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854255078332085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838685000379749,0.0,0.2988911597282829,0.0,0.0,0.21408492617919156,0.0,0.15401331702497995,0.0,0.0,0.13616974680964886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12646731770455769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,pubgcommando,2019/04/03,"Is my tolerance normal? I've been struggling with alcohol addiction since I was 14. At first, it only took a few nips to get me shit-faced, but by 16 I started having to face entire pints of vodka before I got where I wanted to be. Sometimes a pint wouldn't even work. It got to the point where I couldn't drink with other people because if I shared any of it, I myself wouldn't get drunk. Nowadays, it takes a pint and a few shots to get me faded. Is this normal? Does anyone else have this Andre the Giant-esque tolerance?",3.3051635514018685,4.5173331028037405,4.624380841121496,85.7304030373832,73.11214953271029,6.845327102803737,21.786214953271028,7.1686216300943375,0.6696177570093464,410,9,82,4,8,136,73,107,0.019,0.872,0.109,0.8269,0,0,3,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,2,3,2,0,1,6,0,10,5,1,0,0,11,19,3,0,7,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,7,3,3,0,0,3,0,1,3,1,0,1,5,0,11,1,11,10,2,8,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,3,54,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21055652073344885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2064132280737406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13134519918343332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350514501257266,0.1978998410974176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177393777424397,0.0,0.16435213911628846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1690224601440784,0.0,0.0,0.18920853429866036,0.0,0.0,0.16134783414254072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12757042755620618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16428900826111265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.302730816791838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30895134471401403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784821135914464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14689544905995233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13390239926761968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18258442156172086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19826053064305704,0.1597715106615019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19102530874045187,0.0,0.13670900008926112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20191705331751986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14522097622757707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2145911624484004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392190436264407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406118346088923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,rdei,2019/04/03,"Feeling helpless My father was always a drinker, but in the last few years really turned the worse for him. Due to a related ""hobby"" he started to drink really strong drinks. Because of a car accident he lost his job and with his expertise he could't find any decent ones. My mother told him that he doesn't need to work (she had a decent salary), but with the agreement that he will stop drinking. As expected he didn't stop. Our money was kept away from him, but that didn't stop him. He started to sell my mother's jewelry just to get his daily dose of alcohol. After 30 years of marriage my mother sent him on his way. The divorce got him a good amount of money, so the last 3 months was the worst for him. With noone to watch over him, he started drinking immensly. His liver is about to give up. He's all skinny with a water filled belly and legs, making him almost unable to walk. He still believes up to this day that he can stop. We tried every possible way to force him to the hospital, but the procedure would take weeks, making him unable to drink so he decided that he would rather die like this. Our laws prevent us from forcing him to a ward. We spent so much time on convincing him, but we are all out of options.

Currently I'm living my life knowing that the call could come any time that he met his end.


 I'm about to visit him tomorrow. I don't want him to die. I don't want him to die without trying to convice him.

alcoholism,LittleDarkBuck,2019/04/03,"A Young Drinker Looking for some Answers Good afternoon,

My name is, well, T. I am an alcoholic at 27 years of age. I have been drinking for roughly a year straight, daily (6-10) drinks a day. I have two parents who struggle with alcoholism. My father is 60 and has been sober nearly 2 years for the first time since the the early 00s. My mother still drinks 8 or so shots a night and is agoraphobic.

My other issue is that I have been an opiod addict  for 8 years. I have been on Mdone for over 2 years (I go through a clinic) and have maintained my sobriety off of street drugs. Unfortunately, I lost a job, drank my issues away at a gas station afterwards, and received a DUI that afternoon around 5pm. I am currently on probation and still drinking. I only receive random drug tests through the clinic. 

My main concern is seizures if I quit drinking cold turkey, but I am fortunately perscribed 3mgs of Clonazepam a day for my anxiety.

I have been so concerned about this lately. What are my chances of experiencing severe withdrawl if I quit drinking cold turkey while taking my normal 3mg of clonazepam a day? I understand with the booze, Ive been hitting my gaba receptors extra hard. 

My main question is - Can I quit cold turkey with my normal dose of clonazepam as a crutch? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel trapped. Thanks so much, guys.

alcoholism,lundezx,2019/04/04,"My gut always turns to alcohol. For the past few months I’ve realized that whenever im upset or very angry I turn to alcohol to numb the feeling I feel in my heart.  I’m diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and i tend to feel more than the average person. So whenever I felt a very strong emotion like sadness I go straight to alcohol.  I don’t have anyone to turn to whenever it comes to wanting to vent. I don’t know what to do. My family are all alcoholics so I can’t go to them. Reddit, what can I do to avoid turning to alcohol whenever I’m upset ? I feel guilty afterwards when I’m drunk and it upsets me even more. I don’t want to be like this anymore.

alcoholism,MrTheFalcon,2019/04/04,"Weekend encouragement I'm about a month sober. Three weeks before that with one night where I slipped-up. I'm heading into a weekend where I have to work alone most of the weekend. At some point I'm going to a low key birthday party, but we will be going to a video game bar. 

I have a lot of pressure from work and family, and it's been tough to catch a break. I'm reaching the point where I feel like I'm doing pretty good, which means I'm definitely overestimating myself.

Any advice for preempting urges to drink when alone, or at the party?

I'm already thinking of skipping the bar, and just do board games earlier.",3.420080645161292,5.095438266129033,4.471806451612904,85.08770967741938,73.59677419354837,6.895483870967742,25.30322580645161,7.554174236665415,1.2237638709677419,491,16,98,6,10,160,80,124,0.08,0.727,0.193,0.9464,0,2,1,0,0,0,14.0,1,0,0,2,6,6,0,1,10,0,7,4,1,0,0,15,19,6,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,6,3,0,3,9,0,3,0,3,0,2,1,1,6,3,15,16,3,20,0,1,0,0,4,9,0,4,8,56,9,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19457750238098168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4124559921314858,0.2197335811035805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13540824920396674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694362302468562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1950615364939947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877123667538219,0.0,0.10068092185920824,0.14225117983287242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22632867040157825,0.1670121881462571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2043542961127987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09727984552669808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16928447972975902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21689976744363035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15893547428663327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18686038434698246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13492868698795926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3764650251291407,0.0,0.0,0.2025763572727382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12758788730787451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15972184222998656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2899230799468668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Opposite_Guitar,2019/04/04,"Recording alcohol consumption About a year ago I decided to start recording my alcohol consumption as I was bit concerned and wanted to start tracking some life data. After a year of careful recording I decided to share a chart.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g0psffm34bq21.jpg

Some explanation is necessary - unit is a 500 ml of 5% beer (my most common drink). If I drank anything else I converted it to this unit. Red bars are weekly total of these units, green line is 4 weeks total. I also have a daily break down, but that's too detailed and wide for displaying here.

It's pretty mind blowing to see how I drank equivalent of 58 tall beers in one week (and 141 in one month) without really feeling like a (""real"") alcoholic. Last year was quite unique for me - I was mostly unemployed, did a lot of travelling and celebrations/parties (some important life events) which kind of explains the amounts consumed. For this (and following) years I plan to reduce the amount to 1/3 of 2018 numbers or less.

In general I can recommend recording the consumption - it is pretty revealing since human memory is very forgetful. It also kind of holds me accountable - I have to record every single beer and there's a bit of gamification factor which sways me a bit on rather not drinking that one beer on the weekday nights.",7.484487179487179,8.661394713675218,7.135025641025642,71.6933076923077,63.4017094017094,10.855384615384617,34.83076923076923,10.793553405168565,4.098576410256411,1049,45,169,27,15,330,145,234,0.035,0.889,0.075,0.8404,2,0,9,0,0,0,44.0,0,0,0,2,8,5,0,0,13,0,13,14,0,1,2,32,23,13,0,3,6,0,1,1,0,0,5,0,0,1,11,6,12,1,5,8,1,2,2,0,0,3,6,4,16,5,30,17,15,27,0,0,3,0,3,8,0,8,17,113,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10200464846191,0.3689318701738601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840465490995833,0.0,0.12468078601189013,0.1398254364697632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469469585542603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3768874354549832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11732387623010125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22545408568072986,0.0,0.0,0.09612813861174263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695337347477212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058184011033768364,0.08220767215994089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396601796023816,0.0,0.09379928076737416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16255793330335416,0.056218511918313466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783035211194972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161902168149346,0.0,0.09184960982461353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079875557737024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23392790016735265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341397911159391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223935526723001,0.0,0.13097746682158254,0.07371826022369131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0916977224610963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951889934234138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16289752855862275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949466965910034,0.06787262234838136,0.0,0.2769121674403915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11092558820070036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398254364697632,0.29641114658544576

alcoholism,PinkertonMalinkerton,2019/04/04,"I never understood the stigma against chasers. For me it allows me to drink so much more, especially since my drink of choice is vodka.

I don't necessarily need it, but it makes drinking so much easier.

alcoholism,styball,2019/04/04,"Hospital/rehab I'm working on being completely financially independent from an abusive household. I'm mostly there but medical insurance is still with my parents for now.

I've been to a mental hospital before, but I feel i need to go to rehab for drinking.

Telling them I need to go to a mental hospital is already bad enough (trust me I've tried to tell them I need help for years), so telling them I need to go to rehab would be impossible, they have no idea about my substance abuse.

I was thinking of just checking myself into a mental hospital without my mom's knowledge, and explaining later, minus the substance abuse issues.

But I'mm at the point of I've tried everything, I can't get better on my own, and I'm scared I'll die from the withdrawals. I don't know what to do. 

So I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on this

alcoholism,belyyrusskiy,2019/04/04,"I wake up everyday feeling terrible and decide to stop drinking. I desperately need to, but you all know... the day happens and you just want a drink. You’re fine with a few then it seems to always get out of control. I have several mental illnesses which contribute to my alcoholism, and it of course contributes to them. I joke about how pathetic I am, but I truly do believe it. It’s almost like I feel I don’t deserve to be sober... like it’s something lovely I’m too awful to appreciate. I just want to relax, and I end up feeling bad about it anyway. I pretty much only drink alone but have recently been dissociating and making, of course, bad decisions. I’ve never been a blackout drunk, but I can officially say I have gotten out of control with it. There isn’t really anyone in my life that understands, I live alone and my parents live in a different country. I talk to people all day for work but never connect with anyone. I’m too disengaged for actual AA meetings; I’ve tried. Without alcohol, I usually turn to self-harm or various other things that are questionably worse. I don’t know anymore. Any input is appreciated. Thanks, I just joined this sub.

alcoholism,Crabman25,2019/04/05,"I need help hello everybody, as the title says I need help. I've been drinking since I was 18 (28 now) and it's become a problem. I drink about a half pint of liquor every night and I want to stop so badly the problem is I don't know how to stop. I've been reading some books that try to help and they all say the same things about how alcohol is bad for your body and brain to try to get you to subconsciously dislike alcohol, but I still drink. every day. I can't remember the last time I went 24 hours without alcohol. One of my biggest problems is that a lot of information I get talks a lot about social drinking, but I mainly drink at home by myself, and I maintain a job. idk if anyone can relate and honestly idk what I'm trying to achieve with this post, but I'm alone and need some feedback.

alcoholism,whattodo1999,2019/04/05,"Just a helpless rant Honestly I probably have a problem. Every time I drink I know that it does nothing but make my life that little bit shorter, I know I’m drinking too much but I don’t care. I think about any situation. I think about birthdays and Christmases and parties and maybe even my own wedding someday and they all involve booze. 

“Bad situation? Have a drink to help you through!” 

“Good situation? Have a drink to celebrate!” 

How do I get into my head that I can have fun without drinking? Or get through a tough time? Cause honestly right now, the thought of me not drinking kinda terrifies me. 

What if I’m boring? What if I hate even going out to social events without it and become a recluse? What if I need to escape for a bit? Or be happy on command (like a family gathering)? 

I know in my head that I need to stop drinking but in my heart I’m just too invested if that makes sense. 

Thanks for sorting by new. 

Sorry for the rant.

alcoholism,EnlightenMePixie,2019/04/05,Medicine to help stop drinking? I tend to binge drink a few times a week. I want to see about getting some medicine to help the cravings or stop the effects. I’m worried about calling my regular doctor though and making an appointment. They (receptionist) always ask what I want to be seen for and I don’t want to say for help to stop drinking. Any suggestions or information is appreciated thanks. Taking this step is scary for me since it would be admitting outside of myself that there is an issue. ,4.537659574468087,6.764323776595745,4.8095212765957465,81.50875,71.87234042553192,7.67872340425532,29.835106382978722,8.472884824447931,2.336727659574468,401,17,73,7,8,126,65,94,0.116,0.7070000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.6369,0,0,3,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,1,1,4,1,0,0,6,0,7,4,0,2,0,16,20,5,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,4,2,3,3,3,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,8,1,13,16,2,6,0,0,2,0,10,0,0,3,5,46,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14089200657225825,0.0,0.0,0.11514684091442662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15829606525098067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1728998084928964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733113643609081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4976222610492106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08846535038391905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34048503689955306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1767313609552918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11302578620719893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13465407656749676,0.0,0.0,0.13493014286072855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1400674317384417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42468997290641625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12731136540256335,0.0,0.0,0.15589175719396314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16636100265311662,0.0,0.09873479876919218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2996169059820906,0.0,0.13582234218324596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17195780827171395,0.0,0.12028365788082986,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,radicallyrandom,2019/04/05,"I need advice Hey guys! I just turned 21 and I'm honestly scared. I've been drinking non stop since my birthday. I started drinking when I was 16 and it's always been a problem for me. When I turned 18 I started using drugs pretty bad, and I was able to pull myself out of that, but alcohol has been so hard for me. I have always felt like it was a lot more acceptable and ""healthier"" for me to get drunk then to use, but in all honesty I know that alcohol is a drug just like anything else. I realized I had a problem last year and stopped drinking for about 8 months, but I started up again. Now that I'm 21 I want to experience going out, but I just seem to go too crazy every time. All my friends and co workers drink so heavily too, which makes it so much harder to control myself, because drinking seems to be the ""norm"". I would like to be able to have a drink here and there without it being a big deal, but I can't have just one drink. Once I start drinking all I can think about is that next drink, and I will go and go and go. I lose all of my judgement. I don't like who I become when I'm drinking, but at the same time I still want to go out and have ""fun"". Is it possible to find a healthy balance?",2.432107311079257,3.357727762645915,3.826897399139874,91.7174626254352,74.87548638132296,6.811304525906206,25.977677657177964,7.0608816371341465,0.9308412451361868,933,32,216,9,19,308,131,257,0.099,0.763,0.138,0.9018,0,0,14,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,3,19,13,0,1,9,0,23,15,0,4,4,51,50,24,0,6,11,0,2,4,1,2,4,0,0,1,11,14,13,3,8,11,0,7,3,5,0,1,8,2,31,8,26,37,8,33,0,1,0,0,5,7,0,3,23,144,42,1,0.14738996785237338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07201388537897771,0.0,0.15751505148269726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12264026041732383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06064469255167625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061532233336830826,0.04492377818929249,0.08139031982563995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08265519088489308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597629249201326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7219302827426365,0.17092556949092158,0.0,0.061562702736533574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062091202396406336,0.0,0.0,0.0720878352385339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07075874148588847,0.0,0.06735588021133185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05693656177306015,0.0,0.03850258745314047,0.0,0.2512953460009376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07296962039579269,0.0,0.0,0.06601623042783275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0405008358755024,0.06007124783832143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14401458667564895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244583656656368,0.0,0.06265283997647969,0.0,0.0,0.049191974021658175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058822633078724186,0.0,0.05417429263927598,0.054643896795516726,0.0,0.0,0.07837545145686396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07848275273730088,0.04993762834955881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308002150196975,0.0,0.07497429247789385,0.0,0.14103229378476972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07378153510400419,0.0,0.0,0.13417829115274366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06096125224669261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20864675571582225,0.0,0.05885290935914422,0.12322461281046747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047220770026870584,0.0,0.0,0.08594427553344276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16031796092867107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12729760928827438,0.0,0.0,0.08693442178171934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07103933469320985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05235080216877918,0.0,0.0,0.04745715346350675
alcoholism,Lilredhead3,2019/04/05,"Would appreciate your thoughts on this! 
I’m 20 I’ve been struggling with alcoholism for almost 4 years now. In the past year I’ve become real close with this girl we’ll call her sophia. I guess were best friends but lately I don’t care for her much. To me everything’s always about her and she just has to have all the attention. Anyways I’ll get to the point, Im trying to get sober now because I’m tired of ruining my life and all of a sudden sophia decides she’s going to get sober as well. She post on fb about struggling with alcoholism when really that just isn’t true. I’ll agree lately she’s drank more than she should but she has no idea what it’s like to really struggle with this. I get so triggered every time she makes a post about this and I know I should just focus on myself but it’s frustrating. I guess I’m just venting but I would appreciate comments of your thoughts on this !

alcoholism,helloooo222,2019/04/06,"Found out my dad is an alcoholic two days ago (using a throwaway) Hi everyone, I'm really new to all of this. Because of a misdirected text, I accidentally found out that my dad is an alcoholic. Apparently he went to rehab when I was a toddler but I didn't know because I was too young. Throughout my entire life (I'm 19) I never once saw him drink because he told me he was sworn off it. A few months ago he relapsed, and neither he nor my mom told me because I went abroad this semester and they didn't want to ""ruin my trip."" I already discussed all that with them and think by now they know they made a mistake in doing that. The reason I'm writing here is because this is all so sudden and confusing for me, and I don't really know where to start with processing my thoughts. 

I think, keeping in mind the way I usually deal with problems, I'd like to remain as positive as possible and be as strong of a support for my dad as I can be. I'm planning on texting him more often just to remind him I love him and things like that. Are there any other things that I can do to help from abroad? Are there any things I should be doing for myself right now? This whole thing has been really jarring and I feel like the reality of it hasn't hit me yet.

Thank you for any help! :)",3.676848331220953,4.396917878326998,5.093884664131814,84.56593895226024,71.73764258555133,8.277904520490072,27.538867765103504,8.515128840125781,1.7735671313899442,994,34,213,16,18,334,137,263,0.045,0.7829999999999999,0.172,0.9907,1,0,3,0,1,0,27.0,0,1,4,2,12,11,0,1,11,0,24,6,0,3,4,40,51,16,0,4,2,4,1,3,0,1,4,0,0,0,16,13,3,1,10,1,0,3,7,4,0,1,15,2,36,7,30,31,7,26,0,1,1,1,27,8,0,2,17,148,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20006720343168116,0.2412019734246601,0.0,0.0,0.1245313939998536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2302230448494899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3439577313708124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07277810345494977,0.11634209880302028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11054880611944234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10783180990910014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05705971515754464,0.08061916450704408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24746564383306266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15128026729116753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030514781466976,0.0,0.0,0.1860561536163904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079708404474773,0.16539658677595825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10185039641554752,0.10678020914154417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139450608124246,0.13216708384094913,0.09007478997765178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703590746231529,0.10899001913980852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12018022825022576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12722000183353624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10798100644124672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21688138316034972,0.11602730267746073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963722098786485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07987492108466462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12805941617411765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10389596079555424,0.0,0.0,0.2998867617260716,0.1446178356912688,0.0,0.08958929657018955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2156636198182003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102368242920697,0.0,0.0,0.0974650812209713,0.12428694720189247,0.0,0.06656111239815657,0.08957407947189044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20922383058350405,0.0,0.12599159143541427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is a throwaway account. It's hard for me to say 'yeah I'm an alcoholic' because it doesn't affect my day job. I drink pretty much whenever I'm not working. I can't remember the last day I haven't at least gotten a heavy buzz. On my days off I wake up happy that I don't have to work, and immediately start drinking. Like if I don't really have anything to do that day, 9am is a good time to start drinking. If I have a few errands to run I do them as soon as I wake up and then have the rest of the day to drink. It's consumed my life but I don't know how to stop. I will literally get blackout drunk by noon on my days off and nap until I feel better. And wake up and drink again. I feel like I'm getting to the point that I bet help but am not ready to deal with reality right now.

alcoholism,Alcohol__Throwaway,2019/04/06,"Went for a good 120 days sober, then relapsed because I ""thought I could handle it"" I am having major regrets. I've had problems with my family and my alcoholism before, they have always (rightfully) spoken against it, and as most alcoholics do, I rebelled. Like a teenager, but in this case im a 30 year old with outstanding debt who lives at home with parents to try to pay it off. Here I am, tossing liquor when I told myself I wouldnt. I bought a 1.75L handle there a few days ago and stupidly made the promise to myself that i'd go moderately on it. We all know that's never the case, I knew that when I did it. I felt depressed at the time and I slipped up. 

I drank the last 4 nights with 2 1.75l handles I'm finishing the last of it and I feel just total absolute regret. My family comes to visit soon, and I know they will look at me with regret thinking ""Oh he has liquor on his breath, back to his old self I see"" I think that part of the problem with the alcoholic down-ward spiral is the judge-mentality that is associated with it. People assume the worst, but that's to be expected from family members. There is really no way out of it. I am turning back to Marijuana because it does not inebriate me like alcohol does, nor does it kill my organs systematically. I was able to get out of my depths last time using it and I will do so again. Anyway, thanks for listening.

alcoholism,AModelofHealth,2019/04/06,"Pancreatitis scare 27 year old male here. I was in the hospital for acute pancreatitis a few months ago. I was able to stay off the sauce for about a month before I was back to drinking heavy again. I'm at work now and starting to feel that same pain. I'm scared it's reared it's ugly head again. I can't afford to go back to the hospital for financial reasons, and the fact that I'll probably end up losing my job if I do. I've really gotta do something about my drinking I just can't get it through my thick skull.

Does anyone here have any experience with pancreatitis? Is it possible for me to sit through this and make it through an attack without a hospital visit?",3.121579296615792,4.699199671532848,4.4263968148639705,85.51042468480428,74.18248175182481,8.193497013934971,26.323158593231586,8.841846274778883,1.8626554744525543,533,19,113,11,11,176,88,137,0.142,0.858,0.0,-0.9569,2,0,3,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,2,10,5,1,2,8,0,9,5,2,2,1,12,17,4,0,1,3,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,8,4,2,0,2,2,0,2,3,5,0,0,3,2,10,0,21,13,2,21,0,1,0,0,2,5,0,1,12,70,18,2,0.16939720242851933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15016039911055135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11519590652898072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11844646261915875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19271377273659712,0.0,0.2605119848044971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14414454257317078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14824063339279991,0.0,0.0,0.3318895363828885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15003564159818425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16570296874976947,0.0,0.0,0.0856523153642932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08850304665720679,0.0,0.0962723339001894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17385040078574462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16810058499317426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18951213939124173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307394801187087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27042246166972633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.177753868272139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18025056677474768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19096989334078726,0.0,0.0,0.18263883510813125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10852018553898064,0.17416853716074202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3391923024236862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041024242799767,0.0,0.0,0.11990021176152198,0.18055487877383172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16329285818782716,0.0,0.12332318087890574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090862444585235

alcoholism,meltdown248,2019/04/06,"I've relapsed after almost two years, and it's continued for a while. I wish I had the courage to tell my family, but they spent a lot of money to get me help that I feel so much shame about it. I made it almost two years before relapsing.. but now.. 

I've managed to go a few days sober without meetings and support, but always find a reason to relapse yet again to *deal with feelings*.. 

I don't think I can bring myself to tell my family, but I do genuinely want to stop, I just don't want to drag them along with the ""sober one week relapsed next"" until I can manage myself. 

I guess I just need to know that other people have dealt with the feelings of hiding a secret and letting people down, without them knowing, but then managed to get out of it. 

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety which obviously doesn't help the situation at all, and have dealt with it (poorly) for a few years.

TL;DR: two years after my family got me clean, been lying ever since trying to solve my issues without involving hem again.

alcoholism,orangeinthehead,2019/04/06,"Do alcoholic drinks “taste better” to true alcoholics and people with a genetic predisposition to alcoholism? I know alcoholism runs in my family, and I seem to like the taste of say a vodka OJ better than regular OJ.

alcoholism,PhilupMcCrack,2019/04/07,"7 days - concerned about staying this way I am in the middle of a divorce, and realizing that alcohol has been a huge reason for my failed relationship, and that I need to get healthy and get my mind straight, Ive decided to take a break.  I fantasize about leaving it for good, and know that's what needs to happen, but I have a lot of doubt.  This week has been hard, it seems like the last 20 years are in my face more than ever, flashing before my eyes and seeing all the stuff I wrecked in my life because of alcohol very clearly.

I tried to quit in the past, even made it over a hundred days in 2012, until a date told me I was a fucking pussy and to take a drink.  That was that.  Problem is, those 100+ days were the loneliest, most miserable days of my entire life.  I was scared to live my life.  I mostly stayed in.  I also had a ton of anger, and exploded on family members regularly which I had trouble understanding\[even now\].

These last seven days, I have really done next to nothing.  I work from home so its  even more isolating.  I feel like I can only fill my days with  work, reddit, yard work, gym so much before i need to do something social.

alcoholism,teecupsy,2019/04/07,"why i keep drinking so i have been thinking a lot about why i enjoy drinking so much. recently i came to the conclusion that it is simply because i feel so fucking bored when i’m sober. i know the saying “if you are bored it’s because you are boring”. but i genuinely think every day life is so god damn boring it’s insane. nothing really gets me excited for more than a couple of minutes i.e meeting a person/going to an event. 

if i have a couple of drinks everything is fun, new and exciting. i also start to feel so happy and relaxed like nothing can touch me. does anybody relate to this on here",1.984559228650138,4.2011985785124,4.043326446280993,84.03347451790638,79.74380165289256,6.347382920110194,24.959366391184567,7.492282038375204,1.4815944903581264,472,18,88,7,12,161,81,121,0.114,0.6509999999999999,0.235,0.9671,0,0,3,0,0,0,10.0,0,2,0,1,9,13,2,0,7,0,9,5,0,0,0,14,20,12,0,2,3,0,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,5,3,3,1,6,4,0,1,0,6,0,0,2,4,13,7,10,18,3,8,0,0,0,1,4,1,2,3,7,60,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12778824225539254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19481946125914976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18276325121237827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35362091625418945,0.0,0.10305474781776597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398379423152672,0.0,0.0,0.4696156726554298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346344306664295,0.0,0.14361371038129814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16159460818470645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14772817829877288,0.08348644801309242,0.0,0.0908153504634493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17010506633842992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14203340320984273,0.0,0.0,0.08781931689453579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11286814484234195,0.07806791113880635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13585224821409586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746793047556772,0.0,0.0,0.15433129476998686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066557966933736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395270908151535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023689598332432,0.0,0.1577785791454496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12707563485948484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11310393454316142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20478074969815935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28838080415267797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,42497,2019/04/07,"What distracts you from drinking? I always find distracting myself from the thought of drinking so difficult. I currently don't work due to health problems, have a grand total of 0 friends or family to talk to, and extreme agoraphobia along side bpd and ptsd. Any journey further than the liqour store below my apartment is unbearable. The alcoholism is getting in the way of treatment for my mental health issues and I've even started to let my physical health slide. I feel so trapped and terrified to quit. The thought of having a seizure and ending up in hospital is an unbearable thought, that alone makes me want to drink to forget.

I do the usual things, housework, TV, reading. I just find hobbies that I enjoy and can afford to do, extremely hard to find? I get so frustrated at myself for not enjoying anything more than being slumped in a chair with a can of beer watching the same TV show I've watched a million times... Sorry for the ramble, first sober thoughts in over a week. Just hoping I can keep it up for a change.

alcoholism,KatTheFat,2019/04/07,"Last night I trapped my cat in my room I found out yesterday that an old friend had killed herself and I didn't cope with it well, I just drank myself into oblivion. I ended up passing out but before that at some point I'd let my cat into my room and closed the door, planning to let him out when he wanted to. Well I passed out before I got the chance to let him out, and came round about 5 hours later and he was frantically scratching and meowing at the door to get out, and even then it took me a good 10 minutes or so to realise what was going on. I feel so guilty, he must have been so scared and was probably desperate for the toilet. I guess I'm overreacting but I love my cat and I feel like it just adds to the evidence that I'm a bad person who can't take responsibility for their actions.

alcoholism,nhanonymousadvice,2019/04/07,"Day One So today is day one of my husband getting sober. He’s a Marine and has been drinking for 20 years, heavily in the past 10, and most heavily in the past 4-5 months. He’s 39 and I’m 29. We have a 9 year old, who is my stepson. It finally got to a point that I was able to bring him to the ER yesterday afternoon to start the journey of getting clean and detoxing. I am super proud of him. His liver is enlarged, assumption is because of years of abuse, but as he gets clean they assume it will go back to normal. His nutrients were all fucked up, of course due to the abuse, so they threw him on an IV and Ativan, and honestly it was amazing how much better he looked in a matter of a few hours. 

They gave us some medication for him to take through the detox. We are at home now, the Ativan just wore off so he took his first pill of the other stuff. I’m up just making sure he can (somewhat) comfortably go back to sleep. My mom and my stepsons mom went to the hospital with us in show of support. My mom came by our house before she went home to take all alcohol/reminders of alcohol away. Thanks mom.☺️ I had a break down in the parking lot from the stress of everything, called her and she was by my side in 5 minutes. I know I need a support system, too, while going through this and I don’t have words to express my gratefulness in her being that for me. 

I’m lucky, he was never was abusive or angry as a drunk, but used it to numb or ignore his demons from being in the service. Going forward, we have contacted a few local resources because now he’s going to have to face his PTSD and start working through this stuff. That is where I’m mostly worried, I know he was dealt a dirty hand in what he had to do, and those scars are extremely deep. 

I don’t really know the purpose of this post, it’s 3am and I’m sandwiched between him and my dog snoring while I watch a random TV movie. I guess the biggest thing is I’m just so proud of him. He needs to be here for me, our son, even our dog. And the fact that he’s finally at this point, I’m truly grateful and even excited. The weight that has been on my shoulders as well has been extremely heavy, and I feel a lot of it has been lifted with this first step. I know going through the next couple of weeks is going to be tough, I don’t know what to expect. But I hope we’re on the upswing, even though I know there are going to be some shitty days ahead. Meetings are going to be a daily thing for awhile, or permanently, luckily we have them close by and easily accessible. Other than substance abuse counseling and meetings, are there are other things I/we can do? What helps? I’ve dealt with opiate addicts, but never alcohol personally. We live in NH, and this isn’t an easy place considering we have like the highest drinking per capita or something like that. Finding sober activities, sober friends, won’t be easy.

alcoholism,Victoria-Wayne,2019/04/07,"My dad is in his first severe detox in years, hallucinations. Last week, after serveral weeks of non stop drinking, he threw up blood and then started to stop because he was feeling sick, nausea, vomiting, headaches, he got easily confused and throughout the week he kept talking to someone that wasnt there and kept hearing things. Paranoia. People calling him. 

Today, I woke up to hear a mirror break (later on I learn its from him trying to jump out a window), yelling, my dad is the living room and my mom trying to get him to not go outside. He says there are people with guns and that they are gonna kill him.  And hes pointing. Shaking. They have guns and they are gonna kill him and we have to be quiet. 

We call my uncle, they take him to emergency. They put him on sedatives and then let him go. No medication nothing. Saying its a withdrawl symptom. He thinks my grandpa is here and other people. He had about 3 or 4 more moments of hallucinations and he was violent sometimes.

we went to a bbq and he cried a bit twice, and had  two more episodes but were minor in comparason. everyone there knew what happened.

We gave him a little bit of his drink, because its the first time and we dont know if he can handle it.

I want to know how long this will last, he has at times controlled his drinking to be ""normal"" but this is the worst and first time I could say hes actually detoxing in all my life and he has been drinking since before he was my dad.

Do any of you have any idea how long this will last? Have any of you been through this? Did you realize it was a hallucination after withdrawl? Tomorrow is Sunday and the liquor stores are closed, I feel like its gonna get worse. Please help.",3.059324755532681,4.999346928358211,3.779650025733404,88.53925373134331,75.23880597014927,6.172928461142563,24.984559958826562,6.953978226594392,0.9238214101904272,1331,45,269,13,29,422,178,335,0.103,0.855,0.041,-0.9531,0,0,4,2,1,0,43.0,5,3,5,4,7,7,3,2,12,0,37,13,1,3,1,51,63,25,2,4,5,5,2,1,0,5,7,7,2,0,15,25,5,5,9,5,1,7,4,6,0,5,19,9,39,1,32,35,6,49,0,0,0,0,55,14,0,3,28,173,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.09016233471489513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18849142256923568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11264394862322595,0.0,0.07861972039308343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2017386644360861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188687364215196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10362671452353484,0.07376836978398317,0.0,0.10148947850462756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10828402146486857,0.3620402421904722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828556351198275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09343345179430068,0.0660056468899996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2357685630852653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654315949691328,0.0,0.10501825234181623,0.0,0.0738951998650185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817029104602699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082674702755367,0.0,0.061929145292575524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430056027942272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20443854509859616,0.0,0.10155365954160074,0.2259381165600328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09447820140927367,0.06525997673254769,0.04513860019222932,0.09260215563635768,0.08158479728718612,0.16352996663957722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307632488508076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820967842856302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052561805504884,0.08865366833602327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19216122005448136,0.0,0.0,0.1014198752754972,0.08734134066340674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09288058153420077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2204240971388584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10437790085327664,0.0,0.07642852452379749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07828437118073843,0.0,0.0913791353244902,0.0,0.0653963095340724,0.0,0.0,0.15448953220332215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09603180436934176,0.06946811040983401,0.07426207150399157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0613818681405059,0.05920176582703127,0.0,0.0,0.16162547343285866,0.0,0.08757785262475196,0.0,0.0,0.12545769591276393,0.0,0.09025463043420058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054495842377210765,0.0,0.22233650781467484,0.0,0.0,0.08564932647783287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09415645910936786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05949812518019641

alcoholism,PSMF_Canuck,2019/04/08,"Set the Final Frontier, Received as Ultimatum with Predictable Outcome After a series of failed attempts at ""tapering"", finally sat Q down and put it plainly:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I can't be in an intimate relationship any longer with an active alcoholic. It's not healthy for me.""

&amp;#x200B;

Results were, I guess, predictable. 

\&gt; ""I can quit anytime I want to, I just don't want to."" 

\&gt; ""You're trying to change me, I can change, but I won't because you're asking me to.""

\&gt; ""I'm a steady drinker, nobody can tell when I'm drinking.""

\&gt; ""If you really loved me....""

&amp;#x200B;

Etc etc etc. From what I've read here, all pretty standard stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lots and lots of ""I'd have gotten there on my own, but you're being mean to me, therefore it's your fault"" in a myriad of phrasings. Followed by attempts at bargaining, offers made with no metrics or timelines or plan or anything. Absolute refusal to work with outside help (AA, outpatient, inpatient...any and all have been offered).

&amp;#x200B;

So we've broken up. To her friends, I'm being portrayed as the ""asshole"" who ""changed his mind"" despite ""he knew who I was all along"". I'm fine being the asshole, that doesn't affect me directly. What I'm not fine is living with someone pounding liquor along with a grab bag of personality disorder prescriptions.

&amp;#x200B;

Obladi oblada...it really sucks but I just don't see the point in investing more time into something that is, in its current configuration, absolutely doomed.

&amp;#x200B;

She moves out in a few days. I have every intention of being as good a friend as I can, but I don't think she's going to make it easy. And I've said that if she does find her own way to sobriety, I'm totally open to restarting Us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Love really isn't enough.

Got totally wasted and tried to kiss my bff ( known her all my life)  totally mortified my wife. I feel so guilty although I don't even remember. I would never even think of another woman if I'm sober. Don't really know what that was about. But my wife is growing tired me falling off the wagon. She drinks, but can handle it. Its hard for me sometimes to say no when there is always alcohol around. But I don't think she should change just because I can't handle my liquor. I just don't know what to do anymore.

alcoholism,bearsBscary,2019/04/08,"4 months sober, PAWS has been God awful for two months straight now. It's been a horrendous 4 days this week but am still continuing on not drinking. I feel like I can't make it anymore, that my nerves cant take it anymore, that my emotions are too out of whack, that the days are too different and scary and are just held on pause. 
But despite all this miserableness, I'm continuing to not drink today. 
I have to remind myself there is an end and im getting close before I can get on with my life again.
I still will take my worst day not drinking, than any day drinking.
Life is so much in my control and so much easier to achieve sober. 
If i go back to drinking, I lose so much.

alcoholism,HudsonBrownies,2019/04/08,I’m one year sober and I don’t have anyone to talk about it with. By 18 I was hopelessly addicted to alcohol and by 21 I was almost dead. I drank 1.75ltr of vodka a day just to be able to function. Miraculously I never got a DUI or hurt anyone even tho I drove drunk every day. I tried to stop on my own and had DT’s so bad I almost died. Spent a week in the hospital on the brink of death seizing and hallucinating. The past year has been a anxiety ridden journey but here I am one year sober and never looking back.

alcoholism,akstan92,2019/04/08,Think I’m an alcoholic??? So I’ve been drinking since 15 and drink pretty hard. I’m now 26 and have been known to black out and run across town shirtless. I often say horrible things and get angry. I cannot stop at just one beer. Any thoughts on what to do? Like quit for good maybe? I’m lost in this world and any advice would really mean a lot.

alcoholism,cknngt1204,2019/04/08,"Go to AA or not? Couple of years ago, had a little over 1.5 years sober. Started drinking again. Was ok at first but in the last month or so I’ve done some really stupid things and have been drinking a lot. After another night of excessive drinking, I went through the whole “wow, I should stop drinking” cycle. I’ve never been a fan of AA and I’m torn on if i should go back. I looked for IOP where I live and the 3-4 hours a few times a week just won’t work based on my work schedule and my husband’s. AA makes me nervous - I don’t like feeling on the spot, I hate fessing up as a newcomer, my anxiety is through the roof, and I usually jet out before anyone can approach. And I’ve had a sponsor before - wasn’t a fan. Nice people, but I just have a problem with someone telling me what to do (yes, i know, I know), and I really don’t like someone pushing god/religion/prayer on me. And if I quit drinking I feel left out or that life isn’t going to be fun - it’s everywhere. Work outings, outings with other moms, neighborhood gatherings. What’s worked for others?

alcoholism,larking94,2019/04/09,"Worried about loved one drinking Hey guys, 

I've an uncle who has pretty much reared me and I'm starting to get a bit worried about his drinking. He was an alcoholic for his whole married life and it cost him his wife and kids. Nowadays, he's nowhere near as bad and has totally mellowed out as he's 65. I've lived with him for past 3 years and he's been the best influence on my life and now he's like a father to me. However, he does drink pretty much every night still, but he'll only have 5-6 at the most. His drinking isn't harming anyone and it never really caused any issues for me, but I'm after moving away now and I'm really worried that he might fall into a rut and drink a crazy amount. I felt like when I was there he would moderate himself, but there have been times when I'm away that I know he's had far, far too many (I see the cans when I come back). He says that he only drinks now to just relax and take it easy, but I just don't buy that really. He has a stressful life and he's not really that open, so I get the feeling he's drinking just to escape from it. That and he's with someone who is a chronic alcoholic and is reinforcing the constant binging, so that's not easy.

Do you guys think that I should tell him that I'm worried about him? I don't want to seem like I'm trying to control him, because he is old enough to make his own choices, but it does cause a lot of stress for me worrying about him while I'm away.",3.881410865874365,3.7998200612903226,5.009286926994907,88.20866723259762,70.96774193548387,8.074702886247879,26.6383701188455,7.669130373188453,1.208838709677419,1129,32,259,12,19,374,150,310,0.08,0.795,0.125,0.9213,2,0,9,0,0,0,27.0,0,1,0,2,20,10,0,2,14,0,21,14,0,5,2,47,43,26,0,3,10,2,2,3,0,4,6,1,0,3,16,19,9,1,5,8,2,3,6,4,0,1,6,4,27,6,30,33,11,32,0,0,1,1,41,11,0,4,21,156,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17107079159249095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05442802141575013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055963851479683864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255926727068069,0.061543644714630474,0.06682769529832401,0.04878991705127269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08399407390328725,0.0,0.08737986216013824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16444044538506072,0.0,0.06894493653041042,0.0,0.08649174898989054,0.08976849387285597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1400821368067942,0.0,0.0,0.5488417052630555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269979375430922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06743476921663967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04046919891014971,0.0,0.07684823643287864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0836322377063932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584987670169801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08353801304942372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04398633646855543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1695978642687145,0.11730635792371387,0.0,0.07067428904859907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06804474130823876,0.07223667240956061,0.0,0.0534254336755032,0.08114512987461837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.084906791110704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08506684714944977,0.11767306093643035,0.0,0.061729601027496424,0.0,0.0,0.07510946386784034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08398554810291325,0.0,0.0542352589901484,0.1217437515343882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07640453687811641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628531552070647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2050954468966608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06364877147242286,0.0,0.0,0.06377926347724787,0.07286283522101708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678152359359273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05665072214929196,0.0,0.0639177887879234,0.0,0.1833646197596612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06017799244487083,0.0,0.06995601593458185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0512845879302594,0.0,0.0,0.046670318518621884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05433998587444268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0472079976194144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08935864402281224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4064081652997257,0.0,0.05685611046826668,0.0,0.0,0.05154131451761758
alcoholism,lgallagher4,2019/04/09,"Looking for help Hi friends, I am a long time lurker here and I feel I am in dire need of help.

Alcohol is evil, I know it is, we know it is.

I am 28 and I have an alcohol addiction, I hate it yet love it but I know I need it out my life, I have tried to cut it out but I do not have the willpower to do this on my own.

Next week my next chapter starts again after a rough few years, I finally have my own place and want to cut alcohol out my life, I hate tge feeling of not being in control of my body and mind, but I love the buzz of being typsy. I live in the UK and I know I need to stop, I drink around 15 pints a day which gets me extremely drunk, that may not seem a lot but its more than enough for me.

How do u go about helping myself?

Thank you for any help given, we are all in this together!",-0.6588520564763662,0.9104601712707208,1.891887661141805,99.4087216083487,85.40883977900552,5.5691835481890735,17.79036218538981,6.691623216298621,-0.3508381829343157,605,14,161,7,18,208,99,181,0.124,0.733,0.14300000000000002,0.3617,1,0,4,0,0,0,18.0,2,1,0,1,6,9,5,0,8,0,17,11,1,2,1,36,38,10,0,4,7,0,3,0,1,1,6,0,0,0,11,11,5,2,7,2,0,1,3,5,0,0,1,4,30,4,23,34,7,24,0,0,1,2,11,10,0,3,13,112,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385557773588014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074879064292027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643112125815151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11314432720187652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411774265235863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14255141703242666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08196781198118619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12450783030299985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13132639614811376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12852931806965248,0.0,0.0,0.1392298444465753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981957391279518,0.0,0.06640355363166016,0.0,0.07223282507038706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2509662804467421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3407649256334848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2793993448319929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1795464075359654,0.0,0.0,0.1122300221044868,0.11247789037277106,0.10673046129300867,0.0,0.0,0.1080543281569678,0.2294221406515941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12833293088819048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2827250716009764,0.0,0.0,0.2703407141431969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327905473624254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11570541023521505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08996074647002343,0.0,0.0,0.10625977014478573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11701492860921045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411197126251384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08629132175142963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0749657999770209,0.0,0.10195049411325602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184706129309394
alcoholism,randomthrowaway066,2019/04/09,"I (27/f) have chest pain/shortness of breath the day after drinking Hello. This is my first time posting and I hope this is the right place for this... I’ve been drinking for about 10 years now and heavily drinking for the last 4-5. I’ve tried getting sober several times but I suffer from bipolar 2 and anxiety and alcohol has been something like a crutch to cope with things, I guess. Well, almost every day after I binge drink I get symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, sharp chest pains and an elevated heart rate. I’ve been to the ER multiple times and they can never give me a solid explanation for any of this and end up dismissing it as “alcohol withdrawal.” Has anyone else had similar issues such as this? I know it can’t just 100% be anxiety. it’s truly unnerving. I swear, after today I am officially done drinking, because it seems like the issues get worse each time around.

alcoholism,Thenewhalflife,2019/04/09,"I’m 13, and already struggling with addiction. Don’t know if this is the right place for this, I didn’t see any rules about age or anything like that. I really don’t know why I’m posting this, I guess I just don’t want to talk to anyone irl. My parents have caught me several times, but I keep doing it regardless, and I don’t know why, I guess that’s what addiction is. Most of you are either addicted, recovering, or 100% sober, so I guess I’m asking for advice from the people that have recovered. I want to get help but I don’t want to have to go to meetings or anything because I’m afraid of two things, one being that my parents would be so disappointed that I even have to go to these meetings, and two, being that I have anxiety, like pretty bad. I have a hard time talking to cashiers sometimes, let alone a group of people whom I think will just look down on me for starting to drink so young. I wanted to get away from anxiety, but in the end it made it worse. I know all drugs are bad (except for some, like weed, possibly shrooms, etc.) But from my experience alcohol is the worst one, the only reason it’s legal, is because it would be abused more if it wasn’t.

alcoholism,thisisfrustratingjgp,2019/04/09,"Anyone have advice on how to get better sleep while drinking? I am a functioning alcoholic in the process of cutting down. I have switched from wine to beer, which has seemed to help immensely. My hangovers aren't as bad, which helps me to feel and do better at work.

But I still have trouble getting enough restful sleep each night. I need to drink probably at least 3 or 4 beers to get to sleep in the first place. But then of course I end up waking up in the middle of the night around 2 to 4 a.m. And then I absolutely CAN NOT fall back asleep. (And when I do, I often have sleep paralysis over and over until I am too scared to even try to sleep again.)

Some days at work I feel so bad, I am genuinely concerned that I might have a seizure or collapse or even die. I have left early or called in sick too many times for this reason. If I could just find a way to get enough sleep, I would continue to cut down and be fine I'm sure.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,drinkingbeer95,2019/04/09,"Did I have a seizure or was it sleep paralysis. I've been drinking quite often and heavily for last the last few years. Last week I ended up drinking 20-40 330ml 4.5% cans of beers a day and cut it down to 15 cans yesterday. I drank those quickly in the evening hoping to at least be able to sleep throough the night. Homever I ended up waking up at like 4am with horrible tremors and anxiety hearing whispers and footsteps even though I was alone. Those things are nothing new to me but in like 7am I got this weird feeling and I think I saw some bright light or something. Then suddenly my vision went black and my body sort of jolted and started shaking rapidly but I could not move otherwise. This lasted I think for a few seconds and I felt like I had fallen to the floor though I was still on the bed.  


I've had sleep paralysis sometimes before and that feels kind of similar but there's never been that jolting and shaking.",4.017142857142858,5.479562594594596,4.2976254826254845,87.78682432432434,71.70270270270271,7.231660231660233,29.43050193050193,7.7094869923839395,1.7630231660231668,740,30,148,9,14,231,117,185,0.08900000000000001,0.8109999999999999,0.1,0.6043,0,1,4,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,8,10,1,2,8,0,14,9,5,0,1,28,26,18,0,2,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,2,1,0,9,11,4,0,5,3,0,5,2,4,0,1,13,9,16,6,20,11,4,33,0,0,3,0,1,10,0,6,21,98,25,0,0.13100176988107065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356783255301337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002159953914069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114728574325238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14551343410285447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045942535390025,0.0,0.0,0.08448530406726748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566637231775589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2320573694586005,0.0,0.0,0.17305086699866035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13247686202927464,0.0,0.12578224290669407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047740826133202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14764851557459704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13011431625847447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13641818423565455,0.0,0.42713570810554063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19200254282670035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13923414938486314,0.0,0.0,0.10103664093522284,0.12652232567483546,0.0,0.12293628673011782,0.0,0.12569973133815904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13933650759510827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39328913337772015,0.0,0.0,0.1008515626218569,0.12956410011896116,0.0,0.09272372698423102,0.0,0.10461818264890778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703175490777437,0.16788128904032326,0.2574171475516734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10508171789364812,0.0,0.0,0.12143995313032298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843608447416709

alcoholism,_unknown_username,2019/04/09,"Just got through day 3, and my birthdays on Friday ...and I know I’m going to get festive under the guise of ‘ it’s my birthday (49) and I can do what I want ‘


Is it wrong that I don’t *really* want to give up entirely, just wind it right back? I think I’ve been sober maybe a dozen or two times since the beginning of the year and these days just happened.

My conflictions:

I know I drink too much by general standards
I don’t really want to give it up completely as it helps me deal with my world
I want to get my only friend off my case (I’m not very social, more shy and awkward)
It’s expensive
But you’ve gotta die from something right?
I’m uptight and can’t relax without it
I like it
I should be a better example for those around me
I don’t want to embarrass/hurt others (again)
People like me better when I’ve had a couple because I’m funny and playful (and not shy and awkward)
My SO thinks we drink too much
My memory is screwed
But it’s what I do..

Is this a familiar tale for anyone else?

I’m going through the angry stage and am working hard at keeping myself in check. 
I stopped myself twice when I got home from work today, mainly to prove the ‘I can quit whenever I want’ point to myself.

alcoholism,RoninVX,2019/04/09,"Memory issues during recovery Hiya! Quick info dump: 26 years old, heavy drinker for 10 years, today's my 70th day sober.

So far my struggles have been fairly simple to overcome, but I've been experiencing really annoying memory problems. Not talking sudden blackouts, nor am I worried I don't remember what I've done drunk, I mean stuff like thinking about it literally two minutes ago and poof, gone.

My memory just keeps restarting every few minutes it seems and it's absolutely horrid. I've read this can occur during withdrawal, but I'm past my withdrawal. Has anyone who's tried stopping experienced this? How do I counter it? I already take thiamine to up my intake...",4.616693989071038,7.459128237704919,5.688114754098362,72.38960382513662,74.0,8.32896174863388,29.83879781420765,9.075114841892004,3.213555191256831,543,24,83,13,12,179,91,122,0.175,0.764,0.061,-0.9483,0,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,0,5,5,2,1,0,0,9,1,0,1,0,15,16,7,0,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,2,1,2,5,2,0,1,3,4,0,1,4,2,10,1,5,12,1,13,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,11,45,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18038407015049027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2245593413203154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422868822188049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312360076400053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20824376366062128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145144251666686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21239359174325875,0.0,0.18087373152127084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994162927919505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22166329181478744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21353143993921014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942568828327592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947151067913012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20354784660571384,0.0,0.13036268468223722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305176495732117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852521829557184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1701290746878431,0.0,0.21273483518030847,0.2329505462417491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15300124449575922,0.16355978724498774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303899558292871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19288736029814893,0.0,0.0,0.1381582390321222,0.0,0.1987828760055446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20665679441221094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620853552523244

alcoholism,WovenTheWyrd,2019/04/10,"It's only two pints of beer a day.     Or so I thought.  Until my head hurt more and more frequently.  My sleep suffered, my memory went hazy, my focus dulled.  My relationship suffered.  Fatigue, anger, anxiety and depression came to torment me more and more often.  I wasted my time, money, and worst of all, my health.  I am 3 days clean and healing now.   Alcohol causes 5.6% of cancer and 4% of death in the U.S. (where liver disease/cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause).  It takes 20 gallons of water to produce one pint(16 oz) of beer.  780 million people in the world lack access to clean water.  200 chiIdren die every hour from unsafe water.  I spent $2 a day or more on beer.  Two weeks of that can give one person clean water.  So I'm gonna take that $2 a day and give to charitywater.org and other charities, as a reminder not to pollute my brain and the world.  As a thank you to all of the beautiful human beings coexisting on this Earth with me.  I want no attention or praise, just to share my story of conquering dependence. &lt;3",3.0126555555555536,5.114543310000002,4.6143333333333345,81.77022222222223,75.9,7.444444444444445,25.11111111111111,8.344100000000001,1.7973277777777783,802,28,150,15,18,269,127,200,0.204,0.6779999999999999,0.118,-0.9689,0,0,4,0,0,0,41.0,0,1,0,4,6,11,1,0,10,0,4,16,4,5,2,28,16,17,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,3,2,6,11,8,0,2,3,2,3,2,8,0,5,4,0,17,3,25,10,9,20,1,6,0,0,8,7,0,5,10,96,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16644535487766998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11914543998364115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17386430153208385,0.0,0.1781321963440134,0.0,0.3199885618528926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017737362556561,0.0,0.1341440000531517,0.0,0.16163999802889087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13122291641807127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2988119519596721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598405652109143,0.16555095992622504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15337866428564653,0.0,0.1667295608966885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21107535296852709,0.11845202643681214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10797482590170183,0.13599160100031407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16721316508342024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15585870849612007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23420356485336866,0.0,0.0,0.14339020381501158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236451099395646,0.09081687944240373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3042828726376412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918631619539724,0.0,0.1249302315840601,0.0,0.0,0.14437831596437695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,mcdeathdigga,2019/04/10,"How bad will my (22F) withdrawal symptoms be based on my drinking habits? I have been drinking alcohol socially since I was about 18. However, I never really drank outside of a social setting until I was about 20, when I would have wine with dinner alone, or have a beer here and there. However, since I turned 21, I started to drink a lot more, because I was finally of legal age to do so. This past fall, I made friends who party constantly, and I found myself going to the bars at least three times a week, and frat parties two times a week. And when I drank, I would almost always black out. That has been my lifestyle for the past few months. 
About two weeks ago, I went on a spring break trip to Cabo, and I drank all day, every day. After those four days, I came home and partied with my friends for the whole weekend. Then, on Monday, it was syllabus week, which at our school basically means: party week. So I was blackout drunk all day everyday that entire week. And that weekend, I went on a formal to Vancouver and was drunk that entire weekend too.
However, when I came home from Vancouver, I counted up the days that I had been drunk, and realized that I hadn’t been sober at all for 13 days straight. It was the longest bender I’ve ever been on/heard of. That’s when I realized I needed to detox, and I’ve decided that I don’t really want to drink for a while because of how terrible I feel. But I’m worried that I may face some pretty severe withdrawal symptoms after a bender like that. What I’m wondering is: is a 13 day bender really enough time to make me experience severe withdrawal symptoms? Or would I have had to have drank for much longer than that?
It’s been two days since my last drink and I’ve experienced some symptoms of withdrawal such as extreme night sweats, waking up delirious and confused multiple times throughout the night, minor hallucinations (seeing things move in the corner of my eye or behind trees), general confusion and extreme fatigue.
However, I was researching withdrawal symptoms and they apparently get worse around day 4? So I’m just nervous that this might get worse?
Basically, am I okay detoxing at home or should I seek help? Or am I being a hypochondriac even asking?

Any info would be very helpful thank you!

TL;DR I have been drinking a lot for months now and recently went on a 13 day bender where I wasn’t sober for 13 days straight. Now I am on day 2 of not drinking and have experienced some withdrawal symptoms (night sweats, confusion, fatigue, etc) and am wondering if a 13 bender is enough to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. And if so, should I seek help or am I okay to detox at home? I feel like 13 days isn’t that long, and that the withdrawal symptoms shouldn’t be that severe. But I don’t know. Any info is greatly appreciated!",5.43376497315159,6.427314745353161,5.898556381660472,79.39055245766214,67.90334572490707,9.174803800082612,30.371953738124734,9.372597083632963,2.6488226352746813,2215,83,415,43,36,714,228,538,0.091,0.795,0.114,0.6538,5,1,10,0,0,0,72.0,1,1,1,0,24,16,0,4,22,2,54,37,5,5,5,80,85,43,0,11,12,0,2,2,2,10,14,0,4,0,25,25,19,0,12,16,0,9,8,8,0,5,30,7,49,8,54,41,16,89,0,2,3,0,12,21,0,21,59,278,74,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04588589066051128,0.055320248345666095,0.051834426174438585,0.05361215909340072,0.0,0.0,0.04307200867219207,0.0,0.0,0.07040293982750692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04608116349680125,0.048392592746327005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04322099250090874,0.06311002136402878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184090399801456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05593877235769781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.433987625401046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549648558350837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10697263012663974,0.05773082995243845,0.034189803627560904,0.0468237341248764,0.04361361919787753,0.0,0.0,0.05063537624574526,0.0,0.0,0.05234712748375242,0.03698039562966375,0.0,0.05670521345828845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056756836104996586,0.079985873288561,0.0,0.054089375708769816,0.0,0.02941882022918729,0.0,0.0,0.057070276218909574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408947121189494,0.0,0.20769508196444975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028448281960990533,0.042194778436333014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0505788026306204,0.0,0.0,0.04580973862520778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08801624059249638,0.0,0.048980591694516,0.03455304358378242,0.0,0.0,0.05638645121587915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05491369656681841,0.0,0.0,0.08263547234705935,0.05501721324234455,0.03805268505511356,0.038382540752113385,0.03992378625633111,0.0,0.0,0.14573174610110867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988296813380393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052662859077607566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09948452583228708,0.0,0.05111095901969481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05238819176744319,0.04124941098384318,0.0,0.0,0.23391550574336084,0.0,0.1284597852207266,0.0,0.0,0.10553428261487664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03663900761885199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4304230666236262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04765757320900947,0.0,0.0,0.03438987231057156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207366184156865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05630464726616365,0.15169847269710693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04271093331573394,0.03053190001515432,0.0,0.2491329881398441,0.0,0.0,0.14395795486299706,0.0,0.05779294446651674,0.0,0.0,0.11227225746298447,0.0,0.052569115802406106,0.10550440069939604,0.1470873722764114,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Jess562323,2019/04/10,"Does it really get better? Here i am in full blown delirium tremens, 27 years old, got fired frim my crappy job at the gas station 2 days ago for not showing up because i was drunk. And to make it worse i am hiv positive also so that just fuels my depression even more. I stopped taking my meds about 2 months ago, because my insurance crapped out i drink everyday and today i am hallucinating seeing and hearing things that are not there. So as i was about to start i ran to the liquor store and bought 2 beers.  That stopped with the hallucinations for now , but im sure theyl be back.  I keep getting open sores in my body and a red rash i think its the Hiv coming back stronger and the alcohol aint helping, I am in constant pain. I have diarreah , the open sores started of as a rash first in my privates then they became sores and they burn , also the red rash in my back is very itchy, All this happend because of alcohol , me getting hiv because yep u guessed it i was drunk and i dont even know who gave it to me! I was a whore well i still kinda am. and i am ashamed of myself and feel dirty. Everyday i meet guys online after i have a few drinks and i end up with a few guys over and its usually no condom sex. I tried to stop i feel disgusting when im sober , but drunk me is very different. i look at my pics from before and i see a very healthy girl and had big beautiful golden locks , everyone always liked my hair, now im super skinny with very short hair i cut it on one day while drunk, i look like a meth addict even tho i dont do meth. I hate druk me. I have a very supportive family, they really have tried to help me even get into rehab , it didnt work for me . So at this point they just kinda stopped.

They were all disappointed which I’m used to but grandmother hasn’t ever seen me like that. Tonight I called her for a chat and she said “Oh hello” the greeting for the past 26 years has always been “Oh hi my dear !!!!” Very enthusiastic.

alcoholism,Faceless-Edict,2019/04/10,"My University promotes drinking with an official annual celebration and I could use some backup explaining why this is a bad thing to expose kids to Hey everyone, I attend the University of Calgary which has an annual celebration called ""BSD"" its a school (and liquor company) sponsored event that is centered around students drinking. The primary attractions are a ""boozy pancake breakfast"" (AM drinking) and a ""beer gardens"".

95% of the student populatuon ranges in age from 17-25. Ive tried to voice my opinion that absolutley no educational institution should be promoting alcohol consumption epecially given the young susceptible demographic that attends the UofC, however I have been met with increadibly toxic (and sometimes voilent) responses from the students who attend the UofC.

I fear much of this toxicity steams from very troubling loyalty to the act of drinking itself and it makes me very sad that so many young students are already devolping behaviour that either is or is related to alcoholism.

I would very much appreciate anyone who is willing to post on the r/Ucalgary subreddit and share any stories you may have regarding drinking in your youth or in university and how it affected your life or the lives of those around you. I think many of these kids havent come face to face with the consequences of thier actions and that a posting campaign from this community might help open thier eyes and mame a real difference at my school.

alcoholism,yeeetable_account,2019/04/10,"My father is an alcoholic. As his teen daughter, what can I do? He promises he will stop, and then he goes at it again. He often says he’s going for the groceries or something but picks up alcoholic drinks. He has never been violent, only shouting at times. He often proposes crazy ideas while drunk (like moving out of the country). He’s a big weight on us when he’s drunk and it’s draining not only for him but for us as well.

alcoholism,Hautpotato,2019/04/10,"Being in love with an alcoholic Well my plan to go to bed at 11pm failed, an hour and a half later I stay up crying and worrying about my love. I look at old pictures and reminisce on the beautiful life and love we created together. I shed more and more tears wondering if the alcohol will ever loose the battle, and you will decide to win. I shed more tears feeling lost and helpless, feeling like you, the man I love, are standing in a glass box and I cant get to you. 

I feel that I need to protect you and make sure you know how beautiful you are.  But you don’t need to hear that from me do you? Does it make a difference ? I have made myself into a crazy person, worrying about your safety every waking moment. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I don’t know you. I miss us. I miss the man I fell madly in love with. I miss myself. 

I am mad at myself for staying with you, but I just have so much hope for you to figure this out. You deserve so much love. You are the sweetest man I have yet to meet. You are gold and pixie dust and everything magical. But when do I say “enough is enough” and I chose to walk away? When.. I am broken but feel hopeful. Please. I know I can’t help you, and that breaks me. I want to fix everything for you. I want to make your pain go away. I want to make you see your beauty. But I cant. You have to do that.

alcoholism,StewDog80,2019/04/10,"Almost 11 months sober. Gabapentin question..... So,  a quick background. Recovering alcoholic, just shy of 11 months sober. Got sober last May after being stricken with Pancreatitis (I have Chronic Pancreatitis) other than that I’m on Lexapro for depression and anxiety. I can NOT take Benzos with my Alcoholism history. They think ill abuse them which I 100% will, and have. Resulted in blowing through my prescription of klonopin in 10 days and having a seizure. Because of my Chronic Pancreatitis and nerve pain, my Nurse Practitioner today prescribed me Gabapentin for my anxiety and pain. She’s starting me on a low dose of 100mgs 3x a day, and said she will increase it most likely on my next visit in 3.5 weeks, just wants to see how I’ll respond. So to sum it up, I’d like to know what to expect. 
I’m also on 7.5mgs of Mirtazapine, and the only other thing I take is Kratom. Anyone with experience with Gabapentin, please, how will it make me feel, and will I like it, and are their side effects (there’s always some, but curious what people have experienced) 

Thanks to all that give me feedback!",6.804500574052813,7.8819571194029905,6.408159203980103,76.65795637198623,64.87064676616916,9.567699961729813,33.869498660543435,9.661875296680813,3.212607041714505,875,37,155,17,13,272,127,201,0.095,0.838,0.067,-0.4102,0,0,2,0,1,0,37.0,0,0,3,1,9,8,0,0,5,0,13,8,0,5,1,33,28,15,0,2,4,0,1,3,0,5,8,1,0,0,12,13,2,0,5,0,0,2,1,4,0,0,2,4,20,4,27,20,4,23,0,2,1,0,10,10,0,5,14,100,32,1,0.0,0.18646570719150185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336375756000657,0.15759007608154546,0.0,0.0,0.1258541253094569,0.13095005818706265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2407855567851893,0.0,0.0,0.11004147858875897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593540241764788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20298996083959803,0.0,0.13554835899143694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15394465385091347,0.0,0.0,0.07957441040297436,0.11242997735119584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15097011315866912,0.0,0.0,0.12586855880727466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08649014273900782,0.12828305114535574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2306589831200906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10505019866319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25123323118081337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16737195263267526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11969210547142145,0.33491990297980817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10910521870201173,0.0,0.0,0.1727524055508174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1762979706276869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14970132244541054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12540888932360586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113920694091632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366554514047596,0.0,0.0,0.14489136163280714,0.0,0.0,0.10455411574576584,0.1008406629538294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491747517220233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09282488109562684,0.0,0.12623813120922114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,justhrowmeinthetrass,2019/04/10,"Anyone else just feel numb, nothingness? I drink daily. I live within walking distance to a few bars and usually start my round at 6 or 7 after work. I tell myself I have friends because other regulars talk to me.

Truth is I am alone. I don’t date. I don’t do anything social outside of hitting up the bar. I drink alone at home sometimes. Truth is I’m miserable, but I don’t want to stop, because I am so truly lonely.

I got trashed last night and ordered $25 worth of Taco Bell and then passed out. 

I haven’t filed my taxes yet. I purposefully miss student loan and car payments by a few days because I just don’t care anymore. I have trouble remembering people’s names. 

Hell, last night two guys came up  and shook my hand and talked to me for five minutes and I had no recollection of ever meeting them. I’m told I’m a nice drunk by the one pretty bartender I see on Mondays.

I’ve been told that before. 

I feel pathetic but I don’t feel like life is worth trying to change. I don’t even feel actively depressed. I feel nothing. Numb. I feel meaningless.",1.6391543340380572,3.870620046511629,3.2046194503171246,89.4933562367865,81.09302325581395,5.7695560253699805,24.65644820295983,6.980632752743323,1.003837209302326,830,32,170,10,22,273,132,215,0.181,0.626,0.193,0.4511,0,4,2,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,1,1,6,15,1,2,5,0,17,9,1,0,3,28,36,12,0,1,5,0,8,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,2,9,5,1,8,5,4,5,9,9,0,3,6,9,29,6,19,29,2,27,1,4,2,0,11,7,1,1,15,96,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2648971981864361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12682593532921574,0.08941902262117195,0.13103162055159098,0.10523711346962096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23386953798613905,0.0,0.1088193250186941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14626450165922916,0.1303856141464702,0.0,0.13528364401104606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824741912457409,0.0,0.11014575534934867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2505540250448262,0.0,0.0,0.10683014227272317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08446575684171764,0.1156778255908104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.387970032490104,0.0913599018933158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09880237098697264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228000978925172,0.0,0.0,0.12662463767762885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827744260783105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2084840225593136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09032780304057504,0.06247735276401744,0.0,0.11292335470274226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24001975100304346,0.0,0.12270753826804427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665707813669214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886582236473121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13010335765289616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448669237833802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019064852193752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13036098643496666,0.0,0.0,0.12647991848719087,0.0,0.09051650434052436,0.0,0.0,0.10691621982859599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20557561016880185,0.11177569816852743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2443960721873593,0.0,0.08682441071635127,0.0,0.1249234659517491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408454599153343,0.0,0.07542892233861123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310061319587318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,caaIee,2019/04/10,"Advice please. My closest friend is an alcoholic, behaviours such as frequent black outs, sleeping in till 4-5pm and an evident unfulfilling energy resonating from him.

Well he is my cousin if not my brother, and having seen alcohol take lives within my town, lives within this page shared by you loving people; I need some of your strengths and wisdom. 

I never hold a grudge against him, nor belittle him.

Is there something a close friend can do? Or is it his responsibility?

alcoholism,BaldingWayToEarly,2019/04/10,"I’m very addicted to alcohol, just woke up today after not remembering anything from yesterday. Like, the entire day I have no recollection of. Just woke up my gf, had to put together pieces of the whole day. I apparently didn’t cause much harm to anyone but myself. 

I’m just so tired of this. I wake up everyday feeling sick to my stomach, and all I can do is drink to alleviate it. I feel like I may actually get very sick from this. The amounts of times I’ve tried to quit, man it hurts being that guy. The guy you see when you go to work, the guy with a large beer walking the streets very early in the morning.

alcoholism,_bjmw_,2019/04/11,"Have been drunk in weeks... It’s been 2 weeks since I blacked out drunk and I was forbidden by friends and family from drinking. They took all my drinks and won’t allow me to buy any or anything. They say I have a problem and they say I don’t need it. And I keep trying to find an excuse to drink. From one friend returning home from the military to seeing my ex in public. 

Drinking is and was my crutch. I’d rather get drunk than sit down and get high. They say I don’t need it. And I’ll make jokes like a little won’t hurt and what not. And I honestly just want to feel that warmth of whiskey gives me. 

I know I have a problem, it’s literally lead me to becoming the man, I promised I’d never be. I realized it bit by bit and didn’t stop. Now I just yearn for it. It really has become a crutch. 

I’m at an impasse now. Like I know I can go without drinking, but part of me needs it.",-0.15279017857142918,1.8181837656250048,1.9267559523809543,97.53312500000004,86.34375,5.5321428571428575,19.03869047619048,6.868970318607317,-1.220238095234194e-05,681,19,167,9,21,227,107,192,0.092,0.8140000000000001,0.095,-0.1156,0,0,6,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,4,1,5,11,0,0,8,0,16,9,0,3,2,38,32,13,0,8,7,1,1,2,2,2,0,3,1,1,10,12,9,2,5,10,1,3,8,4,0,1,6,6,25,7,21,23,4,18,0,2,2,0,14,7,0,1,9,103,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923715073723853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09588549347100084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573729258696147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544178946537433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5707229973459856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10984406922883888,0.0,0.058915682232220414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10649657110115338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18004511499501685,0.0,0.12175309800470566,0.11177597381338618,0.06622062938630502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12310908615426745,0.11687840420671106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12473636954937335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103567748254411,0.0,0.0,0.12807197037404133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11385093344030105,0.11678299518466595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0777775680841336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2591928554152629,0.08986690264198938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895652423315877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12617909673362326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22298655522701685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464527654393716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27798258148371696,0.0,0.0,0.09285083276230076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09638600689258033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09741539044852576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12945728044506874,0.07910898724212398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06872612904297658,0.0,0.18692958166445486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11232049131266872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Stromboli34,2019/04/11,"Lost but not without direction Hello all!  Quick bio - sober since 2010, met my wife 5 years ago, and had our first born 16 months ago.  
For the past 6 it 7 years I've consistently made a weekly meeting (Sundays, at one point my home group meeting was on Sundays).  Typically I'd hit sporadic meetings between.  If I became busy with work, I'd attend every other week, or when I could.  In between my only social group was other alcoholics (I lost all other friends years ago).  Basically, I've always relied on a good support system.    
When I met my wife, my pattern remained.  She had the standpoint that I needed to make meetings, and that I shouldn't stop doing so.  She's always been pretty supportive, or so I though.  When our son was born, things started taking a different road.    
Going off my sponsor's observations - I seem to pick up the parenting duties quite frequently.  I don't mind it.  I do it for my son.  But, I've always had the thought that if I needed to step away for myself, I could.  Until tonight.

Tonight my sponsor said something to me about it in front of my wife (premeditated, we spoke about things prior today).  Asked me when I last went to a meeting, and that I should try to get to 2 or 3 a week.  He's trying to get me out of my house, out of my slump.  Out of the role of responsibility while the other parent is around.  You know, get me to stay sober.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife's reaction surprised me, and only angered me.  ""If I need a break, then you know you should be around for that"".    I spoke no words, as you will never make amends for an unkind yet unspoken word.  

I'll be divorced and sober before I'm drunk and married.  She doesn't seem to understand how serious I was when I said it to her.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading, it just helps to blow off some steam.

alcoholism,_Americuh_,2019/04/11,Slipped after one sober week I’ve been struggling to stop drinking. I’ve realized my loneliness drives my urge to drink. I try to go on dates where everyone wants to “grab a drink” and I feel too weak to say no or that I don’t drink. With the loneliness comes boredom which is another driver for drinking. I made it one week without alcohol and did the whole “I’m going to reward myself” thing. I want to stop viewing alcohol as some sort of a reward because I always feel terrible the day after. And the week I had without it was amazing!I felt happy. Everything felt in place and I felt in control. I struggle with admitting that I do not have control of my drinking once I start. I woke up feeling ashamed today. Hoping to get through the next 24 hours without too much guilt.,3.535035425101217,5.536258019736844,4.34105263157895,84.76467611336035,74.0657894736842,7.3085020242914975,30.113360323886642,8.139509932561175,2.2466643724696356,617,28,116,10,13,198,95,152,0.177,0.7090000000000001,0.113,-0.8583,0,0,8,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,4,3,10,0,4,7,0,8,9,0,3,0,30,26,6,0,3,5,0,7,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,6,7,8,4,8,6,0,4,6,6,0,2,9,9,16,4,24,17,3,23,0,0,1,0,2,6,0,4,13,76,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2159472791067099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08406761860776403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1059419967121742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061588829612494074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870310548827814,0.0,0.0,0.22663438709663994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06515798024576297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5938437455806007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654144043848613,0.09080202030664873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15325608733534374,0.0,0.29102281121187684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05278561585581025,0.0,0.11483885870010074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10755159550516953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003486481117525,0.09949723514317918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09559994596712694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742709409853915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10744982991500956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075969359809817,0.1369252635303099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10555806788951397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034556273461363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07151173612799724,0.0,0.0,0.16893636262005948,0.0,0.21124342987158587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06712189095655888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957675491503823,0.0,0.0,0.06859483133880599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11918386000425868,0.0,0.2431279347679317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11279982901674016,0.0,0.29217685977586816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,stlgerg,2019/04/11,"My sister diagnosed with stage 4 liver failure. Found out today that my sister is in stage 4 liver failure and my heart is breaking.   Watching her sit in pain and being helpless to save her is killing me.  I knew she had a drinking problem but because we lived in different locations did not realize the extent of the damage she was doing to her body.  I’m no stranger to alcoholism it’s been ravaging our family for generations taking my grandfather’s sister, my dad’s brother and almost my dad.  I always expected that it would come to a point with my sister that we would have to get her help but then like a light switch her liver just quit.  Maybe it’s because my Dad had so many second chances I expected to get the same with my sister.  Unfortunately, I found out today that’s likely not the case.  Things are bad and I am praying 🙏.   

I know I have it in me as well and can’t even count the negative impacts it’s had on my life.  As a result,  I’ve made the decision to get alcohol out of my life before it’s too late and i think I have the will power to do it. I grew up as a kid thinking alcohol equals fun. As I’ve gotten older I’ve learned it equals pain and loss.   

I don’t want my kids to grow up equating fun with alcohol I just want to break the cycle and avoid them having to experience the pain and heartbreak I feel right now.",3.497145454545457,4.583259105454545,5.0052272727272715,83.66784090909091,72.49090909090908,7.972727272727273,26.84090909090909,8.395991825355821,1.7496363636363634,1054,36,216,17,20,355,143,275,0.177,0.725,0.098,-0.9764,2,1,5,0,0,0,17.0,3,0,1,3,7,17,1,1,14,0,23,16,5,2,0,48,40,17,1,7,6,9,1,2,0,3,10,0,0,2,13,19,5,1,10,1,0,3,6,11,1,1,11,3,38,6,32,25,4,26,1,4,1,0,23,12,0,1,8,147,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4990531310415003,0.11690173784315465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971399326237302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747593457789276,0.14233149119748092,0.0,0.0993401081713261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12967569520597175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10056417616550363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11849218103708513,0.0,0.12197209546901013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11436417174264918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710797158489721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141975307983377,0.11005536886209318,0.0,0.059029014359626035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25600641368439225,0.0,0.0,0.1829809593510464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383415932159741,0.07825069793638506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12915937046673695,0.0,0.06415916689614788,0.0,0.13169173739433354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16491875360166885,0.11406994080820433,0.0,0.10308663713281008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046550935869262,0.0,0.1183595713672813,0.11728452325436955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726699009556347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036032926536307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117077497177872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241710677874338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969829931833177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08777657269788061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07755918477385446,0.1496090240918281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22131834887371835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771666573151325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10496641440085894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658624460896887,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,misspukypie,2019/04/12,"Need advice So for the last 1-2 years a quite young person in my family (18) likes to drink a lot, sometimes too excessively. A couple of days ago she had a couple of drinks (like 3 glasses of champagne and 2 glasses of whisky which is not enough to make her senseless) and all of a sudden she starts insulting the other people in the room, totally out of her mind. She was taken home by a friend where her mother took care of her. Apparently she was really scared, said she had seen the devil and couldn't sleep for the whole night because she was too scared. That she was insulting her friends she can't even remember anymore. The next day though she was better and didn't have a phase like that again. Of course she's not drinking atm.

Do you guys know similar reactions to alcohol? Can it be a mini psychosis? Because I thought a psychosis would last for longer..

alcoholism,PullYourGoalie,2019/04/12,"Give Alcoholic Brother-In-Law a Second Chance? My BIL has been staying with us for two months, on the condition he stops drinking, goes to AA daily, stops gambling, and stops lying.  He's managed to break all our rules and I'm inclined to invite him to leave.  The backstory on him is so long and full of deceit, lies, stealing, gambling, owing $350k+ in family loans, IRS, unpaid child support, etc.; and I don't have the space to even summarize it here.  I knew he would burn us like he's burned everyone else who has helped him, but we wanted to give him a chance since he has nowhere else to turn.  He will likely end up on the street if we kick him out.

Please give me your opinion on whether we should give him another chance.",6.181041666666665,5.7890361319444485,5.934166666666666,84.5775,66.15277777777779,9.144444444444442,30.5,8.472884824447931,2.016891666666666,569,18,118,7,8,177,100,144,0.092,0.809,0.098,0.4404,0,0,2,0,0,0,25.0,6,1,0,0,3,4,0,0,6,0,10,2,0,0,1,21,20,8,0,4,3,0,0,2,0,3,1,0,0,1,2,9,2,3,1,1,4,0,1,1,1,2,2,0,17,3,17,15,3,18,0,0,0,0,26,10,0,2,8,67,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537579306694789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15086480601042676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409420945074992,0.0,0.0,0.24037712434686195,0.0,0.1274299744914454,0.0,0.1604579374599629,0.09502765466492068,0.0,0.0,0.1374781119454368,0.0,0.0,0.1356319375452988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5520695657309783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964359475155001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15234216828645805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14057948510336804,0.0,0.0,0.1273242768454321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11483913763895998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1579308372962313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1190143533362742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15335091949734325,0.0,0.360856209516584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16326691323546885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15649398384160518,0.14054433921966128,0.0,0.34612626892560344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486082232321247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10220421394133196,0.0,0.0,0.0

1. AA states that it is not affiliated with any religion, however the Lord’s Prayer is said at the end of every meeting. Do you see this as a contradiction, and if so, what is your opinion on it?
2. Do you identify with a religion? Do you regularly attend any religious services?
3. Do you feel that AA has a bias towards Christianity?
4. What is your own conception of God? If your higher power isn’t a Christian God, how do you feel about the language used?
5. If you are a woman, how do you feel about the male-centered language used in the Big Book?

alcoholism,FuzzyNatural,2019/04/12,"A New Day!  I've known for a while that I had a problem with alcohol, and tried and failed to quit countless times, but it wasn't until my wonderful girlfriend left me that it hit me that I needed to quit. It all started a couple of months ago when she made a comment about how I reminded her of a relative that had past away due to complications related to alcoholism, and that hit me hard. I kept telling myself, I can do it, and then end up drinking the next day. Always seeing the look on her face as I disappointed her was killing me inside, so of course, I turned to my buddy alcohol instead of talking to her. Fast forward to last Thursday, I came home from work and all her things were gone, I was in shock and depressed, and surprise, surprise, my buddy alcohol came to cheer me up. After four nights of drinking until I passed out, and four mornings of terrible hangovers, I decided it was time to ditch that douchebag buddy (alcohol) and clean up my act. It's been a rough few days of reflection, not giving into the lies of alcohol, and most importantly, trying to work things out with my girlfriend, but I need to do this-this time.

alcoholism,haveyouseenmybong420,2019/04/13,"Help me quit. This is the 1st time I have ever admitted to this but I am an alcoholic. I started drinking  Heavily when I was 20 because I have been my dad's caregiver (by myself cause my sisters dont care) since I was 18  And that can get very stressful for a young man, I'm 28 now.  My mother was an extreme alcoholic and she even tried to get me to drink her shot when I was around 5, that's when she got help and was 13 years sober before she passed away 

Recently I have found the Want to quit but it is so hard  Because even now that I live away from my dad and he is not my responsibility anymore, I can't  Stop, I find other excuses to drink.

I plan my day so that I can drink, If something goes wrong to where I can't I will lie or cancel plans to make sure I can stay home get drunk and play my games.

 I'm not sure what I hoped for in writing this post but I just need help and I could use all the advice you guys have to offer. I want to be healthy, I want to quit drinking so that when I do have kids with my wife that I am marrying week from today but I will be there for all the important moments.",1.3438381742738557,2.652667813278012,3.06385684647303,94.55860684647304,78.33609958506224,6.479751037344397,21.593568464730293,7.1686216300943375,0.3310878008298759,857,23,210,10,20,285,130,241,0.08199999999999999,0.787,0.131,0.7825,0,0,8,0,0,0,15.0,0,1,0,5,16,7,0,1,7,0,28,8,0,3,5,36,45,19,0,7,9,5,1,0,0,2,2,0,1,3,12,8,8,1,3,8,0,1,5,2,0,0,8,1,40,5,21,32,2,25,0,0,0,0,22,5,0,3,17,139,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10422320214738663,0.0,0.2279660785630869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057742888927325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09494662851430627,0.0,0.0,0.2004140175763902,0.0,0.0,0.1300332565256586,0.0,0.09075656877089856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874310197188884,0.10956529499465187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08515629529008263,0.0,0.0,0.06878442416668602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12500026954726198,0.5224123472760881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14089082556383126,0.09647663713864103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09748183259571896,0.0,0.0,0.11694301585250876,0.0,0.0,0.16717038391449685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08530270465040786,0.0,0.0,0.1056064043358624,0.0,0.0,0.09554300386209966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21446820360975466,0.0,0.10698486265920712,0.10593366998543734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417937673441182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07119384026437947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790842192706159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10214715504491184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403259849557613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10531012827811424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822710901694532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08210915185594443,0.0,0.0,0.07549180579525636,0.11368131585030605,0.0,0.08916935715169652,0.1221743142844506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20104440850030894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06219208667324276,0.0,0.10109760458070984,0.0,0.0,0.07241255724401514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211671051985673,0.0,0.08800253316758799,0.18872576657766213,0.0,0.0855531685132575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11661180917944615,0.0,0.06868309455512993

alcoholism,zenzenzenzen,2019/04/13,"A dozen years, dozens of beers I want to start off that I have successfully detoxed 3 times professionally and attempted 90 inpatient rehab twice.   
  
The narcos they put me on in rehab after detox made me hallucinate crazy images and they ended up having to ambulance me to an emergency clinic.   
  
I’m not Christian but have nothing against AA for people it works for. I don’t know how but I can sell myself long enough to get what I want but then everything gets tarnished.   
  
I have managed to cut my alcohol intake about 75% (my partner confirms) and kidney, liver function and blood pressure are all normalizing. I am on an anti anxiety and see my general practitioner about once every 3 weeks.   
  
I just don’t know what I can do outside of this to survive. At best I could go to an atheist alcoholics group.   
  
Is this just a long game? If I wake up in 90 days and I don’t need a shot for breakfast any more, is that success?",3.7137827715355813,5.687750078651687,4.948112359550558,80.72291760299626,73.49438202247191,7.892734082397005,28.158801498127346,8.648137234880735,2.245679700374532,726,29,136,14,15,240,118,178,0.079,0.828,0.093,0.6548,0,0,3,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,2,6,5,5,1,1,7,0,15,13,4,2,1,24,27,12,0,6,7,0,0,0,1,0,7,0,0,1,7,6,4,0,2,2,1,2,4,2,1,3,1,1,21,3,24,25,4,20,1,0,1,0,5,8,0,1,10,96,28,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4090518296482338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13014426096350099,0.0,0.1464043867591605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20084041986309914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15280053336897598,0.0,0.0,0.123423602029004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16950496143774024,0.1977456328565714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1612450347203727,0.0,0.17199907632935135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999752238995179,0.0,0.1087650778938006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21035375173625145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3387287288238761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18108740695362846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14190507988229126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18751075512273271,0.18363328139863372,0.0,0.0,0.20381235507864695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326780796120795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19238872215294636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.152504259646684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13545901863400722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11159461532032856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22576054767140674,0.0,0.15351266439786124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13932616807972753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12324178084198432

alcoholism,renichka80,2019/04/14,"Weird withdrawal symptom I'm sober close to 5 months now, but one of the withdrawal symptoms I had when I would come off a heavy binge was a shock type feeling. I've tried to describe it, and I wonder if anyone knows what I'm talking about. It's like a jolt through my body, it lasts just a moment, but I imagine it feels like being hit with defibrillator paddles. It's frightening and extremely uncomfortable.
One night I drank heavily and in the middle of the night this jolt hit me from my spine to my brain, and felt for a moment like my brain was shocked. I didn't know what happened but my brain had a buzzing to it and I was absolutely terrified. 
I ended having a lot of neurological issues beyond tremor and that scared me enough to finally quit. I've mentioned these symptoms to my doctor and no real answer.

Not unusual I don't think - I live in a blue law state so it was impossible for me to get it before work or after work, so I had to get it on lunch.

On the way there I went back and forth with myself. ""I could definitely get a shot, drink it before I go back and no one would notice. I could totally get away with it. I would even work better, because I'd feel better. Just this once""

alcoholism,Rchlmnzr15,2019/04/15,"How do I support my brother during recovery? Hello, first time poster. I’m sure some iteration of this question gets asked often, but here goes. My brother will be coming out of rehabilitation in just a few days. This was a huge step in the right direction for him and our family could not be prouder or happier for him. We all are looking for the best ways to support him and make his continued recovery easier. But no one quite knows how best to handle this? Drinking is a big part of most of our family gatherings. No one wants to put him in an uncomfortable position by exposing him to this early after rehab. On the other hand we don’t want him to feel like he’s burdened his family into having to change their habits around him. Before going into rehab he had a lot of unrealistic fears about being abandoned by his family or friends because he’d be sober. What’s the best way for us to show him we support him while also showing him that nothing has changed?",5.755784313725492,6.5116981925133715,6.830815508021393,73.84465463458113,67.07486631016042,9.869696969696973,30.556595365418893,9.928628108626363,3.0010146167557936,770,28,139,17,12,259,123,187,0.112,0.662,0.226,0.9828,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,6,0,1,5,8,12,0,1,9,0,15,4,1,3,2,32,29,10,0,3,6,2,2,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,7,10,1,1,3,3,0,4,4,3,0,3,2,3,24,9,28,20,9,24,0,1,1,0,30,11,0,7,8,110,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743748425933628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10846574731110517,0.11390638469700715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07427411886577433,0.0,0.10367907959621718,0.0,0.3835988789993642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2577866328995885,0.10495661236053264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09728140273556134,0.0,0.0,0.07857839806791539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11935936333602737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4594494432627385,0.13710680075051754,0.06160728019062533,0.08704437873210906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10363925444399257,0.0,0.0,0.09413529154029894,0.0,0.0636577303245621,0.0,0.06924595819702682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06696150722908861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05952614050003265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10231709826998002,0.0,0.0,0.10358622251412818,0.0,0.0,0.08133088250795371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691126208477105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.165127399938683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13194366376049646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248546748424355,0.13649159847362893,0.1295946044117215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040529157951572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4147966202514559,0.11483520980115368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07104740066503655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14656164731054294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14373184618923687,0.1934259712515382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,inagreenshade,2019/04/15,"I have questions about medical detox Hello. My sister is married to an alcoholic who has been repeatedly dishonest with her. (Just for background: there are several alcoholics in my family, and my dad has been involved in AA for 30 years.)

My brother in law had alcohol withdrawal seizures 2 years ago, but he never stopped drinking. He is currently in a treatment center receiving a medical detox. He told my sister he was being released today. Then he called and said the doctor ""forgot to sign his release papers."" That sounds like a lie to me. 
Then he also said the doctor said he still had elevated enzyme levels. That sounds like the truth.

So, what does it mean to have elevated enzyme levels? Does this mean he is not done with withdrawal? Does this mean he has liver damage?  I can't find an answer with my Google skills, and my sister does not have access to his medical records. I would appreciate any help because my heart is breaking for my sister.",4.46215909090909,6.966525443181819,5.260227272727274,76.94159090909096,72.97727272727272,8.263636363636364,28.04545454545455,9.017664075816787,2.703006818181818,762,30,126,17,16,247,105,176,0.036000000000000004,0.85,0.114,0.9125,1,0,4,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,1,6,4,0,0,8,0,20,13,2,0,2,23,28,8,0,1,4,6,0,2,0,1,10,5,0,0,7,6,4,2,6,1,0,1,4,1,1,0,11,5,16,3,16,15,0,20,0,1,0,0,29,7,0,1,13,81,23,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10378005305662504,0.3753531788820417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09362495199214302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961511398675811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07136792237532072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11954681389549038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396627457465141,0.4098129970292935,0.11980852202403765,0.0,0.11468907214809942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036802826774808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10700456248778924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13873461175527368,0.07847300255415911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11439400532468305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3825874673864423,0.0,0.3538226781234618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09029557008183037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13115095747353422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33409582147543754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322615909126541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934963628617128,0.09788006436959143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11097354921082447,0.11187031918881944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08316682469858942,0.0,0.0,0.15078511118392526
alcoholism,mrkeyrose,2019/04/15,"Trying to resist my cravings right now. I think I was drunk everyday from the middle of March til last Thursday. I was blacking out all of last week. My withdrawal hit a point where I would fall asleep and wake up every 20 minutes. I would hear voices while trying to sleep and have the most vivid dreams. And my body felt like pins and needles. And I could think of speak correctly. This went on for two days. 

I tapered it out with beer so I don’t have any withdrawals anymore, so I have a few days with sobriety. I’ve been drinking nothing but water non stop, it’s working like a charm. I barely drank water during my bender.

I honestly feels pretty good being sober after the withdrawals go away but I noticed the slightest inconvenience will make me want a fucking drink.

Typing this did help a lot though. Gonna see a doctor soon for a physical though cause narcolepsy after binge drinking is weird as fuck. Plus I’ve been wondering if I’m bipolar or not.",2.8111884550084905,5.3284854838709705,3.390260328239957,88.1922325976231,78.56989247311827,5.8512733446519505,23.76796830786644,7.0608816371341465,0.9970688172043012,764,26,143,9,19,239,130,186,0.077,0.7709999999999999,0.152,0.9215,0,0,4,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,1,7,8,2,0,11,0,15,16,4,2,2,31,32,17,0,5,5,0,2,2,0,4,2,3,0,0,4,10,8,1,5,6,0,3,2,3,0,1,8,8,17,5,20,17,4,27,0,0,3,2,3,9,2,5,17,90,21,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09567179647960293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395234262750255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13217980805410254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15627123449592872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1445240191970514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11232690110362427,0.0,0.0,0.18146259614797733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14399882312934295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4134582877371421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11853463249862704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07113543467343496,0.0,0.13508131739095744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26012521815792783,0.0,0.0,0.07995550721412252,0.1180013490158455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15856416242657434,0.0,0.09429934535738496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2293569140694073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13746485369260394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11960682149774465,0.0,0.0,0.09390948053015538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13499270574657793,0.16017276741498954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13299442787858098,0.0,0.0,0.1431289758084324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12014569335351315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210910402942732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407883259844544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1176204005603195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18029274375144788,0.27644798348918576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910341009669616,0.0,0.13743048648918094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08298067471449988,0.0,0.11285040367191215,0.0,0.0,0.13041800236388634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525687505752073,0.10242161043539927,0.0,0.0,0.19987962405584586,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,cwalker216,2019/04/15,"Tapering Off Whiskey After 10 Years - Help! &amp;#x200B;

Hey Guys,

So I'm sort of new to this Sub in the sense that I've read a lot of posts but never actually posted.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I'm about to start an alcohol taper.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a short story long, here's my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Brief History: 35 years old, very active, married, 2 kids.  

&amp;#x200B;

**My Drinking Habits:**  I've been drinking daily for about 10 years now.  I won't get into the history to much, but I used to (like 2 - 3 years back) drink to blackout about once or twice a week, and then just in moderation (ie about 10 drinks / daily) the rest of the weekdays.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last year or so, I've been drinking around 7 - 8 a night.  A drink for me is really about 3 drinks, with about 2.5 shots of whiskey mixed with diet coke.  

&amp;#x200B;

In total, it's about 350 ml of whiskey per night, spread out over 4 hours or so.

&amp;#x200B;

There are days that I will have an occasional couple of beers during the day, almost exclusively on the weekends.  

&amp;#x200B;

Compounding this problem has been Adderall use.  I'm prescribed 10 mg Adderall XR, which I take daily.

&amp;#x200B;

When I think about it, my ADHD was caused by my drinking, which is why I started taking the Adderall in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I've put myself in a constant cycle of dependency with the adderall / alcohol....I wake up hungover, and Adderall lifts the fog.  I struggle to fall asleep at night because of the Adderall, so I drink whiskey.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence the cycle....

&amp;#x200B;

Other than my hangover (which I realize is technically 'withdrawal'), I do not experience any other alcohol withdrawal symptoms. (such as shakes, raised BP, etc.).  With that said, I haven't gone through a period of more than 16 - 18 hours or so until I have my next drink.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ready and willing to get myself out of this cycle, which is where the taper has come in.

&amp;#x200B;

My Plan:  I am going to do a quick taper off of the adderall.  I've tapered off it before in the past, and while the first week sucks, life does seem to get normal eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the whiskey, I was thinking about doing it over the course of about 2 weeks, dropping by about 50 ml every few days.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest concern is, given my history of drinking everyday for close to 10 years, is an at-home taper safe?

&amp;#x200B;

Is a 2 week taper realistic?  Should I make it shorter / longer?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I have access to Ativan and clonidine, but I don't plan on taking either unless absolutely necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated, thanks for listening!

My family is dysfunctional and one of the many problems is alcoholism and related behavior. Since the smartphone, I notice that the ability to connect anytime is attractive for some who like to conduct manipulative and/or hurtful communication and emotional dumpstering.

Drunk late night phonecalls are proverbial - has anyone noticed how texting/digitals have become a similar tool?

However, it's really only a ""weekend thing"". In the past, he could drink on weekends without becoming fully drunk. 


Lately it's increased, and he gets drunk every weekend. He becomes a different person and creates chaos when he drinks. During the work week he's normal and we have a normal relationship, but as soon as he arrives home on Friday nights he starts to make himself a drink. 

It's gotten to a point where I dread the weekends because we can't have a normal time together without him needing alcohol there.",5.400421146953407,6.9462625725806495,6.1510752688172055,75.50216845878137,68.43548387096774,8.736917562724015,33.132616487455195,9.150863307647796,3.1788057347670264,525,24,88,10,9,172,83,124,0.055,0.889,0.055,-0.4583,2,0,6,0,0,0,15.0,3,0,0,2,4,1,0,1,11,0,8,9,0,1,0,15,14,7,0,5,3,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,1,2,4,6,8,0,0,9,0,1,3,1,0,1,4,0,8,0,12,9,2,21,0,0,0,0,17,6,0,0,14,53,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4202599846083886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090706220774822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07990629531450047,0.2895392682389902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465821223196786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13695266168682793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852310070153237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1104421345465156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149817726875012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06848487031610187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13148580998801654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14786606632415447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09258700599089573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749817049481247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719555056298376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230114614548396,0.3852972232372326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969367392630396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419488985170806,0.1251324834337089,0.0,0.11445563857933272,0.0,0.0,0.12391474278939735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08397440669022684,0.0,0.0,0.28146575888094805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10843228288236482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09278042692886593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08708497424920128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07643489637524442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10514597466783628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527165027403793,0.0,0.09542916733899012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844124308392295

I feel like my time is coming up unless I do something but I'm literally to tired and worn out to think about it.",2.8929885057471227,5.468860827586205,4.184597701149425,82.27850574712646,78.65517241379311,7.085057471264367,25.75862068965517,8.167268648758528,1.9421862068965523,360,14,65,7,9,118,60,87,0.219,0.7609999999999999,0.02,-0.9262,0,0,2,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,1,2,0,5,2,0,0,0,17,15,7,1,0,3,1,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,8,1,2,3,1,0,3,0,5,0,0,3,3,8,1,12,12,0,18,0,0,1,0,1,6,0,1,10,37,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785858368535943,0.2153039355572872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15491351612101856,0.1682141722501264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3470870984710241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20373268196388866,0.1439260479776185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17907061683224082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642201929489705,0.22726036630371474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09842522031086448,0.0,0.0,0.17828945653369604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19457535710912804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3871893308378478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16054086505085613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.155096965752854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12909010956261066,0.0,0.0,0.2349507629498219,0.23155343435994505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33245808936874705,0.0,0.0,0.16160241029195596,0.0,0.0,0.1867593100396832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,validati0n,2019/04/16,"Struggling through school I’m a university student, and for the past few weeks I have been drinking a 12 pack every night to cope with the stress of school. Historically I have had a very high tolerance but I don’t normally get hangovers. 

My classes are structured so they start at 2pm which allows me to sleep in after the drinking the night before and get some homework done in the morning. I feel like I have a problem and I feel addicted to it but it hasn’t really affected aspects of my life other than what I believe might affect my health in the long term. 

Should I be worried about my health?

alcoholism,andyx1234,2019/04/16,"Relative wants to keep doing therapy and thinks AA will lead to finding a drinking buddy. How can I help? My relative has been doing therapy on and off for a few years. They insist that working thru their childhood issues will solve alcohol abuse, which has not improved during the time they have gone to therapy. Not sure about the type of therapy, or if alcohol abuse was discussed, but I know meds are involved.

Since the family members have not noticed an improvement in alcohol abuse (with meds, the alcohol is probably affecting negatively their mind/health).

They believe AA is for loners, that it's depressing to attend AA meetings and that they will only find a drinking buddy.

How can family members help? Or convince them to attend a few mtgs? Or do anything else to help.  They are aware they have a problem which seems like a positive, but they seem stuck on avoiding AA.",6.6256022727272725,8.1099130375,6.7502272727272725,72.57386363636367,65.5,10.31818181818182,35.17045454545455,10.436869588844218,4.099499999999999,706,33,113,18,11,226,96,160,0.177,0.71,0.113,-0.8983,0,1,6,0,3,0,20.0,0,0,10,2,3,6,0,1,11,0,19,6,0,4,1,28,27,11,0,3,9,0,0,1,0,3,4,0,0,0,6,4,6,2,6,2,0,4,4,3,4,0,4,0,13,3,16,20,2,11,0,1,0,0,16,4,0,6,4,82,19,3,0.0,0.3738776602701746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4496389980383068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655750208821231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11850639296810113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09059485892694268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20608062907662394,0.0,0.0,0.08786776791939084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19831630223665608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19227261271306706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11180571515530802,0.0,0.0,0.2115079330881214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10978480936456553,0.0,0.09349240705022628,0.0,0.0,0.05780639720254045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051387608554072726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23367151125031324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10620589510043046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975272590548527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07999720166687663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340618460921754,0.10064692020145427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915111978966632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08700932425614685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09913471224433347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48114846330728495,0.0,0.0,0.06739768524219962,0.0,0.0,0.06133365918721478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06204027160741795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0765752333509406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677350727191469
alcoholism,MorganthSilvermoon,2019/04/16,"Am I an alcoholic? I didn’t drink until I was about 26 years old. I’m 36 now and at first I would just have a few shots to goto sleep. A coping mechanism, I know. The last few years, I’ve been drinking every day. Nothing too hard core like Everclear but nothing as basic as things like low grade Vodka or whiskey. My drink of choice has always been Sailor Jerry. 

I’ve had the occasional black out, usually when I eat first because it takes more to get me to where I want then it all processes at once and it’s too much. So I watch it a lot more now with eating. 

My typical routine is to have a few shots a day. I’d say anywhere from 4-8. Usually ramping up toward bed time. I’m not a disruptive or angry drunk as I just get sleepy and go to sleep. 

On my normal routine, I’ll finish a 750ml in about 3 days. I usually make a 1750 last about a week. My wife would very much like to quit and I wouldn’t mind it either but the relaxation that it brings is so hard to resist. 

The longest I’ve gone without drinking was about 2 weeks when I did Nutrisystem because it was too many empty calories. But eventually that voice starts coming back to persuade me that it’s okay and it always wins. 

How do you I break the cycle?",1.0707571168988466,3.16214548818898,2.853858267716536,92.00190793458508,82.30708661417323,5.954936402180498,20.792852816474863,7.1686216300943375,0.5007382192610539,950,28,208,13,26,315,148,254,0.033,0.841,0.126,0.967,0,0,7,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,4,18,7,0,0,15,1,18,11,2,2,1,29,31,20,0,5,10,1,2,3,0,3,1,2,1,0,13,8,9,0,1,8,0,4,4,1,0,2,9,6,20,6,27,19,10,39,0,1,2,0,3,9,0,3,28,131,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11776519172608363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.183382523072336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08473333234588906,0.0,0.13434798266509104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09492343600522443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21320042747104614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4317975068910361,0.0,0.2255144675633878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09284423660959264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18746401804681054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11514492235981573,0.0,0.06262649044880589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1974265687040338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060560418284459835,0.1796476451568086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16150747422134604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368404660457813,0.0,0.0,0.0735561738070658,0.1117206705874838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112657723507956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16201235118131194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10796793182282582,0.211470596376963,0.0,0.1156313603565968,0.11735432692048894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720619465347985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08763167231300252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2205496296573164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779967531947201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08285310136218599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07320881643162895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642557266158596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36409344314553777,0.0909226079264597,0.06499600357141112,0.0,0.17678393831649858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10622427242971463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565590639469214,0.0,0.0,0.1419242345108325
alcoholism,Paranoiadestroyer,2019/04/16,"New subreddit for people experiencing mental health issues (mostly) in the UK! Hello all! I'd like to introduce [my new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/). As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population. I'm hoping it can be a sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy. Thanks for reading if you got this far 🙂",9.816923076923079,9.518142615384617,9.185512820512825,63.938653846153876,58.74358974358975,11.902564102564106,36.80769230769232,11.20814326018867,4.330015384615384,712,27,109,16,8,227,109,156,0.018000000000000002,0.8029999999999999,0.179,0.9777,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,1,1,2,3,6,7,0,0,7,0,10,2,0,0,1,27,18,12,0,11,12,0,0,3,0,2,2,0,0,0,8,5,0,0,3,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,6,7,19,14,5,8,0,0,0,0,16,4,0,10,7,71,14,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085427795352152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147262740457332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13745506756002765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15228403365850648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06788620126699108,0.12464645876717136,0.0,0.0,0.10392169547468698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4143477012544962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12905577423200695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27123886782640444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1904405105568082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928348043544123,0.0,0.13119832748385918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2509860124102452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14793300631359213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988221892217795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3603250699012302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14555806620800765,0.0,0.1299711705251785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11009435791678976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14744984206258538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20887528267747815,0.0,0.11962761870955085,0.14859314917889366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882180202057626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09459496135152784,0.0,0.0,0.18460562406843145,0.0,0.0,0.08367452903010872
alcoholism,yeronyms,2019/04/16,"memory lost lately after drinking Hey.. I like alcohol. I am trying to drink only Friday/Saturday.  I am drunk almost every wknd for almost two years but I still like it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently (4-6 months?) I suffer with lost memory the next day.. I dont remember half of the night, how I get home and when and what I did before I felt asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its so weird. My GF told me that I was very ugly on her and she was afraid of me. Thats the reason she broke up with me. The worst part on this that I dont feel shame because I dont remember it. I dont believe it that it happend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I heard that three weeks ago I was in one club (I came there maybe in 2 a.m.? I was drunk but not that much atm) and I was kissing with one girl. I remember that I met her but I dont remember kissing etc. and home coming (in my mind - I was in club and then nothing - and morning opening my eyes) 

&amp;#x200B;

Its so weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I overcome this memory leaking?",0.7308545454545481,2.9352379400000044,2.705454545454547,91.85772727272727,84.6,5.636363636363638,20.590909090909093,6.980632752743323,0.4880499999999999,748,23,160,10,22,250,109,200,0.16699999999999998,0.7440000000000001,0.08900000000000001,-0.9453,0,0,3,0,0,0,52.0,0,0,0,2,7,13,0,2,4,0,15,9,2,3,0,29,25,16,0,0,4,0,2,2,1,0,1,1,2,1,16,13,5,0,7,6,1,2,6,9,0,5,14,4,33,4,15,11,4,24,0,4,1,2,10,8,0,2,16,111,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061996662518214736,0.07474347163673152,0.14006751879952192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3788941351908739,0.42491741930344495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0426341369830939,0.0,0.05951289829199291,0.07879725077430236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07999153100315007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06024621573427245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045104839186228686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4098396638824498,0.13702709703980048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07800042082517332,0.0,0.0,0.058926584875809776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035363236385875164,0.0,0.06715236337756944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03654021664793986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14030894592969276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889418602130148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0683372799814588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526932593419807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07026307935586573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07061840581200135,0.0,0.0558246055311158,0.0,0.05141317819736753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438087062588601,0.06563297018732513,0.0,0.06710831227222203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947848900283894,0.0531917258057468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07573707128026852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07190889264816112,0.06905627921162415,0.0,0.31690880271544103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05585333871293608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06629395029426399,0.06682966736170358,0.0,0.047483958601441084,0.0,0.0683201951693093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05770696134470602,0.0,0.0,0.05610080994952553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42491741930344495,0.0450383930992052

alcoholism,undercovermf,2019/04/16,"I get sick every time I drink, dull pain upper right abdomen Anybody experience this?

I'm 29, and I was an on and off heavy drinker for years, mostly vodka. For a while I drank everyday, then cut down to only on weekends. About a month ago, I just had enough and stopped. I get this dull ache in my upper right abdomen every time I drink even a little bit, and get extremely tired for a whole day.

Those symptoms get better the longer I go without drinking, but I tried having pne a couple nights ago, and they came back almost instantly.

I think I'm done with alcohol.

alcoholism,ThinkTide,2019/04/16,"Do I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol? For a long time I've wondered if I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I started drinking as a way to rebel when I was 17 and the first time I drank, I got so drunk I was awake but my vision went black. About 3 years ago when I was struggling a lot mentally, I started getting blackout drunk maybe 3-5x/week and started using it as a crutch. I felt 10x better drunk than sober, but after maybe 6 months I realized I was gaining a massive amount of weight and was feeling the lowest I'd ever been. So I stopped drinking for a few years.

Then when I was 20 going into 21 I had another bout of depression and used alcohol as a crutch again. I was on that bender for several months and then eventually stopped and got back up on my feet again. 

Now I realize I have a pattern. I drink when I'm upset and once I get going, I don't stop. I've drank myself into huge panic attacks, just to do it again the next day. Last night -- well I guess this morning -- I noticed I had the shakes for the first time ever. 

However I dated a recovering alcoholic awhile ago and I remember him telling me that when you're an alcoholic you don't get to shut it off, which makes me skeptical if I actually do have a problem with it. He said that a normal person will be able to do what I'm able to do, stop intermittently if I want, but an actual alcoholic won't ever be able to stop. 

What do you guys think?",4.358886708296165,4.7964619627118665,5.825263157894738,80.95239964317574,70.0508474576271,9.1935771632471,30.102586975914363,9.276330184999452,2.4496779661016945,1129,43,235,22,19,384,149,295,0.17600000000000002,0.737,0.087,-0.9827,2,0,9,0,0,0,29.0,0,2,0,4,18,11,3,4,20,0,26,16,1,3,3,43,51,26,0,6,7,0,3,0,0,2,6,1,0,2,11,13,15,5,7,6,0,4,3,9,1,2,17,5,36,2,27,30,3,54,0,1,1,0,10,8,0,6,41,157,47,0,0.24079715702017745,0.0,0.15665552656279844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14230143388620853,0.5146778595258322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08416560487551633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09131384290557512,0.0,0.06171938340901961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709885057369806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05176474854208021,0.0,0.06913274616598274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358895414446628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2178148144221594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04058475924481012,0.0,0.07706767759206648,0.0,0.0,0.13654795916671886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12580657600689862,0.0,0.0912337156714853,0.0,0.1283916558053071,0.0,0.08842173872308395,0.07947568117502417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06542727391328962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710326355060759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06823904397024398,0.0,0.0,0.05357799071051212,0.0,0.16127540637631196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08088896606019116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12813466226308245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08536350275838155,0.0753239399388889,0.07864336260080032,0.0,0.0913830530867609,0.0,0.08548037115248064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417452703911523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.070084929843565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680345296730483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17235068721288008,0.09092541276782312,0.0,0.07635107944010078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067741574901962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17043746711504704,0.0,0.0,0.3355286757530255,0.0,0.08391115706184175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015577626665212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05143103175182601,0.0,0.0,0.14041075869790662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13864762013646195,0.0,0.0,0.04734280068323732,0.06371119168584713,0.06438431823366032,0.09774202203959358,0.07216852091237964,0.07440712566706273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870447483564562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10337698285072418
alcoholism,pazuzu_lives,2019/04/17,"While I don’t feel as though I need drinking to “function”, it increasingly feels that I’m only happy when I do it. Is this a sign of dependence? I get drunk on average four nights of the week (almost always alone.) I don’t need it to start my day, nor does it interfere with my work beyond waking up hungover. However, when I drink it feels like I become a ‘regular’ person - with a broader range of emotion and dopamine rushes.

Any advice appreciated!",0.0593522267206481,2.1783510350877187,2.631754385964914,91.8131781376518,86.89473684210527,5.2620782726045885,19.29554655870445,6.67199483983844,0.13753117408906898,414,12,93,5,13,143,73,114,0.063,0.732,0.205,0.9554,0,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,1,2,0,3,7,3,0,0,5,0,15,2,0,3,0,22,26,7,0,3,5,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,4,3,1,0,6,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,1,0,19,3,13,22,3,8,0,0,0,0,17,3,0,4,3,69,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2067117769238757,0.0,0.18529266586522625,0.0,0.2026441404288361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1289468472363239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15603958450987052,0.0,0.35453475548145924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1633392500270507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15976147319730655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17330755784633495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09906765944313342,0.0,0.1077643668647983,0.1590427114899047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2084183573667461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1612065740124372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14059945880188976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4248314580332125,0.2016822477029829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12149965685703472,0.0,0.0,0.1105678706657864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12873827993585882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2236834005361014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13804427470249714,0.38513288003766144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221078745210338

I’m going to down half a pint of cheap booze before going in in a Coke cup because I’m an irresponsible loser who deserves no sympathy. I’m not even an actively bad person as in I don’t proactively hurt people. I just exist to be a hedonist. I’m not a sad case of any sort just one long reign of nothing that just does nothing.

Ofcourse every now and then il still drink on a night out but I've noticed that liquor, cocktails and flavored drinks would make my stomach upset just after a few drinks or shots.
Beer now makes me gassy and a big ""burp"" would build up but i cant get it out lol makin me feel nauseous. Why was i able to outdrink every one i know and after half a year of almost not drinking i suddenly cant drink  even 1/8th of what i could easily drink back then?!?!? 
 my tolerance is still high but i get nauseous from alcohol in general now without getting to drunk or even tipsy...",1.343224533715926,3.5401906036585373,2.778450502152083,92.32494261119085,81.98780487804878,5.810043041606886,21.842180774748925,7.048011613610866,0.5917687230989959,625,20,134,8,17,203,104,164,0.032,0.8190000000000001,0.149,0.9639,0,0,11,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,1,11,1,0,1,5,1,10,13,1,3,0,31,22,13,0,3,9,0,2,0,0,3,3,2,0,0,4,9,12,0,4,10,0,0,4,1,0,2,4,5,18,0,17,14,2,24,0,0,0,0,4,8,0,4,16,83,22,0,0.22202259064972354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2372746280231303,0.11116177671946273,0.0,0.12250372486171453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08536083378650018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08863348624558888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971467326307044,0.0,0.0,0.6524928418610544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466438271792199,0.0,0.1870636083782072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11226129286492796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1739964599549806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251177978863127,0.0,0.0744085312385791,0.117289528453764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11991124858477074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201780942872376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22230270493854196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417658055100054,0.0,0.0,0.12638709550526644,0.0,0.0,0.07522412670703077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11293839662645687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118074177228429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882806377094666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17730752769114133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09159594468636753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20034085465650547,0.0,0.0,0.10701092724585498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15771847825823862,0.0,0.0,0.1429752690818516
alcoholism,Amyfckingj_,2019/04/17,"Alcoholic Hepatitis- What is the long term prognosis? Hey guys, recovering alcoholic here - 4 months sober, getting close to 5. My question actually isnt about me, it’s for my brother, who unfortunately also struggles with alcoholism (it runs on my mom’s side of the family).

Turns out he has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis. I have been reading loads about it, but I was wondering if anyone out there had experience or knows about this topic and could fill me in on how serious this is for him. From what I have read so far...Its a pretty bad outlook.

I guess moreover, I want advice as well on how to convince him that if he doesnt stop, he will die. Quickly. If anyone has any input or can give me personal experiences, please let me know.

alcoholism,CC0093,2019/04/17,"A cycle. Round and round we go. I'm not sure at what point I am in alcoholism. Just know that i've long been in one and stumbling down a path that would otherwise be happy and exciting is upsetting to me. Sometimes, i seem to have a grip. When a buzz turns into a trip, I can sometimes get too far, which rarely happens. I'm a common drinker at home. Usually every night  ranging from just a couple to where ever it takes me. I work second shift. A future fiánce, two daughters and three dogs which i try to give all my fullest attention. When getting off work early, I like to come home and wind down. Sometimes this can be 5 nights a week, sometimes not until the weekend. When work is light I tend to atleast drink a few each night. Sometimes, like tonight, I finish a 12PK of budweiser. Totally ok, I go to bed. Wake up and presume my normal routine. I'm finishing the last as we speak about to go to bed. I'm a single supporter with my future wife going through school. I'm a full time dad. Change diapers, prep the kids for day care in the mornings and play with them. Everything as far as family life is normal. I know alcohol is taking a toll on my life. Some I don't notice, some I do. I'd like to quit for good but alcohol plays such a good crutch in moderation.  I never let it interfere with my home life, but I feel it does as far as my attitude with life goes. Alcohol can bring an otherwise happy man to his knees. I don't feel I am being the best I can for my family. It seems like once a year I do something to act out and ne a road block in the progression of my family. I enjoy it. I'd say it is probably in my best interest tp quit but I have no clue where to start.

Before my family was started I'd lost a job, tested friends, spent time in jail as well as got hit by a car at 55mph. It had consumed me at some point.  I've controlled it to a point after learning how to walk again but I just enjoy in moderation.",1.5301936264622815,3.357225194029855,3.4413271480435665,89.74149052037113,79.39800995024876,7.032513110125049,22.805163372327552,8.00916892397051,1.113694957644212,1496,48,329,27,37,504,211,402,0.033,0.805,0.162,0.994,1,0,7,0,0,0,47.0,2,0,1,10,15,24,0,1,27,1,25,11,2,2,5,51,58,24,0,3,9,3,5,4,1,1,8,3,5,2,14,18,5,3,9,4,1,10,6,2,1,4,6,9,38,22,56,46,11,68,0,1,2,0,13,29,0,5,33,205,52,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3283072514851017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06535191515159264,0.0,0.16119562718756467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830364313714132,0.0,0.081245176105341,0.06615718091149403,0.0,0.0,0.08613874764652744,0.0,0.08497874275216681,0.0,0.04953023139559045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672089912150984,0.0,0.0,0.0752356503902527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06947081726184827,0.06470807649264103,0.0,0.06902370300632316,0.0,0.28960423982822936,0.0,0.07766569231552163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593361901887149,0.0,0.08025060807089833,0.07367442811101499,0.17459090116567505,0.12883391389331894,0.06142470117603618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679147883678745,0.16351198708871564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2311127148710981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07621304956329125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844155398736356,0.06260298963634618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853413076647267,0.21698700737661575,0.15008417506830765,0.0,0.0,0.06796638585802331,0.0,0.0,0.08383726230049729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059233594057615975,0.0,0.0,0.2162173455803364,0.15049716484871895,0.0,0.08743834158381683,0.0,0.08179045938031672,0.052042282165425634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21780504391478828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08280436735447998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16337443628170564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06107516376112838,0.0,0.07772661802769701,0.0,0.1398333224751033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05912509031500032,0.3797903037872769,0.0,0.1087201544480174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715275906323272,0.07238394588925487,0.0,0.11548944805569003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08956645290612865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05214277446811268,0.08353733281477806,0.0750233264718292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08458534864365977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061605054987723465,0.0,0.06905323875690997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16773592483943614,0.0,0.0,0.05455716076428471,0.0,0.0,0.049457266052514576

alcoholism,IamStuckInsideMyHead,2019/04/18,"How much is alcohol able to change my face/features? Hello!  
I've been a bit more on the alco side lately... well, past 3 years. Usually beers, wine, ocassional hard liquors.  
I am 26F and I have noticed my face going a bit into more... masculine features? I do not know how to say it.   
Sunken and dull eyes, weird face, swollen face in general (and also nose).   
I am thinking this could have something to do with alcohol in general, but I am not sure if I am just jugding my face poorly... Has anyone had any experience with face being changed (even dramatically) by alcohol consumption? In terms of facial features? Any pictures?  


I guess this question is a bit dumb, but I am curious...",2.4597879464285697,5.079663617187503,3.924151785714287,83.21281250000001,80.796875,7.4071428571428575,27.892857142857146,8.418075326091056,2.3960294642857147,525,24,98,12,14,173,84,128,0.103,0.885,0.013,-0.8749,0,0,6,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,0,6,5,1,0,4,0,16,15,8,2,1,22,20,9,0,2,6,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,3,6,6,0,3,3,1,1,2,3,1,0,2,4,11,2,12,16,7,12,0,1,1,0,3,6,1,3,5,63,14,0,0.15012991308423893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48132965899502295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005883725302224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2041869781427317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049743259228469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4917089453442102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3176350830540943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119866519415554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09915939168320777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14685586266810166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08532228935097769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16538502505835065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344869136033267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825074739946799,0.0,0.16935308115775366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036276028611214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17092390110077013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14331598959266045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16817986149904215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11938933265807213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11557734177618055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14149566636735422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619718632418116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16534688906792924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13498482174047122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966787418237018

alcoholism,jasondyer84,2019/04/18,Beer and adderall. I’m going through a breakup that I stayed sober for a bulk of. She was almost at 2 years sober and I had built up 6 months completely sober for the first half of our relationship. The year prior to her and I getting together and had been drinking once a month maybe and didn’t touch any form up uppers for at least six months before. The year BEFORE that I was self medicating with booze and adderall and occasionally cocaine. My life has been a series of ebbs and flows with drug and alcohol use. Right now I’m drinking 6-10 beers every night and for the past four days have taken at least 10 mg of adderall. The self medicating really does work while the substances are active in my body but as soon as I wake up or as soon as they wear off its right back into my head with all the negative thoughts and compulsions. Idk what I’m doing here with this post besides expressing concern for myself out loud. I hope this is just a short cycle of use this time around. I try to stay conscious of my brain chemistry and body and try not to pickle it or pollute it too bad.,5.051474654377881,5.674262788018434,5.245783410138252,85.06010368663598,68.5852534562212,8.227649769585254,27.481566820276488,8.192908349453996,1.5691806451612904,863,26,178,11,14,272,134,217,0.07400000000000001,0.899,0.027000000000000003,-0.9032,0,0,7,0,0,0,12.0,1,0,1,2,8,2,0,0,12,0,12,16,6,2,1,32,22,21,0,1,5,0,1,0,0,0,5,1,0,2,9,20,6,0,2,4,0,2,3,1,0,4,9,2,16,1,34,13,4,37,0,0,0,0,8,15,0,4,17,117,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337099340379181,0.12528464553106966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08508252151717742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137891668612727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09620574732416816,0.1044658371784516,0.0,0.0,0.21292737762309472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2779492214165835,0.0,0.1396697691352783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13118074510091535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068885402718863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094890197091321,0.0,0.0,0.2451302261640617,0.1450937317221093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10541482224853282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064227940367304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06536744749391905,0.0,0.07110576380169427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284041326755113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12426747098014042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08837245693529598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12569488010451,0.0,0.0,0.25208049173269464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.299596907655146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11741199495137135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13324344045650108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11943646827222668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198256288769422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08015190208903426,0.0,0.0,0.13432673618322252,0.0,0.2136951309809649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26104455867999216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667119834582169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993273708736482,0.07295558935061912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16988980665269945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21611845700967264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108524345052614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24170996229893185

alcoholism,ikilIed2pac,2019/04/18,"After some self-reflection I’m starting to realize I(22) have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I’ve always just considered myself a social drinker. I thought what I was doing was normal, but I’m starting to fear I’m losing control.

I really never drink by myself, just on the weekends, most weeks, Thurs-Sun. I hate the depression I have the next day after drinking, but I continue to do it.

I’ve ruined relationships with great women due to my drunken antics. I’ve even put my career in jeopardy twice because of alcohol.  I put alcohol above my health and passions, but I continue to drink.

I genuinely know my life would be better without it, so I try to stop, but as soon as the weekend rolls around I find myself getting plastered yet again. I guess I just normalized this kind of behavior because my friends are always drinking, but deep down I hate it. I hate the person I am when I’m drunk, and I regret drinking every. single. fucking. time.

Last time I went an extensive amount of time without drinking was about 6 weeks last August. I don’t feel as if I’m addicted because I really don’t crave alcohol until it’s time to drink socially but idk. Maybe I’m in denial, hoping I just have shit willpower. I just know something needs to change.

What should I do? No one really friend or family wise I feel like I can turn too.",3.3144186046511663,5.627208368217055,4.7017248062015495,80.50049418604654,75.7829457364341,7.710852713178295,27.80426356589147,8.59863814320734,2.401547286821706,1061,44,188,22,24,352,145,258,0.205,0.677,0.118,-0.9778,1,0,13,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,3,14,19,5,1,8,0,17,18,1,1,1,40,40,16,0,8,15,0,2,1,2,2,7,0,0,2,7,5,12,2,7,10,0,3,6,10,0,2,5,2,33,9,28,32,4,36,0,4,0,2,8,6,2,6,28,122,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08818877724624109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3458136585438153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134624204926663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0720147514487477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14794068196990634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07154609751256966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08557743230139862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907319449426778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05217134391625871,0.0,0.06967576154975291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5547322143413015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05343116413480322,0.0,0.06815852092218773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07626171920645591,0.09103069330874912,0.08180707883081165,0.0577922473665721,0.0,0.0,0.07393764323175901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12500037644853718,0.07478721513904864,0.04226491533742826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918832436384642,0.08911626291095671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396046901601412,0.0,0.08598885677765612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034816015510704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424092313762879,0.08891685014449936,0.13188236801956746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057139364526636476,0.0395217874682378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09050213330857697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08127108629198831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05998349265696702,0.06239212133483112,0.0,0.08603400549089298,0.0,0.15852216160741395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054817345377496406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063542432246414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626460097428077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15547249368618896,0.0,0.0,0.1737044461730009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439235884904764,0.0,0.0830387665634739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16492693662910216,0.0,0.0622778318208777,0.0,0.0,0.11451746556631776,0.0,0.0,0.06763282901779356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06422253096320782,0.18868485311946412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05492319625557024,0.08799181423801615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12978007250055712,0.0,0.0,0.07499156959761813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15596206203491642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0574663254567697,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Passerbye,2019/04/18,"Finally Quit :) Unfortunately to late. I just figured id write this because maybe this will help someone.

So I've drank since I was probably 15 pretty steady. Then when I was a little older I started drinking with my stepfather. Drinking vodka and rum and shots and always beer. Love my beers. But he was abusive to my mother and I ended moving back to Florida.

Long story short, I quit drinking the hard stuff because I became a totally different person when I would drink it. An asshole I think they call it lol

Anyways throughout my life I was always the guy with a beer in his hand but you'd never really see me drunk. It would take a lot to get me there. Usually work days id have about 9 beers a night at least, then eat right before bed so id end up with heartburn or would even throw up. Then on the weekends I could easily drink 20 beers a day. Especially if went fishing and kayaking.  Usually barely eating anything for those days.

So fast forward and I'm 50 now. I can tell things are definitely not right in my belly. So I actually stop drinking. After I think 4 days I find it hard to go to the bathroom. And then, I simply cant. Turns out I guess beer is kinda a natural laxative so it was enabling the stool to pass the what I come to find out is a tumor.

So I haven't gone to the bathroom in days. Make the appointment to have to have a colonoscopy its 5 days away counting the weekend! so it was like 9-10 days total.

 At this point I'm barely eating. I mean, you cant have trains pull into the station without any departures. Monday is prep day where you have to start drinking 64  fluid ounces of Gatorade with miralax amongst other things. They say be prepared to spend the day on the toilet...nothing. And now I've drunk 64 ounces of this drink and just ready to burst so I give up and go to the hospital.

After my first C-scan the doctor comes in really doesn't say much and leaves. Now I get a male nurse and he starts talking a bit about cancer, and there not sure, and more tests. Then he gets an emergency and runs out. So I'm just laying there another guy comes in and says I'm being admitted and there sending me upstairs. He says has anyone told you what's going on and I said, not really...so he says...I just wanna say good luck to you bro. And the way he said it I instantly understood how bad it was. They all had seen the C-scan and new it was cancer that had spread which makes it stage 4.

Still with me? 

So that night I end up having surgery. They give me a colostomy bag so I can go to the bathroom. It was decided to do chemo first and do minimal surgery, so I could recover quicker.

Nothing like waking up to having a colostomy bag. Its just horrible. Horrible.

I think I haven't really freaked about this because that cancer is in a good spot so when they do surgery again they can just cut out the tumor and reconnect the colon and get rid of the bag altogether. So hopefully temporary.

Day after surgery two interns I guess, are showing me how to change the bag. They seem to be learning themselves and I'm just humiliated this is all happening, and then all of a sudden I swear it feels like a 150 degrees. I say I think I'm having a stroke. And it is just so hot and I'm begging for them to get me ice and let me have water. I'm begging. So she comes back with 3 big ice packs and I put them behind my neck and on my chest and its still so hot. And they cant give you a drink in case you have to have emergency surgery so its just torture. So the doctors comes in and throws the bag on. I couldn't see at this point, I honestly don't know if its all because all my levels and numbers where plunging or because I basically would keep a towel over my head and try to sleep through it all.  And I was also on morphine lol

My hands and feet feel so weird. I remember thinking I don't even know if I can think of a word to describe this feeling, and I cant. I remember thinking if there was a switch to shut myself off...id switch it. Just the absolute worse feeling ever. And the intern is screaming, he's turning gray! The buzzers are going off and there people everywhere sticking needles and different things in me, and then I wake up in the ICU

Was never told what happen. I think it was sepsis  Lost over 20lbs. I would say all muscle. Had no idea how quickly you can go to shit,,,

Not sure how many days I stayed in ICU I think 4-5 days.  

Cant say enough about nurses. I kept telling them how important they are. I really was impressed!

So now home maybe four days and it was my first day of chemo today. I now have to wear the colostomy bag and a pump that pumps through a tube into a port that delivers the chemo straight into an artery. Makes sleeping fun! Luckily you wear it for 3 days then they take it off and you have like 2 weeks between before they put it on again.

So far the only side effect I'm feeling I've never heard of before. Extreme sensitivity to cold. As I type this I have Pepsi with ice in it. When you take a sip it burns your lips and feels very rough in the back of the throat. Like drinking fine glass shards. She said it will get so bad you will put on an oven mitt to get something outta the freezer.  If you hold the Pepsi with ice it feels like that hand has been working out in winter weather without gloves and it just aches. How crazy!

So I have 9 spots of cancer on my liver. The big spot (the tumor in the colon) and cancer in the omentum. 

Never heard of that organ before, but this one worries my cancer doctor the most it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

So looking at 6 months chemo and surgery during or after the chemo. I think 2 outta 3 beat this.

Surprisingly pretty calm about it. Already talked to the kids about it a bit. I look at it like, there are little kids that have to go through this. At least I got to 50

And im 90% percent sure this was caused by my drinking and poor diet so...

So if I sound anything like you with the drinking, you should really think about things. They can change fast.",1.6758374417967659,3.7962642497945778,2.9770823746918684,91.78179995206793,80.29005751848808,5.798655162969049,22.138379895918927,6.9256773072597895,0.5539077019994529,4660,146,992,53,120,1507,450,1217,0.111,0.7909999999999999,0.098,-0.9775,3,0,20,0,0,0,135.0,0,16,15,11,82,31,3,0,72,2,86,58,19,11,17,186,178,110,0,17,29,2,16,8,0,9,12,15,3,6,66,73,26,4,34,25,2,25,22,9,0,6,35,38,117,22,126,126,19,172,0,1,6,1,77,67,1,18,87,643,183,8,0.0,0.044081950914587165,0.03630680348287786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04105674485231891,0.029752899114001943,0.0619152349695699,0.040311702292869886,0.04520825981480542,0.025300738788059045,0.03901278356761895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026014665810568646,0.0,0.06123324226835975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03495540921869926,0.08582525903868647,0.0621293965340296,0.1133993956326426,0.0,0.1266351740875638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08123665017925928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03799055932793837,0.0,0.0,0.03821987871926919,0.07871610951269807,0.1602444645737618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05941047807753539,0.0,0.0,0.3599131024409461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774280614283358,0.0,0.11424296638644685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4373619195088832,0.0,0.11421029398791395,0.0,0.0,0.09885800697317784,0.03844280620861693,0.0,0.04914722555139549,0.033654136292534866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13168408896157066,0.05315865118119088,0.0,0.04075636037768825,0.06800956122688928,0.09493989828951356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360668771160408,0.10707154497307092,0.14801158063189493,0.06241173298601126,0.02975631130572293,0.0,0.08197120808620728,0.07367778210959562,0.06580068103693705,0.0,0.06665691029741418,0.0,0.03818315868170997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024937789323113867,0.0,0.03731974140015922,0.036953051779106974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04200002093106248,0.040187884438822735,0.0,0.0,0.03306959577763878,0.0,0.0,0.04089389179642509,0.0,0.041968964997661486,0.039394821076895896,0.0,0.03804472791026309,0.026279057191875944,0.1454122315579941,0.07457855383650973,0.0,0.03292533617901006,0.06248581489156101,0.0,0.04061375355955996,0.03163043926565768,0.03357904865937328,0.0,0.07450406464738016,0.03772012433078725,0.07475503245113764,0.04052725289295952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029696749959636764,0.0395431254576005,0.027350023937141008,0.0,0.11477944415123205,0.035932910277048154,0.0,0.06982891813449167,0.0,0.07139857956185962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02521113362418493,0.028296149451416425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025793326653934863,0.03248605179494333,0.0,0.0,0.07034167651990768,0.0,0.0,0.07570190930205056,0.040113382487803086,0.0,0.0,0.11220418254920844,0.0,0.07914439130054783,0.0,0.0,0.1191726750664838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08429223444313155,0.06354589159816923,0.10617168884212068,0.2366958635374736,0.0,0.0,0.05929528369244332,0.06774023796319308,0.0,0.0,0.03819049290698896,0.030776437069274427,0.0,0.07446392335488776,0.0,0.03152375422871771,0.028642297963323463,0.0,0.0,0.07900186811711203,0.03965567842132597,0.0594240700274881,0.031105123351143207,0.0,0.0,0.0425909297917528,0.0,0.0,0.1051960784267147,0.0,0.08392079822307558,0.05980808826330052,0.06503778163436877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09886964134353103,0.2622347317169589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035266077511788466,0.07110212074566327,0.0,0.025259815672047325,0.08093691408485347,0.03634396936321725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08195230641596657,0.03069809783123255,0.0,0.029531670754950886,0.029843681110752345,0.0,0.0,0.03448949358625915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07172876320785597,0.0,0.05417150105320432,0.03778357751805838,0.03791516788398662,0.13214715159996407,0.0,0.04520825981480542,0.0

alcoholism,DaveHNZ,2019/04/19,"When we stop I knew for a long time what happened if I didn’t drink in the evening… I wouldn’t sleep. But what I didn’t realise was that this only showed me one of several changes that had occurred in my brain and body as they adapted to a daily assault of alcohol.

Alcohol in the brain changes how we feel and it acts as a sedative. Alcohol changes our mood in two ways; we get happy and we become more socially confident. The happiness is caused by an increase in dopamine, and the social confidence comes from an increase in serotonin. The slowing down in the brain comes from changes in two other chemicals; GABA and glutamate. When we drink we get happy, and if we drink enough we will become so socially confident that we will dance on tables to show everyone what great dancers we are. Unfortunately, just when the alcohol is making us feel great it is also slowing down mental function… and we stop being able to do complicated things quickly enough to complete them successfully, things like maintaining balance and speaking clearly.

Anyone who drinks enough will experience these effects. But when we drink heavily AND regularly then some changes start to occur in our brain and our body, and it is these changes that cause us so much trouble.

The simplest change happens in our stomach and intestine. Alcohol is broken down there by an enzyme, and when we drink often then our body produces more of this enzyme. This means that our bodies process away alcohol more quickly, and we have to drink more to get the same effect. We drink more, and we drink more quickly. But it is the changes in our brain that cause the real trouble. Our brain recognises that it is getting more dopamine and serotonin than it ordered and it regulates down the amount of these. This makes us less happy and less socially engaged when we are sober.  Our brain also reacts to the daily slowing caused by our drinking by increasing brain speed and by increasing our alertness level. This makes us feel restless and on-edge when we are sober. Drinking returns all of these things to their normal levels, so we now drink to escape feeling ill-at-ease and down. Drinking more causes these adaptations to become more pronounced until we feel miserable, lonely, anxious and jumpy with a racing mind when sober… alcohol returns these to normal levels, but we need to drink more to achieve this. Eventually though we end up depressed, isolated, and anxiety-ridden, consumed by thoughts about our problems and we can no longer drink enough to get happy… we pass out first.

These are the adaptations that occur when we drink heavily over an extended period, and these adaptations are present when we stop drinking. When we stop then the reason for these changes is no longer present. When we don’t dose ourselves daily with alcohol we suddenly feel these changes fully;

* our mind churns and churns,
* we are so restless we can’t sleep
* our heart is pounding ready to respond to some emergency and this makes us hot
* we feel miserable
* we feel alone

This is what happens when we stop drinking. But these changes are not permanent. Just as they built up slowly over time they reverse themselves out. The first of these to return to normal is sleep. Our “flight-or-fight” mechanism stands down from high-alert; our pulse slows, the overheating stops and we become able to sleep again. These happen somewhere between one and three weeks. Our minds slow down after that and our mind stops racing, and the last changes; lowered mood and sociability drift back upwards but much more slowly; this happens over months not days or weeks. These are the physiological changes that are caused by alcohol. These will correct themselves once we stop drinking, but the psychological damage we have done persists; we have to work at those to set them straight again.

If you have just stopped drinking then you should know that sleeplessness, a racing mind, restlessness, and overheating are perfectly normal and to be expected; they are your body reacting to the sudden lack of alcohol and they will right themselves in due course… keep going.",8.380653651067085,9.086733670781896,6.8846862538679945,75.89881424059719,61.40054869684498,9.963837049797428,36.70657479184611,9.763852164103024,3.594026547995023,3302,144,550,58,43,980,285,729,0.106,0.8320000000000001,0.062,-0.9864,2,3,30,0,1,0,77.0,61,3,8,10,34,24,1,5,30,0,44,51,20,17,4,158,76,75,0,13,16,0,9,1,0,7,11,1,0,0,52,79,30,10,15,23,0,11,9,12,0,7,7,10,78,10,82,60,29,111,0,5,0,0,79,34,0,7,63,404,130,4,0.05849055175818575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125430585842156,0.0,0.030289285897010514,0.0,0.04677487310896684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03303883740655294,0.0,0.020448976881195347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027476899384020155,0.02248781194787575,0.0,0.0,0.12919643809530088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16242454313081378,0.0,0.26117919899601105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18025772585898345,0.4021891132334912,0.05038443123228042,0.030663115344570863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018860783540706246,0.0,0.02518891326114016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029928070967222005,0.0,0.5729847313740343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025902633971107872,0.12087275095249005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02794511438123768,0.0,0.028607491538218267,0.0,0.0,0.11829832165351492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04975203344560058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639724796288848,0.0,0.016620764239735592,0.0,0.0,0.06448603980318685,0.0,0.0,0.12930750437937516,0.12452855994795847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03465579272723838,0.0,0.030899239643326918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025994544940595908,0.0,0.0,0.016072438793110936,0.02383880315643589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01428776455858039,0.0,0.0,0.025881148857835136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808579497033373,0.0,0.0,0.03185667897873992,0.0,0.0,0.029472359523829164,0.0,0.14764695873437098,0.0,0.023343300190485004,0.0,0.04299728555140802,0.02168500149880225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461664400600305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03114526434868255,0.03963471161872405,0.02224235014865312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02798377935551229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03328752655611356,0.0,0.030069014397526975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024975305807272717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03303883740655294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170655858703047,0.11924750325719966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020699956791830804,0.0,0.0,0.22005324136520896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058287785382521926,0.0,0.02873333506483278,0.02321748231898395,0.03410631109875545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057136770058170215,0.0,0.17589233003352414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023213538737281325,0.046917592524722204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021290909149534264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,throwwayaway444,2019/04/19,"The love of my life just left for rehab. Feeling pretty broken, but hopeful. I would love to read some of your advice/stories of positivity on this journey. My boyfriend has been in active alcohol addiction for over 10 years now. He has refused help for those past 10 years. Last month he finally admitted he wanted help. We spent the past month trying to find a place that accepted his insurance. He finally left for rehab for 10 days. 

I am so proud of him, but can’t help but feel so broken at the same time. I miss him dearly, but I’m so relieved he is saving his own life. 

I keep hearing from friend/coworkers that it is a lost cause, and it breaks my heart. I don’t want to write him off. I would love to hear any advice/successes that you may have had. I’m trying to stay positive and give him a chance to do good.

alcoholism,little-black-book,2019/04/19,"3 months sober...now I feel like drinking. So I’ve been almost 3 month sober, which is the longest I’ve gone without drinking. It hasn’t been that long in the grand scheme of life, but it feels like it’s been waaaayyyyyyyyy longer!

I’m going out with a friend for dinner and then out. My friend doesn’t care if I don’t drink. Being around alcohol and out doesn’t trigger me. It’s just my own personal urges that make me want to drink. 

We’re going to a seafood restaurant and something about scallops and vodka bring back memories. I romanticize drinking a lot sometimes in this reminiscent way. Little things like warm weather and a patio trigger me because I used to love drinking outside. Even though I can become a mess when I drink and the energies outweigh the positives.

I rarely drink, but when I do, I can go overboard! I’ve ruined relationships and put myself is horrible situations because of it. I know this, but justify it away.😓

I am stressing over this! I feel like I just need to tell my friend I’m not drinking tonight to hold me accountable in a way, but ahhh...I don’t wanna give in. 3 months isn’t a long time and I wanna make it to one year etc 😩 This all sucks. 

Will urges ever go away? I’m thinking of trying weed for when I feel like being under the influence. Because that’s what I want...my life is very content and orderly right now lol",2.4502912895927587,4.6526160257352975,3.4569117647058825,88.91139140271495,78.08088235294117,6.2434389140271485,25.16742081447964,7.321109707123232,1.16869128959276,1077,40,217,14,26,345,142,272,0.067,0.725,0.208,0.9904,0,0,12,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,0,13,17,1,1,12,1,19,14,0,6,2,44,43,20,0,5,9,0,5,5,3,1,3,0,1,1,17,14,11,1,6,10,1,7,8,4,0,1,4,5,24,13,27,36,4,38,0,1,0,1,8,13,1,3,20,131,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08530736580769745,0.07993200477816251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07106010527470646,0.0,0.0,0.14999417473111545,0.06137957466539716,0.0,0.14597954202029292,0.0881591152237798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08138568367234057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7037724093549382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902463702552174,0.052722866801413686,0.07220519673943453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16144524606381255,0.22810455354293416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18501500868469886,0.0,0.0,0.07657426220236223,0.18146281941764134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04386907268894906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11276382065922474,0.1949893821501477,0.08000441766651703,0.0,0.14128310147984946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06786333989614694,0.07204409567066834,0.0,0.10656601215355764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.191143785838266,0.0,0.0,0.059188335961725826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0540906724669752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969906286561445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08024496608212506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08570088755025951,0.0,0.06816908871089307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08972529523955641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0614522607721781,0.07894777889636229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09143789274845077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06976951922916615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053031385523556976,0.051147867641663486,0.07842647782210645,0.0,0.04654589947433891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05419512015842768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06894213359155113,0.0,0.065862994496823,0.09416429033803722,0.12672083326520714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07694729429809194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051403909818080094

They want to stop and have been sober for a day, but I worry a lot. I work late nights and they are alone for a while at home. I worry temptation might take over while I’m gone. We no longer have alcohol in the house unless they have hidden something. I told them they always have my family to talk to or can even call me at work. What else can I do?

alcoholism,sowhoaskedyou,2019/04/20,"I’m so confused I guess. I’m sorry if this is long. So I’ve rejoined this group.  I initially couldn’t handle the messages. 

So I’m as some that post here are, drunk. But not falling down, messed up drunk... just I’m going to check all of my social media drunk. Ya feel me? 

I’m an alcoholic. I admit that. I’ve been to AA (and all m not up for it) but I know better and I lie to my AA friends on social media. I know that. It isn’t a question. My kids hate it. I know that too. But here is the thing... my hard drinking husband , can’t admit my alcoholism. He can’t see it. He thinks I should just control it like he does. And I try but can t make him understand. 

Cut to today. I told my kids (yesterday)... who don’t mind drinking but want to micromanage mine that I wanted a few drinks while we spent several hours in the Texas heat. My husband didn’t mind. 

My husband completely through me under the bus. For full disclosure... he doesn’t give two shits if I’m a drunk, just handle my shit and if I can be his drinking BFF then life is good. 



But... no argument... I wasn’t aggressive... my daughter lost her shit over the fact that I drank more than she expected. My husband and I were talking. We were hanging out. Next thing I know... I have an impromptu intervention after hours working in our yard. And my husband was conducting it. I have a felony DWI. I’m incredibly and honestly so sorry. I understand the ramifications of this and please do not beat me up for it. I also understand legal ramifications. 

So my son told me how I felt. My daughter, who I  fought with prior to this incident, gave her two cents...  but it didn’t stop there.   He attacked me. (Remember , we were good...)I should have known better blah blah blah.   Right or wrong, I am a victim of his ex wife attacking me, because we are together. And I was previously diagnosed with PTSD.  But he basically just said he was leaving me. 

I guess the kicker is this... I’m a black out drinker. And as a black out drinker, I’m mean as fuck. Like hate. But I’m blacked out so I don’t remember. But he, as a heavy drinker, does remember.  But I am held accountable no matter what. And I still accept that. And I have not blacked out in a good bit. 

But my hubs, is all on board with me sober. Ok. I can accept. I asked for this one day, (which he is fine with because he wants a drinking buddy and we worked out doors all day! ) . I don’t want to ruin Easter. I told my kids as much.   

But I have. And he loves me “but he is leaving me” and this is a narc game he is playing.  Which is rare for him but it’s still a narc game. Because you  “(I)” caused this (not I want you to drink but control it) thing. And we fought about the reasons I drink including some of his abuse while I black out... but I am wrong no matter what. He isn’t normally that way... maybe because we are always so YES together. He doesn’t see how his drinking is an issue for me.  

And on top of that... my severely narcissistic  ex husband wants to play games.

During this... my husband got more beer and is playing his music so loud on the porch.  And I’m not invited and I have to beg him to put together Easter baskets with my already pissed off daughter/.


We do not have shares biological kids.

alcoholism,GrumpyStumpySteve,2019/04/20,venting I acknowledged I had a problem with substance abuse and I stopped drinking and my GPA rose and i did super well and then i started drinking socially againa nd then i started drinking on my own again and then i started drinking during exams to cope with stress but now exams are done and im blackout drunk again for no reason other than that i want to be somewhere else but here mentally. im so fucking sad and i can't talk to anyone because i talked about how i was getting over a problem everyone saw and tried to help me with and i kept saying how better off i was now that i was sober but now i can't talk to my closest friends because i maintained sobriety for months and i benefited so much and was so happy. but I've voluntarily put myself back in this place but i don't understand why I've done it but i can't stop myself from wanting to not feel it. im drinking as i type this post and i'm already drunk i don't know why i'm doing this. it feels like the world i've built for myself is collapsing in front of me and i'm disapointing people i care about. they've already dealt with this once and it's come back and i can't imagine how much respect the people i love will have lost for me if i tell them i have a problem and i need help. i need help so bad.,1.2237777777777763,3.2790206370370387,2.9944444444444436,91.405,81.51851851851852,5.481481481481482,24.074074074074076,6.605766666666668,0.6988518518518516,1012,38,218,10,27,336,134,270,0.14300000000000002,0.6809999999999999,0.17600000000000002,0.9127,0,0,5,0,1,0,7.0,0,0,1,3,18,18,1,1,5,0,21,9,0,4,0,49,43,34,0,8,8,0,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,11,21,7,3,7,7,0,3,8,8,1,0,11,4,38,10,25,30,3,28,0,2,1,2,12,8,1,1,17,147,49,4,0.0,0.1127624344122696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2100478042617164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665459896025301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14636171860931904,0.0794640647293141,0.1160310888889036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08417128564228007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970334887249832,0.0,0.0,0.08198165258810572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947865764609461,0.0,0.4661582361546993,0.0,0.0,0.07950341357493439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094026081888999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09624294321041099,0.06799039961818228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07352911449568504,0.08798433830375699,0.04972307903849621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131162433773656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19137395972219254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3084040240402137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05230366052187256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04649589254673312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10389072232464397,0.0,0.08589581889003949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959102913475502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07596482801020946,0.0,0.13992372008949908,0.14113663413617106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013543342318223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13195960000609305,0.0,0.09943375799874306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09114780282708723,0.0,0.0,0.2731982584043923,0.0,0.09567344845212396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09785195274469843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07568404197761966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701516068486817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2020882194906379,0.0,0.0,0.15913494566358574,0.1090184088243816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22948527084863996,0.083183915794414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06461506918113068,0.0,0.0,0.09907668535315914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11226900349695383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08557043319947392,0.0,0.17175460040915888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Ungracefulbrat1,2019/04/20,"Can an alcoholic ever drink? My partner is a recovering alcoholic. She is about 5 months in, has 'relapsed' once which was a week of drinking. And has gotten drunk one other time after saying she would only have one. I'm wondering would it be a huge problem to have a couple drinks at home a couple times a year? I have always been able to convince her to not drink, and she doesnt want to drink, but when she asks if we could ever have quiet drinks alone again I dont know what to say? The worried girlfriend in me always says no, but would that ever be possible, what happens physically if an alcoholic drinks once?",5.05035123966942,5.859603818181821,5.717014462809918,81.0137035123967,68.66942148760329,8.36404958677686,27.521694214876035,8.472884824447931,1.86786694214876,486,15,93,7,8,158,80,121,0.116,0.857,0.027000000000000003,-0.8615,0,1,10,0,0,0,12.0,1,0,0,0,6,2,0,0,9,0,19,11,0,0,3,19,26,7,0,8,5,0,0,0,2,3,3,4,1,1,6,3,11,0,2,8,0,0,4,1,0,2,3,4,10,1,11,17,0,15,0,0,0,0,12,4,0,3,11,70,16,0,0.0978875251152726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3138359845526834,0.0,0.1013819546864625,0.0,0.0,0.16290052500409774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09151162213820388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07815522362413306,0.2166213693791304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11472345040685356,0.6712475591006164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26563461190001875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865616151809194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09818916895156753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053796423823413375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07813288864554642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20849403908909425,0.13266224073434107,0.07444787383098207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11035347669655518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09366514153628568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23353226666770605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11415800617068005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05773659849131125,0.0,0.07851946816297779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061548453852536,0.0,0.09940953332810216,0.0,0.20860946793476845,0.0,0.0,0.06303635680565839
alcoholism,gabeclark,2019/04/20,I use alcohol to mask my loneliness M(21) In fact it doesn’t work whatsoever. I’m severely depressed and each time I drink i want to drink more and more. One drink and I jump off a cliff to a binge. The only time I get any attention is when the bartender talks to me. I hate it and I hate myself for it. This shit is ruining my life. I started smoking again because why not. We all know the sunken cost fallacy and I am a living breathing representation of it. Drinking just makes me more depressed and makes me long for affection even more. It’s ruining my life. But my self loathing makes me want to screw myself up even more. I’m thinking about going to an AA meeting for the first time this week.,1.381994680851065,3.819064234042554,2.8270168439716343,90.49031250000004,83.9645390070922,6.3618794326241135,23.706117021276608,7.6454224807358475,1.212279787234043,551,21,116,10,16,179,84,141,0.217,0.742,0.04,-0.9788,0,0,5,0,0,0,14.0,1,0,0,2,6,8,4,0,8,0,4,10,2,5,2,23,19,8,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,7,8,5,0,3,4,1,2,2,8,1,2,0,0,20,0,14,19,7,14,0,4,0,1,4,3,2,0,9,75,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537241848015877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978180219383144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08768522265461001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24778314864179346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5636446455296737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19001359713110966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223525938840436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07515191485857495,0.0,0.0817491658623504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28402992775245656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07905222923319698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20320081673870688,0.0,0.0,0.1270158087104398,0.12729633247724856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2880485147576244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974715893713033,0.1093989148299022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500593888880092,0.16250139645146006,0.1476525450226773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018126589554334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1156153766661804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09216864432642886,0.0,0.0,0.25162764263565274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242339765681414,0.0,0.0,0.16968439515839154,0.0,0.11538200042559245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297957342557606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471925588502294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,cchdddy,2019/04/20,78 days sober I’m 29 years old recovering from liver disease . I’ve lost a great deal of muscle mass and am recovering from high levels of bilirubin (jaundice). Tonight I played a gig with my band for the first time in a long time as main support for a popular international act. I’m tired and my gear felt 100 times heavier than ever . Sometimes everything feels pointless without alcohol. Tonight reminded me there’s plenty more out there that I love doing . Not every day is awesome but it is getting better .

alcoholism,Cmonpow,2019/04/20,"My recovering alcoholic roommate just drank. (Need Advise) My two roommates and I are recovering alcoholics.  Tonight one of my roommates (will call M). went out tonight downtown with a friend who drinks.  M didn't have to but told me tonight he fucked up and drank two whiskey sours.  I didn't know how to respond but told him I wasn't happy.  I also told him that he would have to tell our 3rd roommate about this.  We can't kick him out due to the lease and I still want to give him a chance but there are red flags.  He has put no effort towards his recovery and  to be honest I think things will get worse if he continues.

  
Has anyone dealt with the situation and if not I would still like to hear your opinion.

addiction,Lillie1990,2019/01/01,"Quitting coke and need advice So I’m 20. I’ve been thinking for a while about quitting coke but have been getting sucked into the whole “oh it’s just one line” thing and then buying a whole sack and the cycle continues. I don’t know what to do. Coke is all around me. Most people I interact with daily are heavy users, I seriously can’t escape it. All of my roommates use heavily and regularly, most of my coworkers use it, and so do most of my friends. Another issue is the alcoholic culture around me. I’ll drink and then buy coke, or drink and do some if offered because I’m drunk and don’t care. And the thing is drinking is so heavy in my social circle too, and where there’s alcohol there’s coke. I don’t know, I’m just afraid if I drink I’ll do coke, but also don’t want to stop drinking altogether. I would just like to hear from people who have been through this and what helped you.

addiction,wizardslashmagi,2019/01/01,"I’ve had enough I’ve struggled on and off with addiction for about 4 years now. This year I had been doing better with the exception of heavy marijuana use, but no dissociative or stimulants. But, I got into benzos recently and they had basically cured my social anxiety. I was feeling better than ever. 


Then, last night happened. I felt like a piece of shit for spending New Years alone so I downed 3-4 etilozam, about 7-8 beers, some ciroc, and a Lunesta. Idek if that’s lethal or not but I couldn’t stop puking and I couldn’t stand up. I just laid beside the toilet puking and crying. My stomach is still severely aching but I think I’m finally feeling a little better 


Woke up this morning, dumped everything. I’ve said this many times admittedly, but I don’t want to do it anymore. I have always struggled with socializing, and as I’ve gotten older it’s caused me to grow bitter, especially seeing large groups of people hanging together having fun. I don’t hate them but I do envy them. I’ve always wanted that but I’m very bad about burning bridges due to my impulsiveness and mood shifts  , which is also one of the reasons I ended up turning to drugs. It numbed the loneliness, trauma, and helped me forget the horrible shit I had done to people back in high school 

I want what other people have. I’m sick of random hookups every few months, I want to find a real relationship, and I want to treat her right and be the person I’m supposed to be. I want to be responsible and I want to make money and keep the money for more than a few hours after splurging on some stupid shit that just ends up  hurting me.  I want to change. I’ve definitely reaped what I’ve seen and am still facing the consequences. 


The scariest part about quitting to me though is the fear of knowing that even without drugs, I may not get any of the Things I want in life that would be good for me.

addiction,Girl-Here,2019/01/01,"7 years in rehab. 1 major bender. 32 days in the SICU. My brother has struggled with drugs and alcohol since puberty, basically. He is turning 24 in a few days. 

He has been in and out of rehabs from super expensive (Hazelden) to work-your-way-through faith based programs. I have been listening to Dr Drew for years and was really nervous that my brother was in a faith based rehab for 5 years as Dr Drew says they’re “white knuckling” it instead of treating the addiction with therapy and equipping the person with tools for surging in the real world. While I consider myself a person of faith, I had considerable doubts about the faith based rehab. It seemed cult-like, and I was never convinced of my brother’s sobriety. For example, the rehab would set the addicts in front of a Walmart and get them to ask for money (!?!?!?!?). My brother boasted of getting tattoos as an exchange (for what? Bc they they feel bad for you? Utter bullshit). 

The day my brother left the 5 years of faith based rehab he got into a DUI. Luckily he came away physically unscathed.

Fast forward a year and a half and he has a solid career at a bank with benefits and salary. (We confirmed this with pay stubs and such.) At Thanksgiving, he seemed happier and healthier than I had ever seen him (as his younger sibling) since childhood. 

Apparently he had use-it-or-lose-it vacation days at the beginning of December. He used them, and went on a bender. He suffered a seizure from alcohol withdrawal. My parents went to clean up his apt, and he had clearly been doing lots of weed too. The doctors said they suspected addiction because of how he was absorbing medication.

When he had the seizure in a gas station, there was an elderly lady who had been sober for decades who scooped him up and asked him his name, if he had diabetes (no), and if he was an addiction. He answered her truthfully then lied when he spoke with first responders. I am so thankful she was there because he now tells us she was the last person he remembers and he thought he was dying. 

He was sent to the hospital, had a major brain bleed, was in a medical coma for weeks, had his entire skull removed, and is now kind of coming out of it. 

The doctors are telling my parents they should have an intervention. No shit. They have tried so
Many times. I wish there was better education among doctors. They should know that if they see a patient at this condition in his thirties this probs isn’t a first timer. I know the doc meant well but are there resources for parent of addicts in this situation who have tried and tried before?

My brother is now awake but extremely violent and confused. The doctors are super happy with his progress, as are we considering. 

Sorry, I needed to vent.  I don’t know how to handle this once he is more functional (hopefully). 

My key issues are available rehab options and medical professionals’ knowledge of addiction. (Groundbreaking, I know.) I’m sure everyone in this sub has the same issues. I’m hoping that identifying these issues and repeating them will help us and others understand and advocate for our loved ones.

addiction,deebeezkneez,2019/01/02,"Recovering parents: Should I adopt the grandchildren I'm raising? I've had them 2 years, with minimal contact from mom (my daughter), who got worse instead of better. I just retained a lawyer for adoption when my daughter called to say she's been sober 1-1/2 months and is ""considering"" going to some sort of rehab only for me so she can see her kids again. She still does not believe in rehab.

She's living with her latest fentanyl dealer (5 month relationship maybe?); they are ""very much in love""; he is getting sober as well and ""very supportive.

I'm thinking I should just continue forward with the adoption, because I'm the only family left who truly loves her. The adoption would give the kids 1/2 of my social security until they are 18, and due to her arrested development, even if she continues sobriety, ""adulting"" enough to support children will be a long, hard road. 

The children want me to adopt them, because they know I would let their mom return if she were well and truly sober, but I would NOT let the transient men who beat them enter their lives.

Let me end this by saying I don't believe anything my daughter is saying, but want to run through all scenarios just in case it is.",8.642072727272726,7.526478968888894,8.120606060606061,73.27363636363638,61.53333333333333,10.67070707070707,37.78787878787878,9.573946990214177,3.5410000000000004,948,39,169,14,11,300,137,225,0.024,0.87,0.106,0.8752,1,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,8,2,11,8,0,0,9,0,21,4,0,0,1,29,37,12,0,9,9,6,1,0,0,6,2,3,0,6,5,7,0,2,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,4,5,31,8,22,23,4,23,0,0,1,2,44,6,0,4,15,113,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09488714325299738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14057912727914235,0.0,0.0,0.2598211088508655,0.0,0.10197892643138626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11774047924534785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10090519583688692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10212703124292698,0.1191420844180611,0.0,0.07615862983287291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087003837088372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06024270843098235,0.1106121734950628,0.06553114678167997,0.0,0.09222086791265216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329166906553157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633692488804399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12528047796954994,0.3537250761364077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2036348999135416,0.10204232129269912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20813661876517656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11584053383922785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27009035713983265,0.1840725503457146,0.0,0.08476329337332418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1753910579967527,0.0,0.0,0.12803384281474856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12379566148921688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750882545028649,0.0,0.0,0.09188407912966623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11754010716026987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208364666797923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616961231527881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07388353014138033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19027931225597128,0.1360211188504161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20734816737948591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175068258088387,0.2457305588893273,0.0,0.0,0.07425338524445664

Any positivity/advice would be appreciated.",1.789733009708737,2.851691893203885,4.668143203883496,84.52609830097089,76.66990291262134,8.256796116504855,21.612864077669908,8.841846274778883,1.215369902912622,367,9,85,8,8,133,64,103,0.0,0.8540000000000001,0.146,0.9294,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,4,0,12,6,0,0,0,12,19,9,0,5,3,2,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,2,0,11,2,20,15,2,22,1,0,0,0,5,7,0,2,13,56,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34412868171911176,0.0,0.154235336238008,0.0,0.16867849026705184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10733376978229267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342550675630907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16492540266691355,0.0,0.08970173363449613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15676658241631075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13937192043645402,0.419039200757691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3697108087260928,0.0,0.0,0.116027488264286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16562214187909444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3013442987007178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3575944308165476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203533571945098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18619131162827746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121220377478502,0.0,0.0,0.30492327901027705
addiction,GottaNaruto,2019/01/02,"My New Years Resolution: Stay Clean [long post] I've been using heroin off and on since July 4, 2018. When I first used, I only used on the weekends and I would end up going through withdrawals throughout the week, I refused to use during my work week. At one point it got ""so"" bad that I was using at work, I work in the medical industry handling patient records and such, I interact with them on a daily basis. My colleagues had/have no idea of my addiction. I would start my day with a bump to coast me through, then around lunch time my friend who I used with would stop by and bring me lunch, we would do a couple of lines together, I would go back to work, and around 3pm I would go to the bathroom to do another bump. I would be coasting all day, it didn't matter how many patients complained or yelled at me, I would just have a goofy smile on and talk them down but I could tell that my work ethic was suffering in other ways. 

The last quarter of the year has always been extremely difficult, especially after my mother passed away three years ago (before my 21st birthday). I don't have any family in the area and in October of 2017 I left an extremely abusive relationship only to have to move three times in the last year, I do think I've been traumatized by that. I didn't have the support that I needed to get clean.

I opened up to one of the doctor's at my job, but he seemed to want to take advantage of my habit to try to sleep with me, this only served to deepen my trust issues. Here is this man, supposedly a doctor who had taken the oath to serve and help others, and his primary goal was to sleep with me. I opened up with my roommate, who I was extremely close to at the time; she only ended up judging me and going off the handle. I felt extremely alone, that only served to push me closer to my drug friend and, in turn, make me use more. He was the only one who understood what I was going through. My boyfriend at the time judged me and my only friend judged me.

I broke up with my boyfriend in September of 2018 after realizing that he was part of the reason I was using, he didn't care, he didn't even put in the effort to try to show that he cared; he definitely didn't want to have anything to do with me after I told him that I started using. It felt good, I felt good.

I ended up moving on extremely quickly, many will say *too* quickly, to my current boyfriend. I was completely upfront about my drug use I wanted to let him know what he was getting into before starting a relationship with me. He told me, ""Obviously I don't want you using, but I would rather have you be upfront and honest with me about it than lie and do it behind my back."" This acceptance is what I needed in order to finally say, ""Okay. I'll try to get clean."" It hasn't been an easy road, far from it.

Since we've been together I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, been put on meds that didn't work, relapsed *multiple* times, but he has stuck through it with me. He has been nothing but supportive when I've needed him the most. We haven't had a perfect relationship, but he was there when I relapsed. So was my drug friend, who wants to get clean and wants me to get clean, but I ended up just having to cut him out entirely. He has done a lot for me but the only thing I ever do when he's around is heroin. It wasn't a difficult choice.

I've been clean since a couple of days before Christmas Eve, and I know that doesn't sound like a long time, it's a good start. You have to start from somewhere, right? I was 2019 to be nothing but more improvement on myself, my relationships, and my work ethic.",4.468922817915299,4.898975136425649,5.302708774781575,84.82250878058692,69.80491132332878,8.475678499898407,26.782647818640967,8.464757390353514,1.6025948680734956,2817,82,597,41,47,920,280,733,0.099,0.8029999999999999,0.099,0.4456,2,1,3,0,0,0,91.0,2,3,2,12,26,25,1,0,33,1,73,13,2,14,4,105,129,35,0,20,13,1,3,1,4,10,9,4,6,1,34,39,2,2,12,2,0,12,13,7,0,7,41,7,94,18,107,73,6,113,0,2,0,0,52,48,0,4,50,403,128,11,0.0,0.05552380424365287,0.0,0.05108649449139395,0.0,0.0,0.04154033339488383,0.0,0.0,0.04853489669049838,0.0,0.0,0.03899293605234447,0.0,0.0,0.0318677653448211,0.04913889047255563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03856343113647808,0.12515133959437102,0.0,0.0,0.04402838936226817,0.07206796709546909,0.03912781058188395,0.0,0.0,0.11962832526438975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555785951457677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04913391291289795,0.0,0.0,0.037415491900420116,0.10370381806392884,0.0,0.09066633499673016,0.0,0.0,0.04756394114229786,0.0,0.0,0.05370790920028594,0.09593048054438172,0.0,0.04795609369857703,0.0,0.0,0.16303511860274725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.166023282037639,0.0,0.0,0.030951907458924836,0.042389359743095635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044177320740785085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349845999599923,0.051335027791288165,0.0,0.03986079123216918,0.0,0.0,0.14482185244568752,0.0,0.1224172979820282,0.0,0.13316376589986148,0.11791686074205852,0.03747982041796228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03141060919306635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052901491245795886,0.0,0.04891175038123418,0.04650330170839824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051508256684584926,0.07639756528805702,0.0,0.0,0.05091569752545147,0.047919567559190634,0.0,0.022894404943937817,0.0,0.0,0.08294278645706972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03984039457169238,0.0,0.0,0.03128074729763305,0.09502142060122992,0.0,0.0,0.052053115069533584,0.04720853246528894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09961377441502822,0.0,0.10424273233673832,0.0,0.04525960931251242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899307011740203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526470714661167,0.2851252869517978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050746976749112785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04429973488275553,0.0,0.04488083986292152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421850194807313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04818193840327941,0.0,0.20124899130350246,0.0,0.04001988991391918,0.0,0.07453308281319823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04266140261548835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11629418605786075,0.0,0.09379168157920628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658458155476764,0.04994865427079688,0.0,0.03917872834779744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10635687910824566,0.0,0.0,0.035234390159194995,0.03766589858231223,0.04095945144198654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031133028925120775,0.03002727586739755,0.0,0.0,0.16395364598233794,0.0,0.0,0.08955729389654554,0.0,0.09544866083556676,0.05097239664415205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4452109180030851,0.0,0.0,0.1658425220762147,0.03719687246063569,0.07517973562985321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23881264671379895,0.0,0.0,0.2996047671260512,0.0,0.0,0.12071036013341152
addiction,FuckBrendan,2019/01/02,"Junkie mom with the absolute worst possible job and I’m not sure how to deal with it anymore. My mom who is an alcoholic/opioid addict with a love for adderall as well. She’s a fucking hospice nurse who gives percs and diladed to dying patients who may or not be responsive. Idk what kind of scheme she’s playing but she has most definitely been high to the point of nodding off for basically every moment I’ve seen her since her last patient died over 2 weeks ago and I see her a lot because we live together. She came in one day throwing up nonstop while telling my family she must be sick and that she hit the curbs 5 times on the way home from work. 

Anyways today my dad and I picked her up from the hospital because she ‘fell asleep at a table’ at a patients house while all the family was there- but of corse that’s not what really happened according to her. We get to the hospital and she’s fucked. Slurring her words, needs help getting in the car, drops her keys multiple times... and then when we get to the house she won’t give me her keys because it’s a hippa violation for me to pull her car from a patients house!!? I called her out on it- told her she was fucked up, yelled at her to give me her keys so she starts crying, denying it, and ran away to her car. My dads a soft moron and he let her drive her car down the street- and also clean up the mess of needles or whatever rigs she was using in her car. We get home and she’s mad at me for not believing that she isn’t fucked up lmao. I’m losing my mind. If her work doesn’t fire her IMMEDIATELY I’m going to call them myself, and potentially the police, to stop this. She’s going to hurt someone acting like this it’s terrifying.

addiction,SweatyYear,2019/01/02,"cant stop smoking cigarettes id like to start this off with an apology, i don't usually like asking strangers for help and reading some of the posts makes me seem as it isn't as important. 

about 2 years ago i decided i would become cleaner, i had a few bad addictions and when the wife showed me her pregnancy test it made me want  to change. with a lot of sleepless nights, pain and tears I've finally managed to kick the worst of it. along with my cleanse of drugs i vowed to myself i would cut alcohol tobacco sugar and caffeine.

it absolutely blows my mind that with the help of my loved ones i have managed to kick everything else to the point where i don't crave or want anything except cigarettes and caffeine. I'm trying to focus on just the cigarettes right now but for the life of me i cant seem to stop for more then a few  hours at a time. i cried tonight on the deck about it as i had one

my wife has been a huge help with everything else not batting an eyelash or losing her temper once when I'm up at 3 am making a ruckus building or cleaning something to help me keep distracted as she understood how important it was to us as a family, her current attitude is who gives a shit right now though, she doesn't care about a 10$ a day habit as long as the other stuff doesn't come back

i know deeply that my life would be better without it

the tl;dr is why do i still want a cigarette but not alcohol or other drugs?",5.320097706879363,5.056848786440682,5.977647058823532,83.1132901296112,67.91525423728814,9.924227318045864,30.91226321036889,9.627879704456738,2.5345134596211367,1132,40,243,22,17,370,162,295,0.118,0.769,0.113,-0.7615,3,0,10,0,0,0,14.0,1,0,0,2,13,13,3,1,23,0,21,11,1,4,0,44,40,23,0,6,11,2,0,2,0,3,8,0,1,0,14,12,3,3,5,2,0,1,10,8,0,2,6,1,30,5,43,30,6,34,0,1,0,1,17,11,1,8,23,163,44,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826831291113628,0.0,0.0,0.09616837477871328,0.231882101411878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08927666668035647,0.0,0.10142196062345242,0.0,0.0,0.08342084310318316,0.0905832391025672,0.0,0.11981685698034635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594912768277353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11061110125781104,0.0,0.11476628724869625,0.09345310567372077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119169356168,0.06996600950769602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2516240820511725,0.0,0.18125618783434536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19500466380727366,0.0,0.10227315937340288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884368247550672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407190906336554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908698115820646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068391695654167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642942853019257,0.0,0.0,0.0596223589006077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15325705728996852,0.10600385384751897,0.0,0.0,0.09600877413969744,0.0,0.12137071127970958,0.0,0.09223291397498044,0.09791496982858172,0.1026542981111846,0.14483362956578938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954230502986392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180896549004352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11553655005035025,0.14702902474679472,0.0,0.11543925137617313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255655548800116,0.0,0.10390184853096124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851770658821187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18529691301508103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19752743514654386,0.0,0.0,0.11136173030568162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08351963062888057,0.0,0.0,0.07678861117197783,0.0,0.08663893493314978,0.18140223359730784,0.0,0.0,0.1241932029651656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658925118328504,0.0,0.06326042821757043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07365646699802039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13049812494688692,0.0,0.1194845883142988,0.0,0.19196771563750528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789385987757926,0.0,0.0,0.1045788961531256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312010294234165,0.0,0.0,0.06986293924649321

addiction,dntrcyclthrwaway,2019/01/02,"Refusing Help I've been offered help in seeking professional help, however. I refuse it every time. I'm getting too old for this and i'm just a burden on my family. My addiction affects them also. They talk about a future and getting back on track hopefully, and deep down inside i'm screaming. I can't tell them I gave up on myself already and just want to end it.

Why do I refuse help? Is it a conscious decision? 

This has been my biggest downfall. I just don't want to be a burden on anyone anymore and either make something out of my life or fade away. I just can't take it anymore.

addiction,WithdrawalWednesday,2019/01/02,"25y girl new to Sweden and having a hard time. Anyone down to chat? Ngn I Sverige? As the title reads new to Sweden from Atl and in need of someone to talk to who understands addiction. 
Kind of surprised about how late Sweden is when it comes to meetings/addiction support. 
Feels like society here sees it more as a choice rather than the disease it actually is.

addiction,Kc_13,2019/01/02,"Dealing with meth addict boyfriend. My experience. 

I’d like to start by stating that I’m new on here.  And this is going to be a long post.

This would be an extremely long story regarding my experience having to deal with my now ex bf of 9 years. So long story short, he [m31]  did tell me me [f28] he had used meth on and off since he was in high school. He was never detailed about how much or how often and I feel completely ashamed I was totally oblivious to his use. We had a semi long distance relationship. We are about a 45 minute drive from each other and I would only stay at his place during my two days off work. He lives in the converted guest house at his parents place. So I wasnt really around him much often other than when I didn’t have to be at work. Throughout our whole relationship I was completely oblivious to his use until he told me back in 2017 that he had apparently relapsed and had started using again, to what I must believe he meant using more often than he ever did. I always thought he used before we got together not at all while we were together. I know that sounds stupid. So moving along, when he told me he had relapsed I told him if he didn’t quit I’d leave him. He said he was going to stop. I naively believed him. By that time (when he relapsed) it started showing in his appearance, he was always on the slimmer side but looked healthy with a full face, when he finally told me it finally dawned on me how much his appearance had changed, he had become thinner looking emanciated. At the same time he had a nasty falling out with one of his sisters and I thought that was what was gravely affecting him and his appearance because it caused a lot of tension at home and with his parents.  
What I’m trying to sum up is even though he apparently used for a long time he never demonstrated nasty behavior as he did the last 3 months of 2018. It started with him having  what I believe is the beginning stage of formication. Started on his feet, then his legs and then up his arms and chest area and then his face. He first began to say he probably picked up a virus from his work. He had started a job where he cleaned the outside of a property home ( cleaning the big glass windows, washing the tennis courts,etc..). He then said it was probably a staph infection. He would always refer to it as so. He became almost obsessed over cleaning himself to rid of whatever he thought it was digging into his skin. He even said he felt the oozing and burning sensations of where he felt the thing affecting another part of his arm or any other body part. He would shower on the daily and apply so many ointments to try and treat what he thought was staph. I tried and begged him to go get it checked but he always refused. Partly was because he has no health insurance what so ever. But also because he probably knew it was the meth use and he maybe wanted to make himself believe it wasn’t that, that was causing him that much damage.
I tried to help him as much as possible, buying him ointments to try and treat whatever it could be. I did know because I read up on it that it might be the whole formication thing but when I would try to tell him he was quick to shut it down. He kept denying it must be that because he claimed he’d be doing meth since he and never did it have this type of reaction.
It gets worse and this is the part where I need advice. One night it completely took a turn for the worst. He started accusing me of implanting all these sorts of parasites and amoebas on him. He said I would put our dogs hair in his open sores because he came up with this theory that dog hair stays alive if it comes in contact with an open wound. Saying that he was seeing all sorts of bugs and roaches in his place and that I was probably bringing them in with me and trying to infest his home. Of course that was stupid and it scared me. I would no way try to harm him let alone do any of the things he was accusing me of. I stayed at his place for days too so it’d be stupid to think I was trying to jeopardize his home while I was there too. I tried to calm him down but it wasn’t working. I Ended up leaving that night because I was extremely afraid. He continued to harass me through text sending me pictures of what he supposedly had collected that I had implanted on him, what he believed were the amoebas and parasites, which just looked like dried scabs with lint on them. 
He also started to accuse me of knowing his friends and he would say I talked and hung out with them. I’ve only met about 5 of his friends and the times I even did talk to them he was present. I never exchanged numbers with time or even add them on any social media. Nothing to do with them. But he was so adamant that I did, he would go through my phone and check everything. Accusing me of cheating on him with them even saying that I was probably cheating with someone at work. He had no evidence to prove I was doing so those were just his accusations. I was never unfaithful to him even in the slightest bit.
He also believes that if it wasn’t me who was trying to poison him that it must be his parents. He ended up calling an ambulance one morning because he said someone had sprayed raid inside his whole house, even on the pipe he had and he ingested it. He was super high where they had to knock him out. His mom had to go pick him up. They told her he was using meth and he had a skin infection. Any longer and he would have probably died as his heart was beating extremely fast. They gave him antibiotics. When he woke up he tried calling me and he seemed really apologetic and he realized what had messed him up. He said he was going to quit using. But it didn’t last long. His parents tried supervising him, having him stay in a room inside their house but he didn’t want to. He stayed sober 3 days before he moved back to the guesthouse and started using again. And again his harassment to me continued. He would text me accusing me of trying to harm him and being the culprit of his state of being. Calling me names and even threatening me that he was going to get even with me for all the distresss I had caused him. It baffles me that he still thinks I’m the one trying to harm him when he got a diagnosis from the hospital and he still denies it. They never said it was staph either, just summed it up that he is using meth and as a result from picking at his skin he ended up causing an infection.

I had to make the hard decision of leaving him. His accusations were completely outrageous and when I would try to defend myself, even being completely rational he would still not believe me. I became afraid of him. I stayed with him up until a week ago. I tied to rationalize with him and we’d have our good days but the bad days outweighed them. He became extremely paranoid. 
Out of most of the post I’ve encountered I have yet to see any similar story to my experience. 

I was unable to include a lot of information, also I’d like to point out he would mainly smoke it and he said as of recent he had started eating the meth. Never shot up if that even makes a difference.

addiction,EnterSandstorm,2019/01/03,"[Advice] Doctor SO being harassed by patient who wants Fentanyl Throwaway account for privacy. Any insight appreciated. My SO is a Doctor, and has a patient who is demanding oral Fentanyl for symptoms that are highly suspect. They have a history of harassing doctors at this hospital for pain meds. Patient is currently receiving painkillers via IV, but wants an oral prescription so they can leave the hospital. SO wants to get them proper help instead, but patient has threatened to assault any psych consult who enters their room. They are at an impass, and the harassment is becoming extreme.

addiction,keb1991,2019/01/03,"I want to go to long-term treatment, looking for suggestions? I'm finding it difficult to search on google due to large rehabs with ads and sites that don't fit what I'm searching, and do not do what they claim to.

A little background: I am in my late 20's, female, have been using heroin for the better part of 8 years. I have maintained sobriety for 2 years a few years back utilizing the 12-step program.

General Wants/Needs for a Rehab Program:
1. 6 months or longer, please
2. VERY inexpensive OR a work-to-stay program. I have Michigan Medicaid, so I don't think I can get an out-of-state program paid for by my insurance (?)
3. Preferably out-of-state (but if you know of a good program in Michigan I would still like to hear of it)
4. Ideally a program that after a couple of months allows patients to re-acclimate to outside world, allowing patients to get jobs, etc.

If you could provide names of centers, websites, or contact info on centers that you recommend; send me a direct message. Thank you so much.",4.613074691805654,5.824879375634524,5.351664249456128,81.7565609137056,69.96446700507614,8.065119651921682,32.853154459753455,8.418075326091056,2.619164176939812,795,37,149,12,14,258,125,197,0.043,0.848,0.11,0.882,1,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,4,1,2,4,6,0,0,11,0,12,2,0,3,0,24,25,10,0,7,7,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,7,3,0,0,5,0,2,2,3,1,0,0,2,2,15,5,26,21,4,22,0,0,1,0,11,10,0,5,11,88,22,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14270495360805516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641366270749316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1481761245963521,0.2053484945147228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20697857171472184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16962316318927753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19392310379680025,0.0,0.10547337354383833,0.1556615772581426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2091700461544933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18416646897025027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10199376611897816,0.0,0.20935022871074704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090668437784034,0.18600693754849604,0.0,0.1642386620646486,0.15584634550142706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962675584857637,0.0,0.13642780485065367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20097264442433507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20371880413482435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19781105747180114,0.14821002438196015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17086358263543258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11891666110011982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1602875880039138,0.0,0.15312871790647006,0.10946402575676834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13510955220988544,0.0,0.0,0.13183568578575972,0.0,0.0,0.35853584547550915
addiction,ChemicalFun0,2019/01/03,"Been using IV meth and heroin simultaneously for the last 3 weeks, in a bad way and can't stop for fear of facing comedown and withdrawls. Need advice! I have been using meth off and on for the past couple months, and heroin along side it for the past 3 weeks, which at first helped to ease my jitters, and has allowed me to sleep each night.  However, I haven't given myself more than 12 hours between dosing, and have also been dosing in the morning and mid day to have energy at work.  After 3 weeks of speed and h daily, i'm to the point where I can feel the impact of on my teeth, heart, and brain. Common sense tells me I need to stop before something serious happens like an abcess tooth,or heart attack or something, but I'm scared to face the comedown and  withdrawls when I stop.  I fear that taking any time off work for detox could compromise my, and I also fear that my withdrawl symptoms will cause issues at work,, and will arouse suspicion from my coworkers or roommates.  Moreover I have been continuing to use compulsively to avoid  dealing with everything I've neglected during my use, because its been piling up and I'm afraid to even look at the actual state of things, and feel the full weight of the pain and regret, and shame from foolish behavior.  I feel like a piece of garbage, and I feel shitty for being emotionally unavailable and absent from those around me and those who care about me.  I feel like I'm barely human at this point, my self worth is at 0, I feel self conscious,  guilty for continuing to use despite the negative impact its having, and I feel cowardly and ashamed for isolating from friends and family  and avoiding dealing with reality and the mess that's piled up.  I'm in denial of just how much of a wretch I'm turning into, and somehow still rationalizing my continued self destructive and hedonistic behavior.  I dont wanna white knuckle this, but I dont want to buy another supply of drugs.  Any recommendations for substitutes? Places that can help that are covered by insurance or free?  Otc stuff?  Other things?  I'm so embarrassed, I've been a total idiot, and I've lost control.  But I fear that admitting and reaching out to those around me could get me fired, evicted,  and outcasted.  I dont know who to turn to.  I fucking despise 12 step groups, and I feel more miserable than when I came by the end of each meeting.  Anyone who has dealt with anything like what I'm experiencing please share what worked for you.

addiction,crabdreams,2019/01/03,"Confused, ashamed afraid I didn’t get a response on r/heroin but maybe that’s because my posts conclusion was obvious. I’m guilty of making my sort of boyfriend but not really boyfriend relapse.
Most of our relationship problems came from him hiding his addiction with endless lies and the typical bullshit that comes from being an IV heroin addict. Anyway
We were out at a small sleazy get together and I was extremely drunk; I suggested we smoke some meth but we couldn’t find any. So I suggested we do some heroin knowing someone owed him money for it anyway. I only wanted to snort it but he pressured me to inject so we did.
I don’t know what came over me and I’m wracked with guilt, we banged up 3 times over a couple of days.
I don’t know who to blame, knowing somewhere inside this was a terrible thing to suggest and how could he resist, or that he promised he would never introduce me to a needle no matter what and he was sober in the situation 
Maybe we’re just terrible for each other and this was a climax to it.

addiction,__The_Senate__,2019/01/03,"Addicted To Brain Stimulation I can't focus or study, because I want constant stimulation. First thing I do when I wake up is coffee. It gives me the first dose then I would look at naked women and whack mine. Then I would usually eat something sometimes I'm not even hungry I just want to get the high of tasty food. 

After that I would be on social media doing stuff talking to people to get the high from that. 

If I'm not stimulating my mind I feel fatigue.

addiction,SayrahBelle,2019/01/03,"Opiates required for IOP admission? My husband and I are trying to help my brother-in-law begin rehab and feel like the story we’re getting is a bit sketchy. 

BIL claims that the clinic can’t see him until Wednesday and that he has to have opiates in his system when he gets there to qualify. Meaning he has to use some sort of something until then??? (Not sure if it matters if it’s subs or heroin but he’s trying to get us to pay for subs from a pain clinic...)

Is this a real thing?? It sends up all the red flags for me, but this clinic also feels like BIL’s last shot at surviving. His health has been falling rapidly. Any advice or experience here?",2.267727272727271,4.227049409090913,3.718181818181818,87.99727272727274,77.63636363636364,5.612121212121212,23.87878787878788,6.42735559955562,0.7188969696969698,510,17,101,4,12,168,93,132,0.075,0.826,0.099,0.3094,0,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,1,0,0,2,4,4,0,0,6,0,9,6,0,1,2,21,18,14,0,2,7,1,2,2,0,0,6,0,0,0,8,3,0,1,3,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,4,8,3,16,17,3,13,0,0,2,0,11,3,0,6,9,64,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2031710832804189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16626869240400258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138860011682328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22698815918463336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2033797162821713,0.0,0.0,0.21025505733704905,0.2970675021614137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32587933677456565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22100278203949175,0.0,0.0,0.13936032271387375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694776005084305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20315248530955424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2264792186946099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22123507748197635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366515672187897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1656804812111105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600622988556579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.195956415754316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13812877462506948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2823198173774553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25009485456379305,0.17957087749119152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,dantessah,2019/01/03,"Not sure if I'm addicted? I don't know what to do... Hi, I'm not sure if I'm just freaking out over nothing, but I just wanted to make sure it was nothing before I go and tell my mental health worker.
Since I was 17 (I'm a couple months off 21 now), I've been taking sleeping pills pretty much every night, rarely taking even a day or two off them.
I've tried quitting them, reducing them, but I can't sleep without them, at all. The longest I've gone without sleeping pills and hence not slept is three days, but most of my attempts to get off them lasted two days before I couldn't take it anymore and went back on them.
The sleeping pills that I take are anything I can get my hands on, really. Every time it stops working or I take too much, I switch brands. I've taken many different ones, Valium, restavit, phenergen, Ambien, temazepam, seroquill, polaramine, just to name some. It's gotten to the point where my psychiatrist told my G.P to stop prescribing sleeping pills for me.
If I can't get or find a pill to help me sleep, I have a panic attack and get very angry.
Each time I'm prescribed a sleeping pill, I always end up taking either the highest dose or often even more, and pretty much always more than I was prescribed, as it takes more and more to help me get to sleep.
I've overdosed accidentally 4 or more times, probably more, I've lost track. I often take a bit too much (but not overdosing) or occasionally even mix them together and end up almost killing myself. I like the feeling of being sleepy, I'm a chemical sort of way, it's hard to explain, and I can't sleep without it. I'm writing this at 4:30AM, and the drugs haven't kicked in yet. My sleeping schedule is screwed. Usually when I take the pills I sleep for 12-16 hours, 16 if I take too much. Yesterday I woke up at 6pm, the day before 5:30pm. I'm taking phenergen at the moment, I've been told it's not addictive, but I'm craving it.
I'm really, really itchy, all day long, and especially after I take it. I feel like bugs are almost constantly crawling under my skin. I think this might be because I'm trying to cut down, but I'm not sure.
I've lied to the pharmacy and doctors about how often I'm taking these things.
Some other weird things that are happening, include:

I'm seeing things, more than usual
I'm hearing things OUTSIDE of my head sometimes, rather than just inside my head like normal
Apparently sometimes I'm seeing people that don't exist, only I can see them
I'm feeling less and less sleepy, but exhausted when I wake up
I'm getting agitated and anxious way more easily
I recently went through a phase of complete emotional numbness, I couldn't feel anything at all for a few weeks

This is really starting to affect my life, I'm sleeping way too much. I've tried going to bed earlier, but I find if I do that I just lay awake for hours and can't sleep, even with the pills.
I recently switched from restavit to phenergen, as my dr won't give me the prescription ones, and before I switched I started having nose bleeds every day, for about five or so days.
It's the itchiness and constant over the top anxiety that's really getting to me. Oftentimes I feel so bad from the pills that I just want to die, or harm myself in some way (I've been a cutter for years, but I'm trying not to).
I've tried to stop, but I can't. I get really bad withdrawals if I do, and I just can't. The idea of stopping terrifies me, and even the mere suggestion almost gives me a panic attack.

Do I sound like I'm addicted? I mean, if it was anything other than sleeping pills I'm sure people would suggest rehab, but I'm not sure if sleeping pills counts as a real addiction, let alone a drug addiction. I feel like my psych knows something that I don't.
Sorry for the long post.
Thanks.",5.575363636363636,5.417667110526316,6.300047846889952,80.65897129186604,67.36842105263158,9.330143540669855,30.430622009569372,8.97023862654752,2.3177894736842104,2964,100,598,46,44,976,296,760,0.153,0.7809999999999999,0.066,-0.9969,2,1,3,0,0,3,106.0,0,0,8,6,31,27,5,2,31,0,39,50,22,3,9,119,119,53,2,15,47,0,9,5,0,3,27,2,1,0,30,21,0,4,14,0,0,5,24,15,0,6,17,15,73,12,70,94,27,76,0,1,3,1,22,24,1,28,47,357,103,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20503989578740936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11300369049221512,0.03895976914661434,0.0,0.0,0.062600557146975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028776829534060158,0.042496395676296594,0.03730586201785422,0.0,0.0,0.09286652349294107,0.0,0.0,0.08558932048921923,0.0,0.028925078163965105,0.06281708920505788,0.022930916276818203,0.0,0.12803686291720998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04106791781114082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0394406094353778,0.08130102179261726,0.0,0.0,0.041622390144946175,0.0,0.16981854330210278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03904040867868605,0.03930165960851606,0.0,0.03850249646111395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08724733496476028,0.0,0.0,0.04231395527953171,0.06663482547822065,0.0,0.0,0.12422805563354128,0.0,0.09508159516411713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141214252555494,0.053747049215912335,0.0,0.0,0.06876233977335339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15722624319060904,0.07217112636005114,0.04275710824099108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03326450505749624,0.0,0.03369735836716836,0.0,0.07721159447367608,0.039985011206900664,0.04239698610039976,0.0,0.0504276372821026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409014859344856,0.0,0.0,0.04246490725200889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04161753222173378,0.0,0.04134653468766613,0.030662798418697276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03846583421443945,0.026569932623484033,0.09188859894488466,0.0,0.0,0.06657955477583165,0.0,0.0,0.04106329568010124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02510957633681221,0.03813763768999635,0.0,0.040975837562152825,0.0,0.0,0.03790899287486118,0.03990559189200461,0.0,0.0,0.030025454863271468,0.0,0.16591652157562894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03530091731330831,0.03685658029391083,0.07218887019118557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050980377025347016,0.0286093515052204,0.0,0.08827066652978811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052157651343932535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035560134294594106,0.0,0.036026596931191146,0.07653983226789415,0.04055738614285077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040010209061691566,0.0,0.04281627353307716,0.14459011633289698,0.0,0.07428431154209893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899274095582265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031117092723338444,0.0,0.5646610755402095,0.0,0.0,0.028959331436841863,0.07440816225584178,0.04210904565643421,0.0532508782608319,0.0,0.0,0.1257976685617978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21272092797276074,0.0,0.3676820062049349,0.0,0.03287883319764349,0.034632592339289524,0.0,0.0,0.09996400136523023,0.024103393963225098,0.0,0.0,0.065804159829067,0.0,0.0,0.07188912995642516,0.0,0.12769704704159002,0.0,0.07349250090670519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08285941325492087,0.03103788637048682,0.044374850642579095,0.11943419377473426,0.03017401235363072,0.0,0.0,0.06974249601985615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10878406281948454,0.0,0.027385555017963057,0.0,0.0,0.026721970189111877,0.0,0.0,0.024224053645317958
addiction,throw_away_rec,2019/01/03,My marriage depends on spice My wife and I are in a government job where there is regular drug testing. Many people in the in our job use synthetic canabinoids to experience a marijuana like high because they are hard to test for and get out of your system quickly. Some of my friends got me into synthetic canabinoid vape juice and I used it occasionally with them for about a two years. It effects everyone differently but my favorite thing to do when high is watch porn and masturbate. Cumming feels good but it feels so much better when I am high. I met my current wife at work and asked her out on a date. I had recently gotten my own vape for synthetic canabinoid juice. On the first date we got high and fucked and it felt amazing. We got married about a month later after many more nights of high sex. I feel like I rushed into the marriage but my job is one of the few jobs that pay you better once you get married so I was also driven by the financial benefits. We have been married for over 2 months now and have had high sex almost every night. We have only had sex sober a few times and that was about a month ago. Lately I have started to worry that the synthetic canabinoid juice is fucking me up. Every time I have trouble remembering something or getting motivated I start to wonder if this sort of thing happened to me before I was a daily user. I have had to switch to a different brand of juice because the places where I used to buy synthetic canabinoids from have all been shut down and the new blend feels different and has wierd after-effects. I had a dream that I was visiting my family and I was a total wreck because the drugs had destroyed my brain. In the dream my father looked more disappointed in me than I have ever seen him before. I want to stop using and I don't have a physical dependence on the drug so it would be easy except I don't think I can get hard or ejaculate from sex without it anymore. I don't even know if I'll be able to enjoy sex with my wife without getting high and I don't think I'll be able to perform in bed. She has a very high sex drive and needs sex almost every day often twice a day. One of the reasons she left her ex boyfriend is his inability to satisfy her in bed. I love her and I don't want to let her go or make her sad. We have similar interests and goals and get along very well. I know she loves me very much.  I don't know who to talk to about this. My friends would probably say I'm paranoid about the synthetic canabinoids damaging my brain and I'll be fine but I feel the drugs changing me. My parents would just judge me for doing drugs in the first place. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading. Any advice or similar experiences welcome.,4.617722923653581,5.474136618613142,5.474537384099428,82.19253797593215,69.67518248175182,8.917025054251333,29.044387453146573,9.142720283898788,2.287535450779247,2169,78,437,41,37,710,246,548,0.08199999999999999,0.7709999999999999,0.14800000000000002,0.9903,9,0,6,0,0,0,31.0,6,3,2,10,22,24,3,0,29,0,50,20,3,10,3,85,97,35,0,9,15,6,8,2,2,3,5,1,2,0,16,31,0,1,16,3,2,5,8,7,1,6,21,13,74,17,67,68,10,70,0,3,3,12,41,35,2,14,31,298,90,12,0.11495442295681067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056166065840450516,0.05095007999911248,0.0,0.11511024945925323,0.0,0.0,0.0459645052533362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03908647478288059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05700194919913055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05373343387909207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051127238991399,0.0,0.0978177471429279,0.0,0.0,0.1016678454332048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12832715373003242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608032685378863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741360928650077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18015435778221514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3332765875400919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037963156100994905,0.05199142841467607,0.14528108892708122,0.05492193869940151,0.0,0.11244748367611328,0.05418439964101653,0.0,0.14531102560226558,0.041061731364662665,0.055187136649677136,0.0,0.0,0.09778017344256898,0.0,0.0,0.08881350201965653,0.10627351167267804,0.21020629499133456,0.0,0.032665623846036065,0.04820915800025833,0.13790932998742395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05082690828894792,0.0,0.10297658361953647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4858226371585906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2281490540523747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09476391680877698,0.0,0.0648367980787544,0.0,0.06244915844733845,0.0587743429368898,0.0,0.05616092448450942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0482663816362437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10375085483884418,0.0,0.03836648497969721,0.1165457420680751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13763328551243847,0.0,0.08450472769868493,0.04261862402013539,0.0,0.05551184900901858,0.0,0.10787693871879328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061211354371248,0.07789609203938458,0.0437140093516714,0.0,0.0,0.06382164137738389,0.0,0.0,0.03984746138327959,0.0,0.12010290518814346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061970155346038426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057492765628118336,0.0,0.0,0.05909614621585443,0.05675181223246619,0.0,0.06511047609228475,0.0,0.0,0.04570818553397342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044248765478562505,0.0,0.0,0.08136533223599847,0.0,0.0,0.048053522455109264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046198005388267335,0.0,0.052917294022413484,0.0,0.0,0.07637061066750843,0.07365815257456496,0.0,0.0,0.06703084846509767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05614688384892631,0.0,0.0,0.19856742535112087,0.0,0.14227415691068696,0.101704645539489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05167891585468737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11081196157221608,0.06233158403464097,0.041844094506563914,0.05837089826655999,0.0,0.12249048579749572,0.0,0.0,0.03701343972769163

addiction,C00kiemonstaar,2019/01/03,"Coming to grips that I have an addiction and a real problem Hello everyone! I read through a bunch of recent posts and a common trend I’m seeing is: how do I stop using?

In my experience, I could not stop my addiction until I admitted that I was powerless over it and my life was completely unmanageable. 

And when I say “admitted that I was powerless”, I don’t mean: “yeah I guess this is a problem, but I don’t wanna stop yet”, I mean: “This has ruined my life to the point where I don’t want to keep doing this to myself anymore and I NEED help.” 

Once I truly admit to myself that I have a problem and my life is unmanageable, I’m able to finally reach out for help and start putting my life back together. This process is always different for each individual, but my experience, strength, and hope have shown that it is possible. 

If you guys have any questions or thoughts, please don’t be afraid to let your voice be heard! We’re in this fight TOGETHER.

addiction,unknown0619,2019/01/03,"Addicted to cigarettes at 17 At the moment of me writing this post I am 17 (F), about two months ago I started getting into drugs due to curiosity and stress from a toxic relationship I just got out of at the time. My friends and I began with marijuana then later transitioned into opioids. Although we smoke weed more than anything else. One day we didn’t have weed on us, so we then decided to experiment with cigarettes. My friends and I were completely new to smoking cigarettes as we only shared one altogether. A slight suggestion from a friend, of smoking another cigarette did not seem bad so we smoked another one as a group. Instantly I was hooked on the feeling. Since my father is a casual smoker, I’m able to sneak around 3 cigarettes a week 4 at most. I was starting to get off my habit until recently I caved back in due to stress. 

My friends know about my smoking habit but do not comment on it, they continue to offer me weed and smoke on the regular with them. 

Any advice or any beneficial words from people who will help me understand how to lower this habit and stop it all together would be a necessity to me.

addiction,sadlyprettytothinks0,2019/01/03,"Sex addict Are there any other sex addicts here? I’m newly coming to terms with my issue and wondering if there was anyone else struggling. 

I can’t stop myself anymore. I keep making terrible choices. It comes in waves. Sometimes I can ignore it or shut it down but lately it’s insatiable. I’m hungry for it. Anyone is fair game. And once we lock eyes, I know they’re mine. It’s such a fucking high. 

It used to be a sexy high but now I know it’s getting sad. It’s not cute anymore. I can’t tell anyone I know about it or my life would implode. My partners have gotten riskier as time has gone on. I hope therapy will help but I have my doubts.

addiction,Mudfeast,2019/01/03,"I really don’t know what to do My friend had been taking whatever drugs he can get his hands on for more than four years (we’re 18)
Tonight I was in the Emergency department with him, having taken his second heroin overdose in 24 hours, with his mother crying in my arms.
He was barely breathing when the paramedics came, and they told us that if he carries on like this he will die soon. I’ve known him for so long, since he was a little goofy kid. I think maybe he was too sensitive for the world
I hate what it’s made him into. He is so aggressive with other people, like the paramedics who were just trying to help him.
He wasn’t scared, I don’t even think he cares if he dies.
I just don’t know what to do. I want to help him so much. I want him to get clean and find a reason to live but he’s so anxious without alcohol or drugs that he can’t leave the house. 
I’m sorry, this is kinda a vent but I can’t talk to anyone in my life about it . I just need some advice as to what I can do to keep him alive ",1.2023466924191195,2.712430688073397,2.6874891356832435,96.23049492998553,79.27522935779818,5.873877353935296,17.895702559150163,6.5966054737557815,-0.32233394495412826,782,14,188,7,19,255,123,218,0.096,0.815,0.08900000000000001,-0.3782,0,0,3,0,0,0,19.0,1,0,1,0,12,7,2,1,8,0,22,7,3,2,0,30,40,13,2,5,9,1,1,2,1,1,4,0,1,1,12,7,1,1,7,0,0,2,7,3,0,2,12,1,26,4,26,27,3,17,0,0,0,0,32,9,0,5,8,117,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14021355076399464,0.0,0.15334365415040965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1620991385875538,0.0,0.10032924272272112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16411056907718993,0.1462942620685158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1576134115249717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2978330993115681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3327980553827499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09477161762137773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13114425196702512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11085747495058453,0.0,0.14993176585308945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416634183679493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923522320975058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413055045456563,0.16556439656189606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127537579213072,0.0,0.0,0.1577130848343788,0.0,0.0,0.15193170631607136,0.0,0.0,0.10134890552608486,0.14020071582956478,0.143811377095087,0.12670139228688956,0.12698122164187373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1357705928208239,0.0,0.0,0.14415168447960813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1054792404424,0.10639357614104383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09947561692058103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09192125956739226,0.14752823387935354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436552265345581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11869368791235264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16062162258761253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10788414755119764,0.11532918100590897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18388097796512826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13710769883297502,0.0,0.0974180562666484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17259684311371626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16926435641518586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383160665311707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924007357921638

addiction,ReallyWideChair,2019/01/03,"I need tips/advice to stop boozing and taking drugs recreationally You can say my drinking habits are of the binge variety. When the friends and I get together to drink there’s usually coke and drinks till the early morning. Staying up till 6-7am isn’t unusual. It isn’t often, it’s usually just once every 2-3 weeks (the cocaine). But I can’t do the hangovers anymore and at 26 years of age, the depressive effects last into the week. I recently decided to do a dry January and no more coke ever. My drinking wasn’t out of hand until I started doing coke. I’d like to enjoy 5-6 beers here and there with the fellas down the road and maybe get out of hand with 10 once in a blue moon.  Im doing dry January to get myself back in working condition.

addiction,curiiouscat,2019/01/04,"Support group for family/friend of person who lost their life to addiction? I lost my childhood best friend to heroin last year and want to tell other people about it. Friends get too awkward around the subject of death, my family deals with it in silence, and therapy isn't quite right.

I want to share Sam with others who can respect her and the pain of her loss. I think it will help me continue to process. 

Do you know of any support groups that would be a good place for this? Although I considered Sam family, technically I was not her family and don't want to impose on or insult groups meant for family members if it's not appropriate. I live in the bay area, if that helps.

Thank you for any guidance you can provide.",5.644184397163119,6.330463063829789,5.834893617021277,81.13333333333334,67.29787234042553,9.387234042553194,29.141843971631204,9.444778638647367,2.4043248226950364,576,19,112,11,9,183,91,141,0.133,0.64,0.227,0.9161,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,3,1,5,3,15,1,1,4,0,9,3,0,0,0,19,21,8,1,6,5,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,1,11,7,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,6,0,0,4,0,16,9,21,14,1,11,0,3,0,0,21,7,0,3,4,73,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494190860203747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864153106898768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122015279919475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14383934024706976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413061093136182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5168438315162961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3176839942285167,0.0,0.0716098489812798,0.0,0.0,0.11496208364448975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18374110667396826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07532633343642378,0.11172477670636027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09681177004547876,0.0,0.0,0.12102928976735045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2992412811147114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14584487600211554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09502234385716954,0.11967827281984225,0.14320183970140676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14578355218441272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170511978382303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3110753209150157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197992514320697,0.12618935144256527,0.1567436794777217,0.0,0.0,0.0878245446366264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2425302256364084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09736574306642756,0.0,0.0,0.08826418735465913
addiction,SkyR923,2019/01/04,"I keep fucking up I don’t know how much longer I can go like this. I have an addictive personality at heart, I’ll get hooked on literally anything. Whether it’s the internet, video games, masturbation, junk food, and the obvious one, drugs.

I can’t stay sober for longer than a month. My drug of choice has been benzos, which I was heavily addicted to last year and I still struggle with it to this day. Not only that, on Monday I took 40mg of Adderall  and two days later I took 60mg. This was last night, I just woke up from the comedown and now I feel completely worthless. 

Last year I was diagnosed with clinical depression and substance abuse disorder. These two mental illnesses combined make my life fucking miserable. 

If I’m sober, life is just boring and depressing. When I’m on drugs, the high makes things feel okay, but then they wear off and I just feel regret.

I’m also very lonely as well. I have a small group of friends that I chill with about once every two weeks. And a lot of times I honestly don’t like being around them because they are my highschool buddies (we graduated back in June) and they’re just immature and have no real goals in life. They’re still my friends, but I feel like I have trouble connecting with them. 

I’m not sure what to really do anymore. I lead a sad life. I work at fast food making shit pay, I spend all day in bed browsing the internet, I still live with my mom who I barely talk to. 

I’m trying to look for a new job but I’m not sure I can stay sober to pass a drug test, and I have social anxiety so being around new people just makes me uncomfortable.

Basically what this all comes down to: I can’t cope. I can’t cope with my negative emotions in a healthy way. I think I need to find a therapist or start going to NA. 

And honestly, I’ve been abusing drugs since I was 16. Started with weed, then alcohol, molly, ecstasy, Adderall, benzos. The list goes on.

I’m 19 years old and I feel like I’ve fried my brain from excessive drug use. I legitimately feel dumb. My memory is shit, I make stupid mistakes at work, and I have trouble holding conversations with people.


Drugs are the only thing that make the pain go away, but in the end it only intensifies the pain. 


Sorry if this post was kind of all over the place. I’m still coming down off  of 60mg of Adderall and my brain feels fried. 

Any advice or just someone to talk to would be appreciated.

addiction,nuclearqueef,2019/01/04,"It gets better. I feel like someone somewhere needs to hear this.
Stop fucking worrying! Everything really does get better! Its not just some bullshit ppl try to tell u to dismiss whatever the fuck youre going through. Its all about pushing through the tough days when you wanna relapse. The sun WILL rise the next day. This feeling of hopelessness is only MOMENTARY. 
The feeling of wanting to drop everything and go use WILL come back, except those days will get further and further apart. 
Believe me. 
So snap the fuck out of it.
This life is too short to waste it away with short bursts of synthetitic fun.

addiction,BurntJunk1E,2019/01/04,"Just releasing some thoughts, Enjoy your weekend. Hi, all we hope everyone is doing well, and staying strong, being their best selves as they can. Happy new year, we won't talk long but we wanted to let something out, also we haven't forgotten to respond to long ago responses or comments they are all important.

Anyway we always knew we were weak and pathetic, we knew that because of who we were, the choices we made/make and zero self responsibility, alas we end up here. We are trying not to think of ourselves but we are glad that this is where we are, we deserve it for all  the things we have done to others. 

We  watch ourselves degrading overtime, and selfishly always did not think of the others around me, and were glad of that. Even now it scares me watching as everything we touched and value began to shrink. Everything we say we won't do becomes something we may do, it really hit me, when i saw myself starting to steal little things, and scraping daily just for an altered state of mind(We were going through withdrawal, still are). We have lost our mind, barely thinking barely having real thought, to the point where the thought are small and meaningless.

There is more but as we said the thoughts are small and make no sense,but this reality of seeing how people like myself, make the view on responsible users worse sickens me. Nonetheless we, I have to try even when i know nothing is left i have to, for myself, but mainly for the people that cared for me and still see this other version of me.


I need to go back to reading books, I miss being able to think and speak, laugh and love, live and grow. Above all I miss giving back, but again these words are small and won't mean a think, because I can't fix the past and I can't keep letting the past define what's left of my little future. Lastly I have to remember all the people that wish they had a life, to live, to mess up, to fix, those born in truly harsh situations, I owe it to them.

Love you all, and stay strong and beautiful, and know you can grow from it all. 

P.S. Sorry for the wall Text, I have to plan better.

addiction,plskillme666,2019/01/04,"My boyfriend relapsed and won’t be honest about it I feel numb. I just found out it’s been going on much longer than I thought. I thought it was just one time, but it’s been a few. I found the syringe, the spoon, the proof is here. We agreed that if he told me he relapsed and sought help or did the right next thing that we could move on but he’s been lying about it to me for so long. We have an apartment together that I definitely can not afford by myself that still has 6 months left on the lease. He’s supposed to be my best friend and I thought if it ever came down to this that he would be honest with me. I’m stuck. Really stuck. Not to mention he works where I also work part time. I’m planning on going to an al-anon meeting on Monday but that seems so far away. I don’t know what I aim to get from this but anything said is helpful.

addiction,Nobuses123,2019/01/04,"Here I am again... not any better. Sorry for not replying to those who hiit me back the first time I posted. I meant no disrespect, just still in the same sitch where I only talk about this when I'm alone and whacked.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a bar tn bc I sniffed a 50 pc. of blow at 2 in the afternoon. those who remember me know I can't handle my comedowns. Thankfully I had a xan I just popped. Most likely fake, but thats not for me to worry. something funny in it, its not my problem anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I started down this slippery slope when I started smoking weed bc I felt I had no identity, and with the music and people I liked being a smoker gave me one, and that being one I admired. musicians, writers.... all with their vices, I felt substance abuse (starting at age ten) gave me depth and personality over others. in a way its true, bc if I can get over these hurdles, what a story I can tell. Look at my old posts here, if I havent deleted them. I have a dui, which happened bc of my budding addiction, which stemmed the guilt and despising of myself which made me further down this hole. But idk where it goes. idk guys i gotta have a smoke before my high goes dowwn so maybe ill get some sleep, but someone talk to me tomorrow if you dont mind, pce bros and sis",3.334708392603126,4.4357003127413135,4.35102621418411,88.14720991668362,72.89961389961391,7.151473277789067,26.758992074781556,7.475848149327749,1.2772888030888034,987,34,210,11,19,321,158,259,0.139,0.773,0.08800000000000001,-0.9087,0,1,3,0,1,0,46.0,0,1,2,2,13,10,1,1,13,0,12,4,1,1,2,34,30,16,0,4,12,2,2,2,1,1,2,0,0,2,19,9,1,0,5,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,9,3,37,6,23,18,4,34,0,0,1,0,15,16,0,5,16,143,56,1,0.0,0.1472410459168174,0.0,0.1354739464199528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870748050356412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692955772211706,0.3020062098480524,0.08450867451034849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12324363345846175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555687868279196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10574563452647144,0.0,0.0,0.1099077737965543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456449158255712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23863967237732964,0.0,0.0,0.10570501557027982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12985314128755882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12304802162304475,0.10989260793708956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129934120899736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06829619917890584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12142525806753995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10435650587952493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11758841011405845,0.0,0.0,0.1248471192549784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254784819115869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13040171521187188,0.0,0.16841875672726894,0.09451384419709168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08615399988893759,0.10850881471338253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23803490748014355,0.0,0.0,0.11891075108413568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14077503949541914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12436094286171052,0.0,0.10529458083319863,0.09567003778377063,0.0,0.13911142934275272,0.2638793757899857,0.0,0.09924313740599668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19976895957342125,0.10861850250807714,0.11441222063001755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246353356955203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864069079100513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11520064342482884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126203431490985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3020062098480524,0.0
addiction,riaKoob1,2019/01/04,"My friend confessed to me that he is doing cocaine and I dont know what to do He was going through an emotional breakdown, while crying and feeling hopeless. He is disconnected to his family so they dont even know. I'm the only person he confided to. 
I dont know anything about cocaine.
I dont even know for how long he has been consuming, so I would like some answers based on the long or short term.
I'm starting to consider just telling his parents. He lives with them and he is 26 years old. 
What would you guys suggest me do?

addiction,nickmaran,2019/01/04,"Addicted to tv It may not look like a big deal. But from past 4 years, I'm not able to control it or do anything else. 

I grew up a loner without any friends and I was a talented guy, I got 4 degrees, can speak 13 languages and was top in many other things. But past few years, I made few friends. 

Few years ago, a girl broke my heart and as soon as I recovered from it, another girl did the same. Same thing with friendship, I get good friends but soon either they or I mess up.

Due to all this, I started watching TV to avoid my depression but now I'm addicted to it and I can't stop it. Now I'm almost 30, wasting time in TV whereas people from my past are more successful than me. I was smarter than them all.

I don't know how to change myself. I've many goals but I'm destroying myself.

If someone can, please help me",0.5650574712643675,2.5627275747126426,2.2857471264367817,95.89229885057472,83.59770114942529,5.705747126436782,22.88505747126437,6.937597516519254,0.5639678160919535,634,23,148,8,18,208,102,174,0.159,0.701,0.14,-0.3913,0,1,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,2,4,5,12,1,1,5,0,11,3,1,3,2,29,21,15,0,1,12,0,0,1,3,1,2,1,0,3,9,5,0,3,1,3,0,1,5,5,0,0,6,3,20,7,19,14,9,22,0,2,2,0,11,6,0,5,16,92,29,2,0.14241045201527874,0.0,0.0,0.3104968265377425,0.0,0.0,0.12623827315655864,0.0,0.1426034965461285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09684399083287352,0.14932977593407304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11719166785166993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15065137528009742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597254313416587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14681892280578868,0.1226579136446801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11896565894869095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33007788588781234,0.0,0.07440358340333597,0.0,0.0,0.1194471305322841,0.1138986479189936,0.0,0.0,0.14100873723449706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168757071317698,0.09545472410234876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07826506007252704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06957455342488039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11958891270398353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13475221303753335,0.0,0.2887636922783983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40784067158133386,0.09872947627924226,0.0,0.0,0.15632391125665726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206639138531614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007988509189882,0.0,0.0,0.11906151460269693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189222352756778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830406798046273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372785938138975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2751229859632928
addiction,jaidarose,2019/01/05,"I need advice. So as of New Year’s Eve, I haven’t had any nicotine. Not by choice. I got rlly drunk and dropped my suorin in a hot tub and since then it stopped working. I’ve been to like 6 different vape shops continuously, for days as of yesterday. Yesterday I stopped searching bc everyone was out of suorins (or the one that I wanted which is a matte red one) but whatever. Anyways I kinda just took it as the universe telling me to quit and that’s the conclusion I’ve made; that I quit. However it hasn’t been easy, and Ik it’s only been 5 days but I crave the nicotine when I wake up and all throughout my day. How does someone over come that edgy/irritable feeling? And when does it go away?

addiction,1988confused,2019/01/05,"Marriage Over? Semi long question about dual addiction, marriage, and moving on. Ok here is the situation. 10 years ago I met a recovering addict (meth). After a couple years we got engaged. After a couple more we got married and we recently had our 6 year anniversary. I have scoliosis and have (had) been on opiate painkillers most of my life. With the changing laws I was forced from my regular family doctor to a pain clinic where I shot up from hydrocodone to a HUGE dose of long acting morphine. My husband (who had also dabbled in heroin in his previous life) took my pills, I took too many and I ended up without and found out what morphine withdrawal is like. Long story short I began supplementing with h when the withdrawal was bad. My husband brought it home and I never dealt with dealers (my point with that is that I literally did not do it unless he was bringing it home - I was a sheltered kid in that respect). Soon I was addicted to it even though I never had the euphoria effect from it that I got from pills. We quit several times with subs and methadone. But my husband ENJOYS the high. He is addicted physically and psychologically. His only reason for quitting has been money and me. After putting myself back together I ended up with a great (executive) job. We are about to buy a house and cars...and its a contract job. I have to work very hard to lose it. My husband, who has not been able to keep a job for the last several years due to his use, also has a great job on the horizon. I have tried very hard to be supportive and not nag because 1) I  knew he was an addict when we got together and 2) its not like I wasn't right there with him for awhile. But he just won't give up. If he does it is only a week or two before he is back in it...and he has this ""friend"" who keeps dragging him back in. I am petrified of signing a home title, buying a car, and having my salary checks dump into our account. I am scared because my work now carries a (free) life insurance policy on me of 3x my salary and my state is a community property state as well. I love him a lot. We get along great and he should be my partner for life. I really believe in ""through better or worse"" and this is my only marriage. But I am also supporting a disabled (adult) son...not to mention my animal kingdom. I am scared that 1) the money will only make it worse or he will do something stupid while in addict mode and 2) that this is going to ruin such a great career opportunity for me. It's hard to lose, not impossible. I grew up in foster care and don't have any family so I guess I am looking for advice? stories? Am I being selfish or hypocritical? I worry that if I leave him, it will be worse and he will kill himself with drugs. If I give him an ultimatum he will stop. But if he does it just to make me happy, the first time we have a fight his addict brain will be like ""Hey she's a bitch anyway, you don't care if she leaves"".

addiction,CanadianStatement,2019/01/05,"Quit cigarettes, cocaine and substantially cut down on my drinking in the final quarter of 2018. This is a self-reflectory post, since it's now the new year.

As of today, I am one-month smoke-free.

As of today, I am 3 months without cocaine.

As of today, I have cut my drinking down by 80%.

My reason? Found the right woman.
I found somebody who forces me (not literally, but internally) to become a better version of myself. For me, that's what it came down to.

My addictions never got to the point where my life was in shambles, but it could have easily gone that way, had I not made these changes. 

If you're struggling, try to find something or someone that makes you want to be a better version of yourself. Never settle for a lesser version of yourself.

That's all I wanted to say. Take away from this post what you will.

Step Work For Today


Psalm 29:11  (NASB)
The Lord will give strength to His people;
The Lord will bless His people with peace.


STEP 3. We made a decision to turn our lives and our wills over to the care of God.


Why wont you get out of the way and let go! Not letting go and doing it your way is not working like fist fighting the wind or running uphill in the mud! Exhausted, frustrated, and madder then hell your right back where you started from thats the life of addiction. There is a better way and the Steps will help you find and lean on God but you keep interfering .God does not need you to help carry the load ,He wants you to trust Him to carry it for you. Wouldn't it be nice to sit down rest and experience peace ,a peace that transcends all understanding.Even though it appears the whole world is coming to an end you will have the super - natural presence of Gods Holy Spirit and the light of his precious words as your guide ! It is in-explainable with words and when you do finally give God control you will receive that super-natural peace that transcends all understanding. 

Romans 15:13 — ""May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.""

addiction,Maseymoe,2019/01/05,"While bored at work I found this on my phone. I wrote this note 3 days into a meth bender. From one human to another. I ask you to look into yourself and find what makes you the person you hope you are. What makes you think that people see you that way? What has happened to make you think that? In our life we gather our thoughts together too few of times. And even when we do we don't come out with definititive conclusions about ourselves that stay with us throughout our time on this earth. I know nothing of myself or who I was or will be other than that I'm lost in my own mind more times than I'm found. When I do find what I believe to hold some merit I tirelessly chase it. Only to be shown by the world I'm wrong again. My endless search for something real and satisfying is a search ill be on till my bodies laying still and deep. And when it does I don't know if Ill ever be someone that makes me feel proud of myself. Do you? Is there something I'm missing? I so fear in my search I'm missing the obvious. That there's something everyone else can see and I'm too focused on finding it to see it. It's causing me to be uncertain inmy actions and to not trust myself. And he only really thing I know anymore and can say with confidence is that I don't know. Whether the question be about my health. My mind. Or my drug use. The reason I have for the actions I will do is simply that I don't know. Once I do know I think my life will make sense again. Once I'm sure of myself and when my thoughts have meaning again i hope that my actions will follow in suit. And a domino effect starting with this will help me create a life I can project confidently to the world. But for now I just sit in my room. Filling my lungs and nose with things I can't help but do. Searching for things I know I'll never find.

FUCK YOU MASON YOU PEICE OF SHIT. ID RATHRR DIE THAN BE YOU ANYMORE. FUCK YOU EAT A DICK FUCKING FAGGOT CANT EVEN SEE YOUR KID LIFES NOT HARD YOUR JUST FUCKED IN THE HEAD GET SOME HELP EVERYONE HATES YOU YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT A GIRL WHO NEEDS TO LET YOU GO. YOUR DRAGGING THE WORLD DOWN TO HELL WITH YOU SO YOU DONT HAVE TO BE LONELY WHEN YOU DIE.

Forever wishing I was a child at SES again hanging upside down on the playground and instead of fearing the fall into the sky I'm welcoming and accepting the fall.

addiction,GirlgangHQ,2019/01/05,"Addiction, mental illness or depression? Help. My brother is 22, he is a game Addict, he plays from phone, tablet or laptop - and will always have at least one of these in his hands. If he’s not playing, he will be watching other people play. 

His addiction is so bad that he will not leave his room or the house for days, even weeks. All his friends have dropped off over the last year and we are quickly watching him socially withdraw. 

He is a lovely guy, smart, good looking, funny but the gaming has been his outlet to what I think is chronic anxiety or some form of mental illness.  

I encouraged him into university straight out of high school and he went and completed a 3 year it degree, which is  a wonderful achievement however it did not improve his social life or give him any desire to get out of his room or the house, now that he’s finished his degree his addiction seems to have worsened. 

We don’t know what to do, we don’t know how to help,  what can we do, how can we motivate him? Should he see a doctor or therapist?

addiction,Help_Me_Reddit01,2019/01/05,"Always curious as to how people become addicted. I’m a drug an alcohol counselor. I’m also fresh out of surgery. 

I was given a few different benzos before surgery, I don’t think I could tell you my name. I felt like I was floating through life and I laid there thinking omg I hate this. 

I was given fentanyl as a part of my anesthesia cocktail. For hours, I felt like shit and nodding off. 

I’m currently taking Percocet only at 5mg. I can’t function. I’m sweating like a whore in church. I don’t feel “good”. I’m nodding off with these as well. 

Most of my clients tell me it all starts with a prescription. Not only for opioids but there’s a fair share of clients who began using benzos too. 

I just have to know, for those who became addicted because of scripts did you initially like the feeling right off the bat? I just don’t know how people genuinely like this! 

Don’t get me wrong - I know the affects on the brain and things of that nature.

addiction,InGenScientist,2019/01/05,"When does it end.... Hey everyone. 

Currently I have a family member that’s severely addicted to opiates. He’s had addiction problems in the past, went to rehab and has relapsed again. 

I believe he’s high 24/7 now. He’s overdosed a few times this month and spent Christmas in the hospital cause of it. He gets so high at this point that he’s just never makes sense anymore.

I think his mind is completely gone. The entire family has spoken to him and tried to get through to him. He’s lying about getting help and just doesn’t care. 

Is there any hope for him or do we just wait for the inevitable phone call from the police saying he has finally died? 

Is there anything you can even say to someone like this to help or is it a loss cause?",3.342755102040816,5.06331791836735,4.1181122448979615,87.35635204081635,73.89795918367345,7.621088435374148,25.855442176870746,8.344100000000001,1.629254421768708,582,20,118,10,12,186,96,147,0.1,0.809,0.091,-0.3313,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,1,1,0,1,11,5,0,0,8,0,12,3,0,3,1,19,23,8,1,2,5,0,0,1,0,0,3,2,0,0,8,5,0,1,1,0,1,2,2,2,0,0,4,2,9,3,16,19,1,18,0,1,0,0,20,6,0,3,11,71,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32064260707388675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000084607831494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14584782159841006,0.0,0.0,0.12102101759397148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16569059783835627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150168633197035,0.0,0.14994139599026374,0.30215016834502384,0.0,0.0,0.15419364833093904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15262905752916126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869656585760136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302549199096045,0.0,0.0,0.09713428568886467,0.0,0.0,0.14052581060493466,0.0,0.0,0.2772774181687272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16110125884622947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23050437478643684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1971475968690796,0.3107620630008912,0.0,0.14606758563954247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07184796844757235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816626159798597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14849256493601,0.0,0.1173849617042414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11342470703392832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14038908509392645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13902287313804249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14072024268983627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23390215187405086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661402900221323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12460672255184416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942325766653562,0.0,0.0,0.08575411337579962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984670037460694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363296619773011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Iamso_Tired,2019/01/06,"My girlfriends brother is an addict Hey guys, 
So my GFs brother is an addict, and I wanted to see if you all might be able to give me advice as to how I can help. 
Her bro (lets call him A) recently admitted to having been using for about a year (Heroin, snorting, not shooting). He is kind of a difficult person in general, sort of snippy, generally pretty private, but not a bad guy, I would definitely say I like him. My girlfriend has told me stories about when they thought he might be using but weren’t sure, and how he was irritable, defensive, and often downright mean. Once he admitted to using heroine, he started going to NA meetings, and was full of energy (I think thats called the “Pink cloud”?) but now it has been about 6 months or so, and he has stopped going. My GF and her family has been very concerned, especially since he was recently drug tested and came up positive for heroin again. We were just at her mothers house for the holidays, where he lives with their mother, and he was being sort of ill tempered, but mostly walked around the house with headphones on or stayed in his room with the door open. He was very defensive a few times, but mostly when being provoked by GF and A’s other sibling, who is pretty antagonistic.

My GF and her family have asked him again if he was using, and he repeatedly denies it, and nobody is sure if he is using consistently again, or if he used once and the recent drug test caught it. My GF is very distraught, and I’ve been trying to be supportive, but i also kind of think the family is handling it poorly. The family is very wary , judgy, and kind of always wondering whether he is using again or not, whispering when he’s not in the room, and asking him whether he is using again. My GF often will tell me a new development, and a lot of the time he seems to be being a bit of a dick, but not being as bad as what she has told me about when he was using consistently. I try to be supportive but I also think the family is focusing so much on his every move that he may be feeling claustrophobic, and he seems like he needs space (not to be ignored, just not being constantly under a microscope).  For instance, my GF recently asked A about his addiction over text (GFs therapist told her to send one, i think its a good idea though, and it was worded very tactfully), he was pretty understanding and non defensive, but denied using. Then a week later he comes to drop off something and brings a girl with him who he is apparently dating. GF hasnt heard anything about her, but that isnt really out of the ordinary, as it seems like a new relationship, and she seemed “pretty normal and cool”.  My GF is now freaking out thinking he introduced this girl to her to show he was ok and not using again, and wondering whether this girl knows about his addiction. She asks me about it and I say it seems normal that he wouldnt have told anybody about a new girl he was dating, and i dont think its suspicious for him to bring her around.  GF doesnt like that I have been playing the devils advocate, saying that he may be irritable because he doesnt like living at his mothers house full time, or that he is constantly under a microscope, or that it was the holidays, which are hard for the whole family as they lost their father a few years ago. 
My GF is constantly anxious about her brother using again, and dissects everything he does, often to me. I feel like she is overthinking it a lot of the time, but i concede that im not in the situation, and he isnt my brother. 

Am I completely wrong for trying to give him the benefit of the doubt if i think the family is handling the situation poorly? How can I be a better, more supportive partner, without being dishonest about how I feel about the situation?


Tl;DR: My GF and her family are constantly anxious about their addict family member, I think they are being overbearing and making him feel like he’s on trial, how can I be supportive without lying to my GF or condoning what I think are bad behaviors?

(I hope I’m not just being a bad BF, but I am unsure. I haven’t been in this situation before and this is my first GF (we are 25))",9.039002463054187,6.479492185960591,9.326965517241383,69.51458620689657,61.869458128078826,12.82679802955665,36.377339901477825,11.322745342581037,3.920025221674877,3253,107,623,72,35,1092,293,812,0.087,0.76,0.152,0.9948,2,0,4,1,0,0,98.0,2,1,6,3,46,39,4,2,45,2,91,9,1,19,3,165,159,80,0,12,42,9,5,7,17,7,8,5,3,8,31,45,0,5,27,4,2,10,21,16,0,2,29,14,80,23,80,104,13,79,1,1,2,1,130,26,1,34,48,442,111,2,0.04154266744717048,0.0,0.0,0.22643819722718345,0.0,0.040595013832610036,0.03682506815079375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644331229709975,0.03456682722974913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938627791302708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03418607564435553,0.07396356316988477,0.15534714486086806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13874556832003535,0.02532402449069639,0.0,0.03534975023550678,0.0,0.0,0.03674111342796076,0.0453538333957732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08483941642445822,0.04751374446667805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03578532956657442,0.043556696436034735,0.17957146082961153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036354268234114605,0.0,0.048687696854440986,0.0,0.09635261062939764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03500148904479631,0.0,0.03733587081485644,0.0,0.3524645669982329,0.0,0.08402088351513291,0.059356179849752076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03533617170848171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797030240483996,0.047219310522747984,0.03484401847617946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226754420314153,0.0,0.0,0.03721407022119886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02784517430799141,0.0,0.0,0.041261242312595814,0.0,0.14380398182620902,0.0,0.04689661495699462,0.04487320960046934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12978088616497815,0.02283076359435321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042480192066563824,0.0,0.14206954239451308,0.0,0.07336587290560245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045348728891520834,0.07063618056747606,0.0,0.0,0.027730053105085715,0.0,0.0,0.04525214350024823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08814041045629623,0.0,0.0,0.03315896081616547,0.04415328106205089,0.030538640534249876,0.030803361526849024,0.0,0.1203665012676697,0.0,0.0,0.08140598750952525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08848317005048315,0.028150386594886674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03627345483948791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16905531060923618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026613296527452673,0.0,0.1640734894373491,0.04460127792897498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991091896637071,0.0,0.0,0.03310412740810903,0.18909442105215468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034364523802379615,0.1867827951206171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031981574991932084,0.0,0.0,0.02940411383804317,0.04427895607089829,0.0,0.034731530143346616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18856850686466814,0.07830694486336688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03631012241601436,0.0,0.0,0.04823423880697869,0.0,0.2395697749267961,0.040815459843201715,0.032980237592069785,0.09689545386290853,0.0,0.0,0.15878319607069571,0.0,0.08461423279295695,0.0,0.0,0.04324738189336027,0.0,0.4305543173559327,0.0,0.17138525672004298,0.024502941593740675,0.0,0.033323022011048344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04638090463058267,0.0,0.08009129793105482,0.09010250150981376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029510719037112325,0.04542038537629022,0.0,0.05350423161224808
addiction,FancyGuacamo,2019/01/06,"This is probably dumb question. What is it that you do that has dire consequences for you. I will start the beginning 

I use pills. When I don’t have them it’s no big deal for me. ) I know I am grateful. So many others battle many diseases that  are kr even harder for rben.

When I use pills I will steal anything. One time I ended up with  six of straws and crackers. Makes no sense . Plus I feel horribly guilty and it hurts my sobriety so much.

Any advice?",0.1805267558528385,2.579117336956521,1.53521739130435,96.66061872909701,93.02173913043478,5.004682274247492,17.94648829431438,6.67199483983844,0.03282675585284256,353,10,77,5,13,112,67,92,0.26,0.71,0.03,-0.9685,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,1,0,5,4,2,0,1,0,10,2,0,3,0,10,17,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,9,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,4,0,2,0,1,14,0,7,15,1,8,0,1,0,0,5,2,1,1,6,53,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310932114754299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1608198624501849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946093685537773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2438086118472557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.209458061240874,0.0,0.0,0.1561980090619714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11957537373049025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2531651580959505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299675497392531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15785749089438011,0.4795231678644942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1738457965368255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16025030239702698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549739242059121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26492053939170235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16738733297250458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13789797992728753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084991830222708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,offcocaine,2019/01/06,"Quit cocaine 2 weeks with Topiramate- miracle drug for me Hi all

Just wanted to post this for others who may be suffering with cocaine addiction and see no way out. I am quit 2 weeks now  (full disclosure , I slipped new year's eve, but that honesty made me realize more how much I hate coke). I was a daily user of coke, half g to a g so this is a big milestone for me.  Toparamada has made a hugh difference for me quitting this time. I have quit for 12 days before without it so I have a sense of what it was like quitting without it and quitting with it.

So my story, I am a working professional and an addict. I have been using coke for about the last 8 months regularly. Started when I was in Mexico in March 2018 with my family, i got offered a sample on the beaches of Cancun by a Mexican pot dealer. I was trying to buy weed innocently enough and I was dumb enough to take it. That sample turned into an addiction that would become a daily addiction I had to feed for the last 8 months

I have realized I have had a problem for the last several months and wanted to quit but the time was never right. There was a birthday. A party. A holiday. Etc
I was finally sick of being sick and quit on xmas eve  I actually did quit in August 2018 cold Turkey for 12 and it was hell. I had pain when I slept, runny nose, looked sick for 10 days plus and had hallucinations.

With Topiramate it has been way easier. I had tiredness for the first few days but no  pain or hallucinations. I was able to go out. I was able to function. I didn't look that sick as I did before. Everyone reacts to meds differently so your mileage may vary but for me it's been a miracle drug.

Anyway, just wanted to post this give hope to those addicted to coke and mini brag I have lasted this long.  I will never underestimate coke again and know this is a forever battle. There is help out there though. You need to want it. I wanted it bad this time. I am honestly happy as fuck to be sober now. All the shit I took for granted before. Like fresh air, eating a good meal, warm bed without being coked up praying to god or whoever you believe in that you will live the night. Life is good all.

addiction,uber_thot,2019/01/06,"Social Media You’re probably thinking this isn’t worth your time, drug addiction is way worse. And you’re definitely right. Yet I still feel like it’s taken over my life. I open my phone and I immediately open Instagram or Snapchat.(It’s a gut reaction at this point) I check how many likes I got or how many people viewed my story, I obsess over that tiny bit of happiness I get when I see 400 likes on my insta post. I don’t even really enjoy any of it anymore. It’s good for about a second, then back to no feeling at all. It’s started to take over all my free time and my grades have dropped. I’ve lost all happiness and recently started taking anti depressants. I finally made the decision to get off social media and try and take back some of my life. I’m sure someone can relate with me and that’s the only reason I’m really typing this. If you’ve actually managed to sit through all of this I’m mildly impressed.

addiction,-F-ilipson,2019/01/06,"„MDMA“ Addict Dear Redditors,
 I'm still kinda addicted to it, but I decided to stop with it. I first tried Molly on the 2nd of November and was abusing it till NYE. 5 days ago, I decided to quit, because I was having many problems with my family and quite often depressions. Since Molly in Czech republic isn't very clean, often few mg of Molly and the rest some sort of shit, like „mňau mňau„ what's supposed to be fertilizer, I said enough. I've spend more more than 5000 CZK(~200$) and that's not what I want. I want to be clean, find a GF, have friends and to be able to have fun without drugs. 

To everyone who's in similar situations like me, I trust you can do it, get out of that shit and have a beautiful life. Just believe in yourself.

addiction,Hunter3200,2019/01/06,"Do you have a coke addiction? You CAN stop it, pretty fast. Hello! You may be wondering, what's my story? And what do I mean by, you can stop it fast. Well listen up because this may help you.

All my life, I've  drank Mountain Dews and other soda beverages. Every single day I would drink about five. Maybe even 10 or more! Every time I'd finish one, I'd just go for another. Now this was very detrimental to my health, and I knew it. I just couldn't stop!

Looking back on it now, I don't understand why I couldn't stop and why I didn't. I'm glad I did stop, like hell, I barely drink sodas at all now (unless you consider Gingerelle or Sprite a soda, which I don't drink too often, only sometimes.)

How did I quit? You may be asking. Well here is what i did. A couple if months ago, probably November of last year, I started buying flavored water. Now any kind will do, as long as you enjoy the flavor, but I recommend *Nestle: Splash*

Every day I would drink these, and soon I went one month without soda. I may have drank one or two but you get the point. Every time you consider a soda, force yourself to drink your water. At first it's a rough road, but just keep on going because soon you won't even consider going back to sodas. 

Every month since then (its January currently) I've drank only water and a few sodas. Do as I done. Only drink one or two sodas a week, however none is better!

Trust me, it's possible to beat this addiction. If you keep working hard enough soda won't become an essential need in life. Now if you are really brave, after drinking only flavored water for a year, switch to real water.

Yes a nightmare it sounds indeed, but you can do it! I'm not there yet hahahaha but I'm sure I can get there! 

Only save sodas for the special occasions like going out to eat(Unless you eat fast food every day.) I get water every time I go out.

Well. I hope this inspires you and helps you quit your soda addiction. This is Hunter, signing out, peace!",1.1725757575757572,3.510541712121213,3.1765656565656566,88.31818181818184,83.89898989898991,5.822222222222222,18.848484848484848,7.1686216300943375,0.48010303030303003,1522,39,303,22,44,512,188,396,0.052000000000000005,0.799,0.14800000000000002,0.9914,2,0,7,0,0,0,69.0,0,19,0,6,25,17,1,0,13,1,36,36,0,1,3,58,63,25,0,9,18,0,2,2,0,9,6,2,0,0,20,10,30,7,5,7,1,6,10,1,3,8,11,8,45,16,27,39,7,56,1,0,1,0,24,11,1,14,41,201,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2157543369109015,0.0,0.0,0.058479298530200036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04486253264687761,0.06917633082216187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061673966378912974,0.0,0.0,0.10145523200734907,0.0,0.08043060135629974,0.07285977083866557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058345975944632325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07299564109936778,0.0,0.1276374847671762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06751122320281447,0.0,0.4523851552907394,0.0,0.13500957648083894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06816566358076585,0.0,0.08714642798666218,0.0,0.38908380642484575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056114886896962035,0.0797723780030006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10340135182689476,0.0,0.18746415791700816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0590970453354723,0.0,0.0,0.07012407305896906,0.0,0.0,0.08843792246708372,0.0,0.0,0.06552407444419629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11727608688593395,0.0,0.06869862991588314,0.0,0.05377515853075676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319451665625783,0.06446018276553946,0.0,0.0,0.058382246527022334,0.05539901293045326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06627672242994684,0.07186174369172016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1579722346130634,0.0,0.0,0.0489166501223014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17881458952710022,0.2508695376801056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062363905373384425,0.07437237426849402,0.0,0.0671162096479387,0.07112788075125655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14033652804691366,0.0,0.07508942482997577,0.04226270284493947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05457188125378135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0652469919192092,0.0,0.04669460336392749,0.0,0.0,0.2757734909473112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06217687346702223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11540463719167852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888813451123235,0.06867812290353817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0544329724000271,0.0,0.0,0.052917945572641636,0.0,0.17794751733673397,0.061155764855296835,0.1190571072710214,0.0,0.0,0.06359367621808994,0.07154272006413956,0.048027663438759666,0.0,0.0,0.0937277911527749,0.0,0.0,0.08496630393918712

addiction,zipongj,2019/01/06,"It makes me so sad when I hear people who have never suffered with addiction discuss addicts. I’ve dealt with substance abuse and addiction for a long time. In my life I’ve personally used more drugs than most have probably even heard of- and I’ve been hooked to my fair share of them. Throughout my many soirées with dependency I’ve learned a good deal about how addiction works, and because of that whenever I see others discuss it it makes me so sad, and sometimes even angry at their ignorance. 

When people discuss addicts most of the time they do so with a tone of disgust and animosity. “Ugh, these people make me sick. We shouldn’t even narcan them, do the world a favor,” “addiction is a choice. You got yourself here, it’s your fault.”

I can understand their resentment. Perhaps they have personally been hurt by an addict, maybe it was their family or friend. Maybe they have been stolen from, lied to, or betrayed. After this it can be hard to find pity for them, because from the outside it is so easy to say “why are you choosing to do something that hurts you and everyone around you? Why do you keep doing it?” But that’s not how it works. When you are gripped by addiction you don’t get to make a choice, the choice has been made for you. The only choice you get is the choice to live or die, and our inherent desire for self preservation is a powerful driver. The heroin addict isn’t choosing to be a heroin addict, they’ve fallen into the same trap that so many others have fallen into before them. The trap of escapism. 

The healthy, happy person doesn’t choose to shoot up. There has to be some deep discontent that drives them to any avenue of relief. If you live your whole life being miserable and one day you discover a cure for that misery, it’s not quite as simple as “just don’t do it.” It can seem like the only option, the only escape from the incessantly servile rat race of every day life. Imagine being given the cure for your constant debilitating pain and being told you can’t have it and “you just need stronger will power.”

I see this attitude with other, non substance, addictions as well. Particularly with food addiction. There’s this disgusting attitude I notice on Reddit where people shame the obese under a bullshit guise of benevolence because “shame makes people change.” No. Shame doesn’t make people want to change, it makes them hate themselves even more. It makes them apathetic, miserable, and desperate for any sense of comfort. That shame is what drives them to overindulge in the first place, and the lack of empathy and arrogance of these people who insult and degrade other human beings disgusts me. 

I hate the lack of empathy. I hate the ignorance. I hate that we cannot just for once reach a hand out to the people who need it. I hate that we can’t just for once say “I’m here for you, you’re loved, and you can get better.” 

These people are what’s wrong with the world, not the addicts. The addicts are sick, the others are hateful fools. 

Something I wrote a long time ago on a dark and lonely night. 

The darkest sky, birth to the brightest day. 
The forgotten hours in which he waste away. 
The lonely man looks to a new days sky
He was void and cold but could never cry. 

The sunrise now, no beacon of hope.
A symbol of deviancy with unknown scope. 
His eyes burned and his head fought back,
Worries and fears, the minds payback. 

Dawn had come, and so he went.
To uphold his ungodly covenant. 
With his rites the battles ceased.
Quelled his demon, fed the beast. 

The darkest sky, the most forgotten hours. 
The only time free from the souls devour. 
His spirit cursed, forever corrupted and unclean. 
His reflection blighted, such is the fate of the fiend.

addiction,AllUserNamesGone99,2019/01/06,"Suffering addict constantly substituting drug of choice This is my first Reddit post. I am currently hopped up on Adderall that I constantly abuse. As soon as I pick up my RX I crush it and put it up my nose. I run out quickly and also sell half of it to a friend because I’m over prescribed.

Prior to this, I was a hardcore alcoholic who always drank to excess, read: blackout. I had been trying to quit that substance for over six years. In three weeks I’ll be celebrating one year sober of alcohol. I don’t believe I will ever tempt myself with that again.

But it goes so much deeper. As an addict. I crave constant stimulation. Right now I can only take drugs I’m prescribed as I am subject to random drug tests for a DUI I received almost s year ago.

As mentioned, I am prescribed 15mg IR adderall 2x a day, 4 mg of lorazepam, 3 mg of lunesta, and 1 mg of clonazepam. I get so hopped up my body doesn’t shut down so need these benzodiazepines to shut my brain off.

When I am not taking adderall, I crave chaos. I spend a lot of time looking for trouble. I gamble. I flirt with the idea of taking on new women even though I’m married. I go to strip clubs, push the envelope by taking drugs I know don’t show up on the 10 panel tests.

I’m a workaholic and sometimes adderall helps, but it always ends with me overdoing it and being completely unable to focus. I don’t need it but can’t bring myself to kick it. When I do take it I become a zombie unable to care about anything except pushing work through. I’m a garbage human being with no concern for anyone. I have a lot of feelings that are masked by this constant abuse of drugs.

Has anyone dealt with a several layered addiction such as this and been able to find balance? I’m thinking I want to use marijuana semi regularly once I get through this probationary period. I’m much calmer and introspective, it relaxes my impulsive nature and helps me face up to the fucked up reality my actions cause.

Any consents or similar experiences are greatly appreciated thanks.

She is constantly nodding during conversations, has been taking money from my little sister's bank account, and frequently goes to the bathroom with her purse, amongst other things.

addiction,HandoTrius,2019/01/07,"I have bad dreams that have woken me up several times each night for the past 19 months  

I posted this in r/mentalhealth but thought it fits well here too

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR after quitting drug use I started having nightmares/bad dreams about using drugs, guilt, shame, and death. These dreams cause me to fully wake up at least 2 times and up to 6 times a night, making it very hard to get enough restorative sleep. I started using at 12 and stopped in may 2017 which makes me a 30 year old man (kind of hard to believe)

I started having depressive symptoms at 5 years old and I have spent far more time in a depression than out of it over my whole life. The depression led to low self confidence, a lot of shame about being broken or less than everyone else. This brutal toxic shame has been a heavy burden I have carried since childhood that I am just now starting to heal. I really want to hammer the point that I felt like everyone else had something that I didn't, I wasn't cool or good enough, I was terrified of everyone finding out how much of a sorry sad sack I was, sooo afraid of rejection and filled with negative self talk. It makes sense that the first time I smoked weed at 12 years old that I knew I was going to be a pot smoker. For a kid who is in pain like that it's just logical that they would become attached to the thing that alleviates that pain. I self medicated my depression and ignored the voice that told me I was less than, using drugs was fun and it allowed me to connect with people. The depression would cycle, when It got really bad I would withdraw from life and consider quitting my substance use but eventually I would start feeling a little better and I went back to the party. Life was really centered around drugs and partying, it was fun when the depression wasn't bad. This way of life continued until I was 23, that's when all my friends graduated college and started moving on with their lives and I started isolating. I moved in with my aunt and became a live in nanny for her two young boys. I was no longer having any good phases, I was depressed all the time. I hated myself and I hated living so I drank. I gave up on life, really let myself go. I gained 100lbs and drank my pain away for about 5 years. I honestly don't remember much from those years it feels like how I imagine waking up from a coma feels, just a blur, time lost and then I woke up. I woke up when the suicidal thoughts got really loud and I came to a crossroads either find a way to end the pain or end it by killing myself. It wasn't easy and it didn't take right away but finally in may 2017 a change happened inside me and I began to live my life for the first time in earnest. So I have told you all of this so you can understand why I can't get a good nights sleep. It makes sense to me that my subconscious is stuck in the past and when I dream those old fears, thoughts, anxieties come through and over time by continuing to live a positive life my subconscious will heal and I will finally be able to rest. I guess I want to know if anyone has a different way of thinking about the bad dreams or has an idea of a way to help me rest. In the beginning I had tons of dreams where I would realize I was using drugs and be totally shattered that I gave up on my clean time and ruined my life. After about a year those dreams went away, I have none of them now. Now I mostly have guilt and shame dreams, in them I realize that the people I am with all found out something terrible about me or just really don't like me even though they are trying to or dreams where I accidentally hurt people by crashing my car into them, stuff like that. I wake up, wide awake feeling this intense guilt or shame and it takes a while to fall back asleep. Wow didn't know I was going to write this book, if you made it this far thanks for reading and I hope you are doing well on your journey!",5.565965350658004,5.537340627075351,5.7871755788772274,83.88896926536735,67.37803320561942,9.260802931867401,28.260564162363266,8.964715089967882,1.92959161530346,3073,88,643,48,46,978,325,783,0.234,0.632,0.134,-0.9988,2,0,9,0,0,1,60.0,0,5,6,7,35,58,4,10,39,1,59,30,6,16,5,117,126,53,3,10,17,1,7,5,1,9,22,2,1,6,46,40,2,2,22,11,1,14,12,38,2,3,46,10,93,20,102,66,22,129,0,13,0,0,28,49,0,16,66,435,139,4,0.04428241460305635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04797997772141415,0.05380798069452709,0.030113560438778712,0.0,0.033875925965039286,0.0,0.0,0.030963293907880687,0.0,0.0,0.03942073741380885,0.0,0.0,0.12481435862256444,0.06810088687884767,0.1848698325792919,0.0,0.04890644783645373,0.0,0.049891117142194984,0.0,0.039164197144150766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05064728533604116,0.0,0.04549023794983812,0.046844923011396485,0.038145379147577874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2669826516696828,0.0,0.0,0.046265698228689464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2567677110168604,0.0,0.07398455041104057,0.0,0.07844215124260878,0.09151114344106098,0.0,0.029248117207920005,0.0,0.0,0.12694123450322362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04983002767252582,0.08956207744396143,0.03163536584046826,0.042518062428875694,0.09701844138064517,0.0809466494072233,0.07533319847935549,0.0,0.04855338196243605,0.03421248367504246,0.0,0.04627146788167093,0.0,0.07550015012268574,0.11142596521233944,0.07083338446724813,0.0,0.04878207212883282,0.0,0.03915879298856267,0.0,0.07933669106337674,0.08743943320781222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02968156907519025,0.0,0.0,0.043982429425051,0.0,0.0,0.04740524070325499,0.04998945601281979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0489919307727218,0.04611332044752989,0.04867291396130001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04528176915700607,0.2502238321657761,0.108170754919467,0.044382612839993216,0.19551091692971603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04833948655438839,0.03764732534138675,0.0,0.04190109140140381,0.1182354224244994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044609873966282215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035345800857281034,0.09413039740702474,0.06510533986634813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12466813899580576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18586778008793645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18847844512009365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454515079654383,0.09209955182933413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04186119514120644,0.0,0.04241031239973262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09419959752101124,0.04429439805334338,0.0,0.1702106922644913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050163343404441285,0.037816940116007405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13858864820027456,0.050026524013263116,0.0,0.03663087096149432,0.0,0.08862878966658122,0.0,0.0,0.06818153240893708,0.0,0.04957053769343996,0.2194032468346629,0.0,0.0,0.037022081443423976,0.0,0.0,0.050692770245628134,0.048437774249018566,0.0,0.0,0.04602638420629868,0.06658972953400757,0.035592527469884186,0.0,0.04076929783646077,0.0,0.0,0.029419268594282837,0.028374383232105282,0.04350724751340347,0.10546587240334844,0.2582143206478717,0.0,0.0,0.08462748966881574,0.0,0.03006485274143892,0.0,0.043257484580683486,0.04609955530501041,0.0,0.22947472998137866,0.0,0.03653762967714829,0.052237830901366585,0.14059727814067527,0.0,0.0,0.07963041766469564,0.08210048396712152,0.039957991490273036,0.04943973448811767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15728478404733784,0.0,0.05380798069452709,0.1710985388902536

addiction,hannahdd,2019/01/07,What are some things you wish you had in the beginning of your recovery? I’m trying to figure out in what ways I can help people in recovery on social media and put out content they really need. Being a recovering addict I have some foundational things I think would help because it would have helped me but I was hoping to get some other information. Is there anything you would have liked in the beginning of your recovery or after you left rehab? Is there something you wish you had back then? This is also 100% open to those of you that are just starting recovery. Thank you in advance for helping me!!,5.58045652173913,6.887453773913047,6.125815217391306,76.7469836956522,67.78260869565217,9.228260869565217,28.28804347826087,9.516144504307137,2.5702391304347816,484,16,86,10,8,157,73,115,0.0,0.81,0.19,0.9708,0,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,10,1,1,5,3,0,0,3,0,16,2,0,0,0,20,27,5,0,7,3,0,0,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,9,4,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,17,3,16,20,3,19,0,0,0,0,17,10,0,5,7,73,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1931203008084564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14166726964192722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14577984838120822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362178754159333,0.0,0.10798936061165787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09255387611076092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.474961248082013,0.0,0.0,0.1759505159622982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1924746436388195,0.0,0.0,0.08654683421953542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13135492414312908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12281391968037378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17808528084657715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11348720961883092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18058272610071266,0.0,0.1363791855438045,0.0,0.0,0.12538810542886838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630964701931665,0.0,0.0,0.2353819721222231,0.1135109505105542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202736279313784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406138994317154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074288913224202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3775281074908333,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,StillS3arching,2019/01/07,"The truth is... love isn't strong enough to fight demons. I though that having a family of my own would be the final nail in the coffin of my addiction. Sealed up never to see the light of day again. Love conquers all right?

addiction,selectedambientwork,2019/01/07,"Porn makes me feel horrible. There’s nothing wrong with sex. It’s natural.

But Porn? It just doesn’t feel right. 

The sex on screen? It’s all fake. 

Ever since I was around nine years old, I used to browse pornographic websites. Eleven years later and I still consume pornography excessively. I’m like a goddamn animal. I’ll spend hours watching porn. 

And whenever I watch porn, it just doesn’t feel right. When I’m done, I feel like shit. I feel like a goddamn perverted loser that lives alone and watches porn during most of his free time. 

The only thing that keeps me sane is the fact that I’m aware of how fake it is and that it isn’t a real *human* connection. 

I really want to stop.

addiction,dustresssed,2019/01/07,"Can I share some of my pain and insanity? I’m going to start this by saying I’ve been completely sober for about 3 full days now, and I’m going back to meetings tomorrow. I’m also trying to get psychiatric help. I gave my gun to my husband to take out of the house, and I am not suicidal. 

I have been an addict for many years; I’m 32 so about 20 years. I’ve had some stretches of clean time working a program, but I always, slowly, slip back. I’m a chronic pain sufferer and have serious depression.

I’ll skip over all the grief and tragedy of the last 10+ years. Last week, I seriously fucked up. 

I decided for some stupid terrible reason that huffing duster would be a good idea, that hey, at least I’m not on real drugs, or even drinking. I really knew better - how low-down, extremely dangerous, and just plain wrong this is, but something in me snapped and I wanted to get fucked up. 

My son and husband were home with me last Thursday night. I was hiding it in the bathroom and using it there. The hallucinations were terrifying and not even fun; yet I continued. I had delusions that people were here to hurt me/my family, and I didn’t stop. My hearing/vision were indicating to me that I was probably close to death. The very real threat of death or permanent brain damage did not stop me. 

I passed out and fell. My son heard the thud and found me. They told me he screamed in terror and my husband came, and I woke up yelling out for my son. This is one of the worst things I’ve ever done, letting them see that, my boy especially. My husband then called my parents and told them, and they came over to see me.

I’ve traumatized and hurt my family so much. Without their support and love, I’d already be long dead. I’m so very fortunate to have them, and I didn’t mean to hurt them, but I really did. I don’t remember much of the evening, but I was told it seemed I was trying to kill myself. 

I feel almost flat. Deep down, I’m so very ashamed and sorry and have nothing but love and the desire to be better, mixed with all the pain. On the surface, I maybe can’t bear those emotions and just push them down, so instead of a raving mess, I just feel manageably terrible. I don’t even feel “lucky to be alive” but I really fucking am. I’m alive, my family is safe, no one’s in jail or locked up in psych; I don’t feel like I even deserve that. I’ll look back and say I was given another chance, but right now I just really hate myself.

I want to fix this RIGHT NOW, but I know I can’t. I have to live my best life and get my shit together so I don’t ruin anyone else’s life any further than I have. People love me and depend on me; how beautiful is that? This will take a lot of time for my family to heal from and I just need to accept that. 

I needed to get this off my chest until I can get to a meeting; I don’t feel like I have anyone but other addicts that I can talk to, that understand, so thank you for taking the time to read this.

addiction,StewartDawson,2019/01/07,"I have a strange addiction to blankets. Please take me seriously. I own over 300 blankets. I started buying them a long time ago because they are so cheap and it made me feel like I was financially successful. I lie underneath all of them and sweat under the intense heat and pressure. I think it’s a form of self pain in order to deal with stress. I keep buying more because, why not? I know it sounds strange but I’m wired to keep doing it. I’ve wasted too much money at this point. I need real advice. Being addicted to something do stupid is really frustrating.

addiction,antiheropajamas,2019/01/08,"Uninteresting title, won't lie Today's my first day back on suboxone. 12mg. Possibly went on the worst heroin run but only lasted 8-10 days.
My stomach still hurts and I'm breathing heavily, shaking... Headache...
I also went off welbutrin cold turkey and also had an ectopic pregnancy... I'm in a support place but since it's abstinence based and since I generally don't talk to people I've just avoided staff.
I love in the skidrow so it's easy to find a nurse... Necessary? Do I need to increase suboxone? Dose was 3 hours ago...
I'm worried detox might get me into trouble at my housing.
Lived in extreme isolation and trauma and it's getting much more difficult psychologically to connect with the world.

addiction,zonegeek,2019/01/08,"How do other countries take care of there addicts? Hello M29 here from Sweden.

 I happen to be an addict, been to multiple rehabs.  In our country we have social workers that takes care of us and sends us to rehabs. We also have something called LVM (Law of care for addicts) wich basically is a lockdown for 6 months in order to save our lives. I have been to one of those aswell. (Only occur if you are a danger to yourself or anyone around you) 

I haven't payed one single penny for all the help I've got.  And I am so grateful for this country when it comes to addiction. 

Tell me, People of reddit.

addiction,VoidedPixel,2019/01/08,"Love and Codependency addiction I'm not sure if this is the correct forum for this so please point me into the right direction if i'm in the wrong place.  


I have often dismissed this issue as unrealistic and dumb but I have been struggling with Codependency since I was a teenager(I''m 23 ATM). I have always fantasized about having a girlfriend since I was 11 years old and always felt like I needed someone to be in my life in order for my life to feel complete. When I'm with someone, I go through life very fearless and I put a lot of effort into accomplishing things that I set out to accomplish, The only fear I have at this time is the fear of losing them. I have had a stream of toxic relationships over the years and settled for almost anyone in order to fill a void in my heart. I cant seem to function in life without dating someone and when my relationships end, I tend to fall into a deeper state of depression, become very suicidal, unmotivated, and lose more of my already low self esteem. When I experienced my first breakup of my longest relationship, I got heavily into partying and drinking which worsened my problem and lead to some other bad life choices.   


Growing up I never had any negative experiences with love in the family when I was younger so I don't quite understand why I'm so inclined to find someone to fill the emptiness in my heart but I was bullied a lot and given a significant amount of crap about my masculinity. This has been affecting a lot of areas of my life such as work, hobbies, sleep and other important areas of life. I left a job interview in tears today because it heavily reminded me of someone I dated almost 5 months ago and I'm still not over them. I can't drive down certain roads or go to certain places that I have been with a date or a partner because the reminders of them become almost paralyzing to me. It sucks that I have to stop doing what I love because its been tainted by the memories of a past lover and with the last person I was with, Its affected even my biggest passions when we stopped seeing each other so now I feel like I have nothing fulfilling in my life.   


I have worked with a couple of therapists on this issue and done a lot of work to improve my self-esteem, read self help books, go to workshops on healthy relationships, taken medication etc. but still I cant seem to get through life without this being a dominating issue. I see very good psychologist who suggested I stopped dating which I have made an oath to do but I find that i'm still actively looking for someone to replace the memories of my ex's which creates this revolving door in my life. Ill find someone else, clear the memories, and then ill have more memories to clear when it ends with that someone. I really want to get help with this and I want to learn to love myself more but I don't know where to go or where to find the right resources for this so with almost losing all hope, I have decided to write in this subreddit about an issue i'm heavily embarrassed by to see if I can at least get some pointers.",7.489161615068197,6.761730082214768,7.885581294652521,72.77013531067334,63.61409395973154,10.911799090712275,36.17211517644512,10.237710317436264,3.615947456159344,2443,101,452,48,31,807,261,596,0.152,0.698,0.15,0.0534,1,0,1,0,0,0,36.0,1,0,3,12,23,29,3,4,32,0,38,25,4,4,8,93,77,41,1,8,15,1,3,2,3,0,14,0,1,4,30,33,1,3,13,3,1,11,11,15,0,1,17,8,63,14,92,58,14,84,0,5,4,6,25,38,3,20,33,321,93,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0592065196591692,0.0,0.0,0.0481430286082157,0.0,0.2175366960331449,0.0,0.059933046107711614,0.0,0.09038146218236892,0.0,0.0,0.03693303864683432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03797520166563957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045347043470105784,0.09932162763732502,0.11996347836020865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05694358185605119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06009359424698092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04677759999375503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0555785522692318,0.0,0.053203666011454084,0.0,0.0,0.045369498322106114,0.0,0.09620606003311867,0.0,0.06057062329985755,0.035871608253808286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05312614252652097,0.05119915615602354,0.1222289434385367,0.054922095217757434,0.03879947014462505,0.052146648220713236,0.0,0.1985554472687902,0.046196528910689566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512506757514525,0.0,0.12346375615915195,0.045553115379305724,0.043437110854651365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12871653436213892,0.07280643814811179,0.0,0.0,0.05394263388547193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267444293715445,0.05389484391571198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02984765976180996,0.04427034968999484,0.0,0.0,0.059008575094319414,0.0,0.3836114996483788,0.053066786041723116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04560718632766062,0.1822788511956402,0.0,0.18469156108061624,0.1960695791928224,0.051389958727024114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054712168711390285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04335016550830058,0.0,0.0,0.040270587121353056,0.04188764686093208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05211244067568061,0.0,0.05698978969246275,0.0,0.0,0.04130562312824601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051845568512552564,0.0,0.047421880304616484,0.11348593761782765,0.0596166783939124,0.05134102761099985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051967864728214255,0.0,0.05459710676356736,0.0,0.057765958675540185,0.054325250528520386,0.0,0.03479273115893649,0.0,0.0,0.23323683644032456,0.0,0.09276183157743967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12983543815852447,0.09888457596428528,0.16997325541757996,0.0,0.0,0.08985250187459658,0.0,0.05434977575356327,0.0,0.3681372446790453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301174341150005,0.1362181633270542,0.0,0.05677718241696857,0.0,0.05940693037419498,0.0,0.05118705376649496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06305873839176669,0.03608151836323719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03166892039565377,0.0,0.051480054182443856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05653920137219338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13443568305447776,0.06406754297384612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04900682690644941,0.0,0.0,0.10470687065057847,0.0,0.118616188960811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05938006424354138,0.0,0.06994843139519176
addiction,whitemikeEZ,2019/01/08,I took my first big step today I had intake for an IOP program and have my first group meeting tomorrow morning.

addiction,IrvyMalone,2019/01/08,"Fog in my head I've been taking drugs regularly since I'm 19 yo and now I approach my 26th birthday. Never hard drugs.

March 2018 was when I realized how poorly I've handled my life so far, and so I stopped. 
Blank, without anything to compensate for, except the will to get my shit together, finally.
And so I got a job, then went back to studying and found a girlfriend along the way.
But of course, life has its way of f*ing you up when you least except it so I gradually lost everything I worked for. Even the gal, can you believe that shit? 
And how did I react? By keeping my cool and trust in my abilities to make the wheel of life turn my way again?
Nope, I went back to old habits, which is why I'm here.

I have nothing to smoke since 2 days, it's nerve wrecking and I have trouble thinking straight. It's strange  because I know how it's like to stop, but now is different because of harsher physical and mental pain than last time.

All the things I should do. I can't... it's too much and I have trouble trusting my own self now. I cry for no reason and I really would love a hug.

Stopping is not impossible, but my goodness if you have no backup plans in case things go south, I don't know about you but me, I dig my hole deeper so I don't have to face more challenges. 
Anxieties and past depressions do not make for a solid and confident idea of how and where to start, for sure. I need a clean and clear view of my destination but it's a fog in my head.

PM if you feel like sharing something, I would love to hear from you, and the way you kept your focus strong.",2.0976637362637334,3.776469640000002,3.314631868131869,91.97190384615385,77.21538461538461,6.612087912087913,24.222527472527474,7.447530270364453,0.8976835164835171,1223,41,274,16,28,396,178,325,0.127,0.6990000000000001,0.175,0.9682,2,0,4,0,0,0,40.0,0,9,0,5,22,20,2,0,12,1,22,14,5,8,4,56,46,34,0,6,12,0,2,2,1,4,6,1,1,1,11,16,0,5,8,0,1,4,10,7,0,0,9,5,43,13,34,33,5,38,0,2,1,3,15,9,2,2,23,177,54,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801603062486558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08622919994980922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16114653083275987,0.0,0.12775203530579393,0.0,0.0,0.1180569125500293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11510149989909405,0.0675777137281587,0.0,0.09025124358227007,0.0,0.0,0.10947811559887903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2430348722702907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06920956300952666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417408138000376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05298248942023752,0.07485848849348962,0.0,0.11478694310623187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11489144153678693,0.0,0.0,0.05474588413904158,0.0,0.0595517808320073,0.08788876112878465,0.08380620794518262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09386685782343744,0.0,0.21507946355352509,0.0,0.11810041081160555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11828961095637153,0.0,0.0,0.1039830321930736,0.0931378016559098,0.0,0.0,0.11517428905644847,0.08541383298581813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22203842159718212,0.10238540313780864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11438530271029472,0.0,0.1891452677474584,0.0,0.13988972110708273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10559872396054867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702909711597651,0.07769681574034318,0.08081672040546735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054411893118384,0.0,0.10995432411931057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149872255661344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000292240968398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06712801116638792,0.10773652338771668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10931370056901453,0.0,0.21512077604031368,0.17335861682179535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08066868082135252,0.0,0.0,0.07416742529516439,0.0,0.0,0.26281507902074264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09875870626871487,0.0,0.07878534623629166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13922911406542496,0.06714205397218123,0.0,0.0,0.06110102803472695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11397608699792128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326941051032876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942736545344697,0.09455224451272808,0.0,0.0,0.10100908649742828,0.0,0.0762847927507462,0.0,0.0,0.14887264153900945,0.0,0.0,0.0

I just love the way to makes me feel i can imagine something and it comes true. I got a girlfriend almost 3 months ago and had been off inhalants for 5 months. Yesterday i had half a can of dustoff on the counter and thought one last time can't hurt.

addiction,anxietycheesecake,2019/01/08,"My best friend is suffering but isn't ready for help, I don't know how to help him My best friend has been suffering for about 6 months now with an addiction to adderall. He was casual about it up until a month ago when he told me it was serious, but he wasn't ready to talk about it. He finally opened up to me a few nights ago.

He said it's pretty bad, and he knows he needs help, but he doesn't ""want"" to stop yet. He said he's feeling pretty close to telling his parents, but has pulled back in fear of everyone thinking he's a ""drug addict"", he said that's the worst possible thing to happen. He also does't want anything on his 'record'. He said he's not willing to go to rehab or a treatment center of any kind.

He's very self aware though. I told him he can't be taking 15 pills in one shot and he would correct me and say ""no it's over a 48 hour period, look at me justifying it, as if that makes a difference I know its still terrible"". 

As of today, he hasn't taken anything for like 3 days because he can't afford to. He's 21, has no income, he just gets by on asking his dad for money for food, and then spends it on pills. His body used to be so healthy and now his body is wasting away, he's a skinny stick, none of his clothes fit. 

He's very agitated and said anything will tick him off at any moment, so he's reluctant to hang out with me. And im scared too, I dont want to say the wrong thing or piss him off because he's pushed almost everyone away at this point, i'm his last hope :(

What can I do?

addiction,robsterLA,2019/01/09,"AA Harms Us All.  

AA begins and ends with shame and condemnation. We are told that this organization is the premiere way for people suffering from substance addiction to receive help. Nothing is further from the truth. While some recent articles have finally questioned the actual results of the organization, I want to go one step farther by acknowledging how, far from being a benign failure, AA is actually dangerous and harmful to overwhelming majority of addicts and non-addicts alike. This is because AA has almost singularly defined what it means to be a substance user. In short, AA invented the Addict. And they still control the very definition of that dirty word. The articles that have come out recently, that are critical of AA, have mainly focused on the ineffective success rate of the AA program. Most authors site - at most - a 5% to 7% success rate for AA participants. This number is shockingly low and researchers from our best institutions have noted that the ""AA success rate"" is actually far lower than the rate of those people who just decide to quit on their own - so-called spontaneous remission.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you may ask, what about the people who do claim that AA has saved their lives, isn't the program helping them stay sober? And, almost every author, who is critical of AA's abysmal success rate, eventually cedes the point that AA does, in fact, help ""some"" people? They do? They help ""some"" people? Really? Who are these lucky ones?While it is true that some people, usually the proverbial old-timers, seem to stay sober (mostly) from AA, they do not do so in spite of all the other people failed by the program. Rather, they stay sober by exploiting and demonizing the very people whom they and the program have failed.

&amp;#x200B;

After attending countless AA meetings, I believe that old-timers, even those who diligently work their programs, actually survive by wielding power over and exploiting other substance abusers, controlling new members, and ultimately by demonizing those people who choose use drugs and alcohol - usually by turning other users into scapegoats and pariahs. Their rigid definition of the drug user - The Addict - serves not to help the user, but rather to create a boogieman or enemy out there. And this is how the old tiers stay sober: they construct an external enemy and they try to stay sober by rallying, one day at a time, against that enemy. Their boogieman - The Addict - assumes a contradictory, tripartite identity: one part blameless victim, one part perpetually diseased person, and one part morally flawed, condemned soul. But users and people with substance issues are not boogie-men, they are not our enemies, Rather, they are our loved ones, people in our families, our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends, and sometime our selves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overreacting? No. Most people who have attended more than a couple of meetings and then decided at AA wasn't for them are left with a couple of inescapable observations.  The first is how AA always tends to facilitate an ""us versus them"" mentality in their members. People who believe in AA, especially those pesky old-timers, believe that they have found the one and only route to true sobriety and salvation - irrespective of any actual medical or psychological research. No other methods of recovery or harm reduction are ever acknowledged as valid within the program or at a meeting. Far from it, those brave enough to mention alternatives are quickly given the cold shoulder by more established members. The message is always the same: without AA your disease will progress and you will die. Even those folks who achieve abstinence apart from AA are still derided as ""dry drunks"" and as being in ""denial"" and simply bidding their time till relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

And, why do adherents to the program cultivate such as an ""us versus them,"" you're in or you're out, with us or against us, you're among the chosen people or you're among the condemned people kind of attitude? One reason: Control. Most of these old-timers achieve sobriety, and the appearance of control in other areas of their life, mainly by exerting interpersonal control over others - usually the most vulnerable and/or newcomers to their AA meeting.

But you may ask, isn't their need for control - to give unchallenged directions - benign or even beneficial if it helps other addicts stay sober? After all, aren't these sorry people just in need of some Good Orderly Direction (another one of their crazy acronyms for god)? But the fact is that power and control are never just neutral, never simply benign. And covering up the need for power and control with talk of spirituality and a higher power makes it only more dangerous - especially for the vulnerable newcomer.

&amp;#x200B;

AA seeks to control its members in numerous ways. You're forced to ""share"" to the group, revealing your inmost conflicts and foibles for others to judge. This is one of the first steps of many into lifelong shame and condemnation.

&amp;#x200B;

You are told to get a sponsor. This sponsor chimes in on almost every aspect of your life, even those areas that have seemingly nothing to do with your substance use. Sponsors receive no special training or qualifications and are usually ill-equipped to advise people on their most pressing problems. These relationships always involve the sponsor exerting their power over the newcomer in countless ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Newcomers are told how many meeting they need to attend (often 90 meetings in 90 days), what book to read (always read the Big Book) and how to think (think like the Home Group). However, the advice of the sponsor almost never stops there. Newcomers are advised on who to associate with, and who not to associate with. They are frequently given career advice, and are given directions on how to deal with spouses, families, and loved ones. Unsurprisingly, much of this advice is hogwash! And frequently, the demands of a sponsor lead to frayed social relationships with non-AA members and isolation outside of the AA organization.There has not yet been a formal study as to how many people get divorced as a result of following the directions of their AA group or sponsor, but the anecdotal evidence suggests a staggeringly large number. Newcomers are often encouraged to drop their relationships with non-AA members and are encouraged to only have romantic connections with those in the program.

&amp;#x200B;

But the need of AAers to perpetuate their beliefs harms far more than just the unwitting newcomer. AA has ingrained in our collective consciousness the very idea of what it means to be a substance user: The Addict - and this is where their harm is most insidious and pervasive. Without any medical backup, they contend that someone with a substance problem is once and forever an addict. This idea is found in the very preface of their organization's holy text, the Big Book, under the disingenuous title ""The Doctor's Opinion."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with this idea is that it leads people into accepting the idea that they are terminally ill or at least terminally deficient and powerless - but this simply is not usually the case. The truth is that for most people substance abuse is not a lifelong condition that needs to be managed with constant meetings and sponsorship. Their rigid disease model actually serves to keep people away from other helpful alternatives, such as behavioral therapy, membership in positive social groups, or harm reduction. 

They also perpetuate the idea that the addict is a person of uniquely flawed character - one of the condemned who needs AA's saving. At its face this is contradictory: is the addict somebody who has a disease or is the addict somebody who has deeply-seated character flaws? And it is this contradiction is at the heart of AA's religiosity and thinly-veiled religious ideology.

&amp;#x200B;

AA has its roots in the Oxford Group, a radical christian cult from the early twentieth century. In fact, the 12 Steps themselves are almost directly taken from the Oxford Group's cult methodology. Central to the Oxford Group's ideology is the old-line protestant idea of Total Depravity - the idea that all human beings are inexorably into sin, brokenness, moral failure, and rebellion. This radical and detrimental belief is the underpinning of virtually all AA thought: e.g. the addict is hopeless and powerless and needs the intervention of a higher power to get right.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctrine of Total Depravity is much more than just a dusty old theological formulation. It has real consequences for those belonging to a group operating on such a notions - and what a shame it is! I believe that telling people over and over again that they are powerless and morally flawed only leads to greater and greater problems and dysfunctions with one's self-image and ultimately one's behavior in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let me conclude with my original point: AA is not a harmless organization. It's an organization run by power-seeking individuals who often mess up the lives of those whom they purport to help. Their most harmful invention is the identity of the modern addict - a caste or class of person they claim to be inexorably diseased as well as morally flawed. And this classification of the addict is not just limited to AA meetings and their written propaganda. That would be bad enough! Rather, their model of the addict has been perpetuated for almost a hundred years by television, media, the courts, the prison industry, religious authorities, celebrities, and by a multi-billion dollar recovery industry. In fact, over 95% of private recovery programs are still based on the 12 Steps and their assumptions about the drug user - virtually without any empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

The damage is not limited to the people who weave in and out of their meeting rooms - that would be bad enough. The deepest harm from AA stems from their need to demonize and scapegoat the substance user - to cast the unrepentant user as inevitably among the condemned!  But we are not condemned. Their organization only thrives so long as they are able to label non-adherents as depraved addicts who are, at best, in ""denial"" or ""dry-drunks.""  So long as AA propaganda dominates are collective conscious, we are doing all doing a disservice for people who struggle with substance issues.

&amp;#x200B;

AA can only thrive so long as they cast the unrepentant user as outsider, condemned to a long and painful road to death. But that is not the truth. Drug users are not all suffering from ""character flaws."" Drug use does not make you condemned for life and most users do learn to quit or moderate without AA and then go on to live happy, normal lifespans. We need to cut through the fear and labeling that AA and the 12-Step industry thrives on. What we need is a new model for understanding the substance user, not as somebody who is inherently flawed and diseased, not as somebody who is morally disordered, but as someone who could benefit from harm reduction, psychological therapy, and real medical treatment - as full human beings!",10.72901120195082,10.642686995776137,9.806044154628294,59.535664387811785,56.81414994720169,12.815589109395926,43.23221458975169,12.058725423621393,5.682718782046398,9006,449,1276,237,97,2854,624,1894,0.138,0.7859999999999999,0.076,-0.9993,15,1,8,0,3,1,327.0,19,9,51,40,47,75,6,8,139,0,124,37,3,31,22,309,176,133,2,25,60,1,1,1,2,6,31,0,3,5,108,102,2,16,34,6,1,18,31,41,37,16,14,2,85,34,257,144,49,164,14,8,0,2,164,87,0,51,49,945,193,35,0.020300375813577298,0.048105251594141085,0.11886143057781008,0.3762169034417914,0.0,0.05951187689192185,0.0,0.02169492800620243,0.1219673639645212,0.0,0.0,0.016234203203793998,0.06756615562438559,0.3079362819764501,0.3453405004049867,0.04141485504834388,0.021286714062909787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037956222072791465,0.0,0.019072871324363836,0.0,0.03389993171414567,0.012374920674680635,0.0,0.0,0.09148628744159433,0.042607983965380784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017486976245278625,0.0,0.021937494413845588,0.2049173788582723,0.016208198230527486,0.04492395943680864,0.0,0.02618412598313612,0.02092879607728749,0.0,0.0,0.02106858507848904,0.0,0.023265989424440282,0.0207782948457727,0.03552999135256001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770995500490425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017980107500060766,0.06292714454381287,0.0,0.05363282706985478,0.01836285214182955,0.03420788434193673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03827477525972059,0.022843566630700685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022238069429243383,0.0,0.03453497859315412,0.0,0.04451662853947391,0.015684019996310326,0.0,0.03181832548644354,0.019473970270670538,0.023074342794400373,0.017026992087621762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02161012753750743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02405604308158778,0.10885531195427248,0.0,0.020362932132489492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604165732630452,0.0,0.042376636292317214,0.0,0.018043906769033682,0.0,0.02113971750384553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02205641771954972,0.02075850966192416,0.04301626737169968,0.009917738210923965,0.0,0.05377681129054412,0.07186077511777424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036643763502684036,0.0,0.027101316981128904,0.06174418441497636,0.0,0.044226121040166266,0.0,0.06135147877297616,0.02045800412073781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029846224028314907,0.16557718584703596,0.04697070391770791,0.03921245892080292,0.0,0.0,0.01989005811940587,0.038957516194581564,0.0,0.14911280667902074,0.021619237708865747,0.19258484040789625,0.0926361034571661,0.02160103114856188,0.0,0.0,0.06594998624676805,0.0,0.33776938880265683,0.0531765154152553,0.0,0.0,0.0383808336103395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07769887211181899,0.0,0.0,0.02274106687046606,0.0431838970007807,0.04061173876715366,0.046212543987429126,0.013004940567008743,0.020872167359174798,0.040088344120642806,0.06538501926064973,0.0,0.017336410025426026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03696139942377264,0.021177719321016485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04138735331066781,0.034400885099269134,0.0,0.020077590758893427,0.022724608707052663,0.0,0.12982499739794714,0.048635719043361884,0.016972023170807416,0.0,0.021222360484489784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01631667311438463,0.017743423236350083,0.0,0.0464304978762415,0.0,0.0,0.02601532225618281,0.0,0.016116230821997632,0.023674624776389496,0.0,0.0,0.0581936371300996,0.0,0.013782622625753232,0.022080979485511288,0.0,0.021133407153139102,0.12209426292192888,0.05259902040232964,0.11178997971581538,0.06699974429418144,0.011973687619448958,0.048340480248305576,0.0,0.0,0.03650495166706366,0.0,0.01831793165028269,0.0,0.0,0.07827535145475305,0.0,0.014778915368593312,0.0,0.0,0.02884160906345817,0.0,0.3453405004049867,0.013072776449978516
addiction,BardiB204,2019/01/09,"I need words of advice desperately. I am a mother of four. I have a loving husband. We own our home and have  careers and make good money.  I have it all. Everything I dreamed of!  So I don't know why I've let myself get this way.

Long story short, I've become addicted to pain killers. I always had it under control. Used them from time to time. Never during any of my pregnancies. My use increased after my last baby due to post partum depression. Now I'm using the max dose my body can handle until I cross the threshold of toxicity and going into liver failure. I feel it inside myself. That I'm slowly killing myself. I'm really scared that I've already made irreversible damage to my liver and will die early. I just tell myself my liver will repair itself whether it is true or not (to ease my mind). 

 I want to quit but the addiction has consumed me! I don't have time to go to addictions meetings. I've read a bit about NA but as soon I read about god I stopped reading (I'm athiest). I really needs some advice about how to overcome the urge to use. The urge is the hardest part. When i get stressed it's instant that i want to use pills. The urge consumes me and causes me mood swings. 

What do you Do when the urge to use hits you? I need something to replace my addiction or distract me from it. If I get stressed out I instantly have the urge and fixate on using.  

I'm fairly certain I can kick this on my own but the hardest part is the urge! I need something to replace this addiction. I'm slowly killing myself I need help.",1.486044041703206,3.7850502186495234,3.3381876644256074,87.9150531033811,82.18327974276528,5.5703400565136905,22.929065575367822,6.850034144686104,0.8314407288317254,1202,42,237,14,33,402,160,311,0.135,0.802,0.063,-0.9699,0,0,2,0,0,2,35.0,2,2,1,2,10,14,2,4,14,0,20,13,4,12,4,47,51,19,3,8,9,2,1,0,0,2,8,0,1,0,14,9,0,2,2,4,1,4,4,9,0,1,2,1,46,4,32,45,8,27,0,2,0,1,11,6,0,4,15,155,60,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44971113208015656,0.0,0.16124514195064507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09104591240717226,0.0,0.06865046267045402,0.0,0.0,0.056105978586957185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09111988337130338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09007368902572883,0.0916440461976191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08475498344069989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09253595967676316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07106111816834831,0.0,0.08562678163847354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07414984281340993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04171682064538774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12931579403076696,0.0,0.09377856674033007,0.06920097045033106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05530111533458559,0.0,0.082758872355788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18255830123151628,0.0,0.045342387759649785,0.06725228637413662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436657551230288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301400255947317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07446365107497803,0.07806787715178065,0.05507248214849283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08330615833281466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3058806940203514,0.06363265801956752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08779074486649968,0.0,0.0,0.1786889516745637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07901663053769624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08775383123756897,0.24758087510994745,0.0,0.10570915911097772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260152912576084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12703219219589876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689775662008558,0.18901755313236587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07211268442175453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14432734224073115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4988025809242158,0.0,0.0,0.097326738495092,0.06548833616654458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07444759710459528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Not your average addict but when in social situations, a lot of people in my group tend to get cocaine hungry after a few beers, my issue is I always join them.

addiction,overunderachiever_,2019/01/10,"Advice needed I decided to stop smoking because I got a sperm analysis that showed my boys had poor motility (they swim, just not very well) and assumed weed was the problem. Although it could be several other factors, I thought starting with quitting smoking would help alot. 

I'm on day 5 with no weed. I smoked weed for the past 20 years and pretty much everyday for the past 5-6 years. I never thought it was a problem because always thought I could stop whenever I wanted to and I didn't see it negatively affecting my life. I never smoked at work and only smoke at home and social gatherings, for the most part. 

Since I've stopped, my appetite is non-existent and I haven't had a full night's sleep.  It's only been 5 days and I'm already thinking about just taking a little bit before bed. I'm realizing now that I may be addicted, even though I never believed you could be addicted to weed. 

Am I addicted to weed?",5.107799263351751,5.951924563535918,6.004102209944751,78.88121777163906,68.55801104972376,9.127255985267038,33.31537753222836,9.2995712137729,3.0332316758747697,730,33,137,14,12,241,109,181,0.102,0.862,0.036000000000000004,-0.8442,1,0,3,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,1,2,7,3,0,0,9,0,17,5,1,1,3,37,30,9,0,8,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,2,1,7,9,0,3,7,2,1,1,8,2,1,0,10,1,18,1,13,12,6,22,0,0,1,0,6,5,0,4,16,88,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3814078696733168,0.0,0.1139623521624049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869604885050773,0.0,0.09703942839229228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14218423026424942,0.0,0.0992373275644938,0.13139384588370967,0.0,0.0,0.12732178278535716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2793412075068587,0.0,0.0,0.15042398638043886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0770281930920307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09327382643672837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07816973714051915,0.0,0.11698207638231542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08237406156469647,0.0,0.11688658273162612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08573110287573255,0.08647425392151765,0.2698398461322508,0.0,0.0,0.10944250319575774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17739363630407615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262910187055475,0.22265912551757586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11864721195819715,0.0,0.22318434626863676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12404259623718948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09293319227006856,0.0,0.0,0.13175045504718086,0.0,0.0964715021309881,0.0,0.116706922969075,0.11888215544669956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825461469246424,0.0,0.0,0.2925053962776859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08768575611257963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747271167895226,0.11458121008410525,0.2777561894447265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622594076361196,0.06878708972572299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10485781262894896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490271416944481,0.0,0.0,0.08284541962076114,0.0,0.0,0.15020238964115804

addiction,andanotherone9,2019/01/10,"Is there really such a thing as an 'addictive personality'? I feel like it's a real thing because I get addicted to so many things and so quickly. I am recovering from drugs and alcohol, but every time I feel like I've beaten an addiction, I seem to create a different one. I quit drugs so I started drinking. I stopped drinking and started smoking. I stopped smoking and started selfharming. I stopped selfharming and I started seeking out fights. And so on. 

I'm always getting out of hand in one way or another. It's like my mind craves destruction, like it doesn't want to heal or be normal. I try so hard to be the best I can, but I'm always fucking it up. 

So can you really have an addictive personality, making everything a risk of becoming the next addiction? I really don't want to get addicted to anything but it still happens. Even to innocent things like sleeping or gaming or eating one kind of food. I get aggressive and angry if I can't have the thing I want at that time. I don't want to be like this but I don't know how to quit getting addicted to everything.

addiction,Contivity,2019/01/10,"Addiction or Lack of Discipline? My drugs of choice are nicotine, alcohol and weed. For nicotine I'm definitely addicted, but for the other two I'm not sure. They sure are addictive, but when the risk is large enough or it's inconvenient to have some, I can easily not take them.

For example, at work I can easily stay away from intoxication. When I know that I will need to drive, then I stay away from them. When I travel to a more restrictive country, I'm fine not taking any mind altering substance for the whole month, unless it's easy to score something (with minimal risk/effort).

However, when I have alcohol and weed at home, and I know that I will do nothing for extended period of time, I always get the itch to be intoxicated. I don't really drink for fun or enjoy mild high. Either I go wasted or I don't do it at all.

Is this addiction or lack of discipline?",5.210271132376394,5.8497097719298266,6.758107389686337,74.29846889952155,68.23976608187135,11.364380648591174,29.58054226475279,11.20814326018867,3.4715684210526323,685,24,134,22,11,236,98,171,0.11,0.758,0.133,0.7244,1,0,5,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,3,1,4,6,0,1,5,0,15,11,1,0,3,29,25,16,0,3,12,0,0,0,0,2,10,0,1,0,7,4,3,3,2,2,0,3,5,1,0,1,0,0,17,5,24,22,8,19,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,6,8,95,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5982554190171603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29324152921454305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141580349608568,0.0,0.0,0.09329796210972256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257800254145562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13439981646515411,0.15910376471194038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417601085520752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07167923012561016,0.0,0.07797162964445058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14495507156071302,0.13761874102822633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15079863079502806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13852881634700326,0.0,0.10950851181562063,0.0,0.0,0.10172907101718584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13164323039045567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08789124946908355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10562015807138174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2924652923205839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2586111502214084,0.0,0.20630858564834892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000007157230696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13402052426100275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15317439744013928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09988029786454268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,mahtabalam93,2019/01/10,"The Psychology Behind Addiction: Symptoms, Causes, and Complications of Addiction  Addiction is a chronic disease with psychological, biological, environmental and social factors influencing its maintenance and development. Almost half the risk for addiction is genetic. Genes generally affect the degree of awards that people experience when they initially use a substance or engage in some behaviors, as well as the body processes alcohol or other medicines. 

 In the case of addiction to drugs, alcohol, and nicotine, these substances affect the way one feels physiologically and mentally. These feelings are usually pleasant, creating a strong incentive to use them again.

 The complications of addiction are generally dependent on the type of behavior or substance abuse. For example, sex addiction greatly increases the risk of sexual behavior, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Injecting intravenous (IV) drugs with non-sterilized needles can cause the transmission of HIV, hepatitis C, and other harmful infections. It is often not a type of complexity that disrupts the daily life of the addictive personality. These factors often support each other and work together to create health risks.

addiction,rk705,2019/01/10,"Finding it really difficult in me to quit, I feel like I have no moral compass. (longish read) Hi all, 

I need some advise on how to overcome addiction. I'll be honest, I've known i've had a problem with addiction my entire life. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started at 10 with MMORPGs and video games, throughout my entire childhood from around 10-18, I would use gaming as a crutch, a way to hide from reality. I'd spend all my possible free time playing games like Runescape and call of duty. I neglected my social life and academic life totally and really had an uneventful time growing up. I started smoking weed recreationally at around 15, maybe once every few months. Again, I really had no remorse or feeling of regret back then, I didn't care that I was failing school or affecting my personal relationships, I just lived in the moment and cared about my own daily personal satisfaction from playing these games and getting high. My weed use became daily during college (the freedom of being away from home) and i'd probably say i've smoked weed consistently every day from when I was 19 until now (24). I fully realised I had a problem with weed from around 21, all my friends knew it, I knew it.. but it was always just like - it's only weed. I spent my early 20s just getting high from morning until evening. I again neglected my studies and would follow the same routine of promising myself i'd quit for a couple months before exams and study intensely. That would never happen, i'd still smoke days before exams, i'd fall into really negative and depressing states knowing what a mess I was in, Doctors were also really supportive and would give me medical notes to defer my exams. During this time, I also would drink socially and smoke cigs but I never really considered that an issue, i'd go out maybe once or twice a week and would only drink then, weed was always my poison. At around 21, I also started getting into MDMA and that scene of partying, again it was nothing out of control, I always had a bad comedown and again it wasn't really something I wanted to do every week, I still do MDMA but its maybe 2-3 times a year if that. 

&amp;#x200B;

A part of my college degree its required for me to spend a year working in industry related to my undergrad between my 3rd and final years. I got a placement at a finance company through the assistance of a family member and this was the first time I was on a salary and earning decent money considering I was living at home with no bills or rent to pay. Shortly after I started work, I got introduced to the wonderful drug that is cocaine. I did Coke for the first with my closest friends all of whom are qualified professionals working in law, finance etc. I find it interesting how addiction develops, the four of us have been best friends since we were all 10, we've grown up watching each other develop and our first time doing things like smoking, drugs, alcohol have all been together. So we all did coke and we all loved it, said it was the best drug we've tried and just yeah loved it. two of them had a very much cool, it was fun now back to reality mentality and didn't think too much of it. I was hooked from the beginning and so was another friend. What started as lets go to a bar and share half a gram every few months turned into me and my friend splitting a gram and just staying at home playing games and drinking. It eventually turned into me picking up a gram alone and rationing it throughout the week before, during and after work. I've always justified it to myself as having it under control, I can still work effectively and I also preferred it to weed. I didnt have to sneak around at home due to the smell of weed, I didnt get the munchies, I was losing weight etc. I saw nothing wrong with my use, this carried on for about 6 months where I was honestly embracing my coke use. I'd snapchat my friends pictures of my product like I was showing it off, i'd post on coke message board. All while my bank balance simply couldnt facilitate my use anymore, I was taking out loans and credit cards like no tomorrow to fund my use all while mantaining this image that was fine and in control of it. In actual fact, from that day, my life has been in shambles. For a solid 12 months i've smoked weed 5x a week after work, on a Friday/Saturday i'll without doubt be drinking and doing coke, and Sunday il get back on the weed.

&amp;#x200B;

This year has been the worst of my life, i havent been to a gym in over a year, i've gained over 30 lbs from weekly beer drinking and binging from weed. Ive accumulated so much debt, which thankfully my family has cleared for me and given me a fresh start for 2019. I've destroyed so many social connections and have honestly become such a greedy person since I started doing coke. I stopped buying gifts for my family for xmas, bdays to fund it. I havent spent any money on myself or my health over the past year due to my addiction. I've needed basic products like a face wash, moisturiser etc but I'd rather ration my money to buy drugs. I had a few nasty binges during Christmas that put me off cocaine and alcohol, i haven't used either since NYE but I know it's just a matter of time. i'm still smoking weed daily even though I have exams in a few weeks, I just find it impossible to say no. In one sense, I know i'm in the wrong and I need to stop but I also know how fucking hard it is and I always cave in. Always. It only takes one friend to say lets get some coke for me to be there. It only takes me to be home alone for 20 mins before i'm smoking. I just don't have the ability to say no, theres a time and a place. For example,  on Sunday, I had an assignment due in on a Monday which i hadn't started but it was completely doable. I don't have it in me to say ok i'm going to spend the whole day studying and once I submit it tonight, I can reward myself with a J.. my mind just doesn't work like that. or if I say, I can smoke a J only once I get a haircut, go gym etc etc. I'll wake up and just start waking and baking which just fucks up the rest of my day. I don't know if Moral compass is the right wording, it's like I know what i'm doing is completely wrong but I still do it. I constantly think about how im damaging my future career prospects, my ability to have a functioning life in the future but I still give in and do it and find some solace for a few hours and then im back feeling guilty again, how to solve that? just keep using. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I change this? ""my life right now is literally from tomorrow il change, from tomorrow.. oh it's friday now, let me just enjoy the weekend and il get it fresh from Monday"".

It's 9 pm right now and i've got an exam on Monday, I've done like 3 hours of work today and I already have it set in my mind that it's ok to take the rest of the evening off, go pick up from my dealer and smoke tonight cause i've earned it.. but the reality is, I haven't earned anything. The thing is, now that i've got it in my head, I'm not going to be able to focus on anything until I get what I want. Im typing this right now like i'll be able to resist the urge and carry on studying but I know for a fact i'll be smoking in an hour or so.

addiction,DopamineDarling,2019/01/10,"Harm Reduction or a Threat to My Recovery? I'll try to make this quick, but I tend to ramble.


So hi, I'm Tiffany I'm an addict, and honestly, it would be easier to list the substances I didn't abuse than the ones I did. I hid my addiction for about a decade before having a public nervous breakdown (that I turned into a website/blog because that's the kind of person I am) and admitting it all. I was admitted to an addiction IOP and during my early days there my therapist said it was ok for me to continue to smoke marijuana as long as I was using it as ""harm reduction"" because for some reason I have a high tolerance for everything but weed. Smoking pot makes me too stupid to figure out how to do other drugs it also reduced my cravings.

Eventually, my therapist told me no more cannabis, I should use the coping methods I had been working on for months in the IOP. I complied and then I relapsed with opioids and benzodiazepines. That fucked up my head so much that I sent myself to rehab. Now I'm trying to live a clean life with none of my ""cheat drugs"" only take medication as prescribed, and absolutely nothing that isn't approved by my doctor.

But I keep weed in my house. It's hidden in a far dark corner in a closet, but I know it's there. I keep telling myself that if I have an intense craving for something harder (i.e., heroin) maybe smoking a little weed will prevent me from using the harder stuff. But I'm on naltrexone and haven't had a true opioid craving in months, I do romanticize it and have had thoughts of relapse, but I haven't yet.

I struggle with other addictions and mental health issues, so I keep saying it's there ""just for harm reduction, so I don't do something that could hurt actually me"" but I don't know if having it around is a good idea. I was never big into weed, but I'm an addict and when I get into that mode, I'll abuse fucking anything. So I don't know if I'm setting myself up for relapse by keeping it in my house.


TL;DR: Is keeping weed in my house a good idea to use as harm reduction to prevent me from using more dangerous substances if I get a bad craving? Or is keeping a drug in my house a bad idea and setting me up for relapse because I'm one of those ""I'll abuse anything"" types of addicts, and I should find another emergency plan?",5.231818181818183,5.390899606060606,6.3740043290043324,78.7524350649351,68.0909090909091,9.024242424242424,32.08441558441558,8.841846274778883,2.593475324675325,1806,72,351,28,28,608,206,462,0.135,0.755,0.111,-0.9256,0,0,9,0,3,0,52.0,0,0,0,3,18,22,6,2,25,1,34,17,1,9,3,71,70,40,0,8,15,0,0,0,0,4,14,2,2,1,24,20,0,8,12,0,0,1,10,15,0,2,14,2,52,7,59,50,6,38,0,1,0,2,10,23,2,7,12,247,76,3,0.0,0.2417392708588338,0.06636714890539276,0.4448402661636836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05438691640252261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07131355470241457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193152020393997,0.06054258868019755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11356964854040898,0.12437329404582305,0.0,0.057870802777316724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0542997960006562,0.0,0.0,0.04386029462120854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961027717701017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23660717075785825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06112226542058216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062159158118449916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12574678141945048,0.07106397879324458,0.0,0.0,0.1140857464491363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979703897927451,0.07229057772524719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185543227314392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3138938489584521,0.07280523342461799,0.2303222571887365,0.0,0.07098391422474422,0.0,0.36269810228555016,0.0,0.07082109508065637,0.112128199641189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04803689486377002,0.0,0.06816306467120807,0.0600533516251156,0.060185983874426974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09079331104506902,0.0,0.06832436202283461,0.0,0.0,0.0685120935781887,0.0685372571668316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10856855671730463,0.0,0.04999457228610906,0.0,0.05245287198620674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06525664210084119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921695604571251,0.051724045741923484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05938299244217603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0699247636026637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469230380145384,0.05408362935369073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471357825929103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07109796095594023,0.07785423965625114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0511344392569735,0.0,0.059443020648184484,0.0,0.0,0.157927798783082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053991691950418565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06498568563385147,0.0,0.0923475374977658,0.07397445814178674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2936904765784385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049511492777409294,0.0,0.0,0.048311769951294825,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,decpage101,2019/01/10,"Bad habits with adderall Was diagnosed this year with ADHD and have been medicated with adderall.

During the semester it was fantastic as I could finally pay attention to the lectures/video/etc. 

Now it is summer holidays and since I have never really developed legit hobbies outside of work/uni/gym in my spare time I have started to take extra adderall to play video games. It's the only thing I really look forward to and am starting to worry that this is going to open the door to an addiction. I just get so bored when I am not being stimulated by something and it is so easy to just open up my computer. 

I don't feel like I am addicted to the adderall itself but wondering from people's history if this is a huge red flag? 

On any day I take 15-20mg but when I play video games I will take 25-35mg for a 5 hour session.",6.321131071190956,5.666362976047907,7.544870259481037,74.0190751829674,65.94610778443113,11.25455755156354,34.124417831004656,10.746095033038511,3.613896074517632,655,26,127,16,9,225,108,167,0.066,0.8420000000000001,0.092,0.7237,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,0,8,0,17,4,0,1,1,21,27,12,0,2,6,0,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,10,9,0,0,3,7,1,2,3,2,0,0,3,3,13,3,20,21,1,20,0,0,2,0,2,7,0,2,14,85,23,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.386798169497897,0.2132079321627755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206423872305608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14812687443334688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14164451800841307,0.0,0.0,0.11441240573450773,0.0,0.0,0.18006368954367968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978549520610373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08970197039747715,0.1267391168727909,0.0,0.19433996184783173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09268748471732356,0.0,0.10082410509139528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17470949826446444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08667177120119833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489766354198853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1787182123577878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13682669766482106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13492550742679266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229912109766924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2273020741901505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14675234860101216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13657605934002293,0.0,0.0,0.25113822551881554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4001624427150864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11786088201051287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1034470570937912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19238959613454307,0.12915392039867726,0.1801647385901968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11424385936996766

addiction,thatonecouch,2019/01/11,"Well That Was Unexpected So I just celebrated 6 months clean, a place I never thought I would get to. This post isn't about that, though. It's about my dad. 

When I finally told my parents about the issue I was sick with his reply - you chose to get yourself into that mess, you should have come to talk to us, you just fucked up your life, etc. Nothing supportive. His brother was really bad into dope, meth, opiates, benzodiazepines, and my dad had seen just how much havoc my uncle released on the family. That was a huge reason why I didn't feel I could talk to my parents about my own addiction - I was afraid he would hate me as much as he hated his brother. He supported me financially to go to inpatient treatment, but he refused to try and educate himself on the disease of addiction and the science behind it. When I got home it was the same stuff over and over; he would always pick fights and shame the shit out of me. He never wanted me to talk about what I was doing in treatment or about my past. 

This week I had a family workshop as part of my final three weeks of treatment. I wasn't surprised that he was going; I figured my mom had made him come. I had to read a letter to them explaining my feelings regarding my addiction, and in it I put that one of my biggest regrets was not feeling like I could come to them. I didn't realize that they had received a lot of education that morning. The next day we came back and my parents read a letter to me that explained it from their perspective. There was something in the language of that letter that indicated a shift was coming. We had dinner together that night, and I cautiously asked how they felt the workshop had gone. My dad, much to my surprise, said he really enjoyed it and that there were some things he wanted to talk with me about. 

We got home and my mom said, ""I just wish you felt like you could talk with me."" My dad immediately jumped in and said, ""But she couldn't. She didn't feel safe."" He then proceeded to talk about how he knew that it wasn't a choice on my part to remain an addict, and that he was so proud of me for all the work I've done. He told me that he was sorry for making me feel unsafe. He said that he understood my actions and manipulations in active addiction were not truly from me, but rather symptoms of the disease. For the first time in six months he understood. For the first time in six months there was no shame or guilt, simply acceptance of what was, what is, and what is to come.

Thanks for letting me share, guys. I wish I could more accurately portray the significance of everything my dad said to me, but this will have to suffice.",4.511785638410879,5.479633655831741,5.192468132568519,83.71072046951352,69.9942638623327,8.411493520288932,27.529689823666878,8.680891452615391,1.8598188230295305,2074,68,422,34,36,670,222,523,0.099,0.8079999999999999,0.093,0.4646,3,0,2,0,1,0,59.0,4,6,5,4,26,25,5,4,23,0,47,11,1,8,3,88,94,32,0,15,13,12,7,2,0,5,8,5,3,1,33,29,1,2,17,2,0,13,12,12,1,6,49,13,76,13,69,34,12,55,0,1,1,1,75,19,2,4,24,310,109,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3528169273620637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053859118828876326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06051220928650499,0.0,0.0,0.04977205612754879,0.05404541470830701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403191482478014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27878843271416737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2067210760021159,0.0,0.0,0.041744389324024696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06623950926939988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218914850621921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05817360932293821,0.0,0.12204013383989673,0.0,0.16364283013564135,0.046241900110008345,0.12429860970294795,0.1418133457907907,0.0,0.11011569319655527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059840256947092274,0.06763571524722457,0.0,0.07357315265178739,0.0,0.10353824594619644,0.0,0.0,0.06409117923301219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12781156242862496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12985549600010335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0675595131480959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06618905742143101,0.045719502306781463,0.0632459415077989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055029673645134086,0.0,0.061247468825078866,0.04320663320909311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15161797138868302,0.15499649987860964,0.0,0.14274821277125702,0.0,0.09984488833308752,0.0,0.06883926597869136,0.06074311114777942,0.0,0.062108535689562476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04386156145068372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21561930298703125,0.1401888509891963,0.06179047268861145,0.0,0.0,0.0676272816568503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061991804979033414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06506980502170825,0.0,0.0,0.12949160383000866,0.0,0.08293319433532506,0.06655145799701323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3078571107967584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644265491754348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04983099653249808,0.0,0.07245801625872787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740984008156879,0.0,0.14690578269022195,0.0,0.06727747267489878,0.0,0.3121568642306716,0.0,0.05959310878893545,0.0,0.0,0.043002596730084025,0.0,0.06359521188159059,0.05138702848455648,0.07548716763754555,0.0,0.0,0.1237013013713963,0.0,0.0439462569929664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786015769898745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07635683970546886,0.0,0.10384225259098734,0.0,0.058198502238572425,0.0,0.05840720984254055,0.0,0.1488686678232577,0.0,0.0,0.04712296276994002,0.0,0.0,0.13794335066808078,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,michellecolsoh,2019/01/11,"Where do I find support as a parent of an addict? My son is an addict. He was staying at a homeless shelter for a couple weeks but then they told him he couldn’t stay there last night. I don’t understand the rules especially when it’s 20 outside. He cannot stay with me but I felt extremely guilty about saying no. These situations come up - he needs or wants something and I don’t want to help him because I feel like I’m enabling him if I do. But then the guilt sets in and I can’t sleep. Or I will break down in tears. 
Is there a hotline or online support to help me get through these times? I have friends but only 1 knows most of what’s going on. They haven’t been the most supportive and aren’t always available. I’m embarrassed to talk to my other friends. Even thinking about the situation brings me to tears so I’m not sure I could talk to a friend at this point. I do have a counselor but that’s only once a week. They aren’t available at 7 pm when I’m faced with these guilty feelings. 

What resources are available for parents/spouses/friends who need emotional support like this?

Thanks!",1.7749223602484463,4.050636321428573,2.642189440993789,93.46585403726708,80.875,5.324223602484472,24.024844720496894,6.498293943080001,0.596641537267081,872,32,185,8,23,274,126,224,0.104,0.6990000000000001,0.197,0.9716,4,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,3,1,9,13,0,2,13,0,20,4,2,0,1,32,44,18,0,7,10,2,3,2,3,1,2,1,0,0,11,6,0,0,7,0,0,3,10,2,0,0,4,4,22,11,24,37,2,27,0,0,0,0,22,10,0,6,11,115,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2363832457953104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021246103209243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06609060638855986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09339250685601927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656295080042517,0.119962454653487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12195565712957605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07160906636419606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10963879660710643,0.07745384073174727,0.10409828203649063,0.0,0.0990920876744768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33505391086256764,0.0,0.056643930116125576,0.0,0.06161644778942285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14534059984710535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05958369732342516,0.08837514020800695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10593511661114084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16078114620868492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10174294839092593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154616314236884,0.0,0.16491354872504332,0.0,0.0,0.12038535839082233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10249005362093844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862183450338448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437327486594185,0.10849629799920946,0.0,0.0,0.08346547308286338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3466774869910415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4921258455207141,0.10218268175259378,0.0,0.0,0.1742845629030946,0.0,0.0998167278132435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06946987655536191,0.0,0.0,0.0632194075673776,0.0,0.0,0.1035980449758412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11286696137495345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12789549061040684,0.0,0.1739327595594937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,allymaggie,2019/01/11,"Help I realize this may not be allowed, but I didn't see anything against it in the rules.

My husband has steadily decreased the amount of sex we have. We've been married for one year. Our sex life is definitely at it's best when on vacation, which I attribute to him not having much, if any, access to porn. For the record I am not completely against porn. On the odd occasion I watch it myself. 

I recently found something very disturbing on our computer that he definitely uses more as I have a laptop. I was going through it looking for our health insurance info when I came across a folder full of his screen recordings that's he'd done. He is 24 for reference, and I am 22F. On these screen recordings he would have about 4 or 5 windows open in different places on the screen. Some were what I would call ""normal"" porn and some would be transexual, or hentai. However, the most disturbing thing I saw was him on Omegle. 

He keeps his camera off but can see others. The others he talked to on omegle were all young girls. Ages 12 to about 18. And when asked he would say he's 16. He would ask them to flash him or compliment them and he was recording it. So not only was he soliciting minors but he was recording it. Totally illegal.  

On one hand I want to get everything together, take our son, and leave him, reporting him to the police and taking in his computer. 

On the other, I don't want to believe he is a secret pedophile. I want to think that he is so addicted to porn that normal isn't enough for him anymore and he needs more and more ""interesting"" or ""heart racing"" entertainment. 

Does anyone agree with my thoughts? Any tips on how I could talk to him about all this and maybe get him help? what can I do if he wont come into the decision himself? Any tips for how I could help him if we do go this route?

I love my husband so much, but I'm worried we won't make it through this..

addiction,shinykaci,2019/01/11,"Tips on getting my mind off opiates? This is my first post here, I'll try to cover everything but please let me know in the comments if you have a question. Basically, I've been fighting an opiate addiction for a couple years. It started with hydrocodone. I ended up taking several a day, chewing them all up, trying to feel happiness from them. I have depression and anxiety that I have been battling, so I believe they were the biggest instigators. 


Eventually I was forced to quit when my friends and family found out. I haven't had access to any opiates (besides surgeries) until recently when I was prescribed tramadol. It's a low grade opiate, but in higher amounts it still gives you a sort of high. 


I have been abusing it hard, and I really need to find a way to quit. It does help my pain, so I need to find a way to take it as prescribed instead of popping so many every day to fight depressed feelings. I am going to a psychiatrist but have tried different medications all year with no luck. 


Please give me any advice you can think of. It's a bit embarrassing to admit I have such a problem, but I really need help. Thank you so much to anyone who reads this.

addiction,heinz_inthecity,2019/01/11,"What tapering schedules have helped you to stop taking prescribed medication safely? I’m interested to know how people safely quit taking prescription medications that might not yet be formally recognised as addictive or dependency-causing substances that cause a withdrawal syndrome. Drugs like Lyrica (Pregabalin), Neurontin (Gabapentin) and Topamax (topiramate) are substances that come to mind. A lot of people compare coming off these substances as causing a withdrawal syndrome similar to benzo withdrawal, or even benzo and opiates withdrawal combined. There is very little information online about how to taper these types of medications and doctors are generally completely clueless as well, as they don’t even release these substances can cause dependence and withdrawal.

I quit alcohol “cold turkey” in March last year and haven’t had a drink since. However, I was started on Valium for alcohol withdrawals so I was never at a risk for any life-threatening symptoms like seizures. I then had to slowly taper off 10mg of Valium per day. Basically I followed the Ashton Manual and dropped 1mg of Valium every ten days. Once I reached 4mg per day, I dropped 1mg every 14 days. I came off the Valium completely on September 11th, 2018, after taking 1mg a day for two weeks.

So does anyone have any withdrawal or tapering success stories to share for any prescription medication? I’m open to knowing how people tapered off opiates as well (particularly tramadol), but my focus in asking this question is on those substances that the medical community seems totally unable to help with.",11.023592750533046,11.219136604477617,10.456311300639658,54.191567164179105,56.08955223880597,13.925799573560765,46.00852878464819,13.023866798666859,6.780573773987207,1302,72,169,42,14,422,158,268,0.014,0.8690000000000001,0.117,0.9391,2,0,4,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,1,3,12,10,0,1,9,0,15,12,0,7,2,37,29,21,0,0,5,0,0,2,0,1,11,0,0,0,10,11,3,3,5,1,0,4,4,1,2,2,5,1,11,9,35,22,2,34,0,0,0,0,8,12,0,8,18,108,21,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10080582023194973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19764436352022646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886480716592424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06465709138817191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08644685696887904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10576091052450216,0.0,0.3799681624497666,0.0,0.15930923065996389,0.19390582351365854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29817711960088233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946468423092777,0.08092101670893129,0.0,0.0,0.09058528051480798,0.1072357056464422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215096965269127,0.0,0.15581972722386273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1239612251815666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10163805748468596,0.07537529545978032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531421217641921,0.09035222682914147,0.09267911427572373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861458675424536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4657683879554276,0.0,0.09809593169823456,0.09336822042038354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07131847343350098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09847740622922674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19232091899380613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10358743034545184,0.19670620327945326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08418110746714505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07649204178444532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545065827970059,0.0,0.0,0.07730896171413339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09611161327820944,0.20857752929016485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09032963812173192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07629733671653338,0.0,0.0,0.07417376148470291,0.0,0.16628305785367686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05954757213666554
addiction,KingKaleb92,2019/01/11,"Failing hard I’ve been sober now going on 9 months come the 21st and honestly I’m so scared I’m going to blow is. DOC is opiates and alcohol. I want to use and drink so bad. 4 days ago the craving for alcohol were so strong I couldn’t help but shake. I’m working the AA program. Which I also use for NA. I have a sponsor, working the steps, going to meetings every day at least twice a day, I’ve made friends. But at the end of the day when I get home for the night it’s the one thing I want more than anything. I feel like I’m failing at life. Yeah I’m sober but, what’s the point of life if I don’t enjoy it? I have good days and then I have a lot of bad days. You guys ever seen this commercial where the lady has a smiley face in her pocket and she pulls it out to cover her face to show everyone she’s happy when she’s really not? That’s how I feel 90% of the time. I don’t know what to do any suggestions?

addiction,Yernanwasgoodlike,2019/01/12,"My counsellor doesn't understand my solvent abuse My counseller doesn't take my solvent abuse seriously.

As you may know, aerosols are hallucinogens. Inhaling a 330ml can of aerosol is like experiencing a 12h LSD trip condensed into 20-30 minutes.  Now, for me this was a form of escapism. I suffered with depression and would use hallucinogens to escape for a breif time. Due to the nature of hallucinogens, this half hour trip felt like 4-6 hours. I abused solvents every single day, never missing a day from the age of 12-16. 

There were times when I was trapped in a BT commercial, times when my bedroom was a beach and a squid-like mermaid attacked my face. Then there were darker times.

One of these times causes a lot of damage to my perception of reality. I woke up and walked to school. I did my day to day stuff in school and at 1pm went for lunch. I blinked and I was laid in my bed staring at the wall. The 5 hours from being awake to lunch had only been 7 minutes. Everything was vividly real, it was a shock to the system. 

My mum absolutely hates animals. I have never been allowed a pet because of this. I have frequently hallucinated my mum violently throwing cats at my wall, screaming ""CATS, CATS, CATS, CATS, CATS"" getting faster and faster as it happened. As comedic as this sounds, it was traumatising at the time.

Another time my bed turned into a giant wasp that wrapped its legs around me and starting biting into my shoulder. Everything felt real. I could hear its wings buzzing, getting more and more distressed in sound. I could feel the warmth of its body on my back. I could feel the pain of its pincers in my shoulder and blood pouring down my chest. Horrifying.

When I first started taking it, I had a good trip every time.  Then I had my first bad trip, transparent spiders with wings flying under my eyelids. The only way to permanently get rid of them was to grab their wings hanging out of my eyelids and slide their giant wings out of my eye and snap them in half. I'm aware this is all fake, but the experience was real, that is what's important.

Then when I experienced my first bad trip, they got more prevalent. Then it was a 50/50 chance of getting a bad trip. Now I cannot take aerosols without having a bad trip and that's the worst part. I didn't willingly choose to stop abusing solvents, I'm too scared to take it anymore. I have been clean for 5 years and I'm still mentally dependant on it. I still crave it. I still can't have a can of deodorant or hairspray in sight of me and not have a craving to take it and be out of touch with reality for 30 minutes. It was an escape. 


My counsellor doesn't see this though. She only understands that I have seen things and that it was imaginary. She doesn't understand how real it was to me at the time or how much it's traumatised me. She doesn't understand the damage it has done to me. Only that I was an addict and now ""I'm not"".

addiction,d0ctor_foreskin,2019/01/12,"Son of an addict My mother is a meth addict. She has a minimum wage job but what really feeds her addiction is her oil shares she has inherited that have a monthly payout. She will never run out of money for drugs and never make enough money to live on her own either. She also lives in my house with my father. She doesn’t see this as a burden to me, she sees it as doing a favor because I make her pay a small amount of rent. She doesn’t openly talk about it, in fact, she denies it. Sometimes I don’t think that she really believes she is a meth addict. 

There is NO talking to her about it. Last time my dad and I tried to talk to her she elevated the level of violence to the point in which the cops were called and she was arrested. It’s easy to say, “just kick her out” but it’s tough because she was a pretty good mom most of my life until she hit 55. 

She started using meth when she was 55 years old. I found about a quarter of methamphetamine on the floor and it was hers. My parents lost their house 3 years ago and with nowhere to go, I let them in my house. I feel like things aren’t as terrible but she has erratic behavior sometimes. She locks herself in the bathroom for hours. She does “projects around the house” but most of it is counterproductive busy work. Taking apart old appliances and never putting them back together.

She’s ruined a few of the rooms in my house from her so called projects, she also hoards. I guess it is bad and I’ve been lying to myself. It’s fucking tough. I want to scream at the top of my lungs, “mother I fucking hate you.” Life would be so much better if she wasn’t blasted out of her fucking mind all day. As I type this I can hear her using a saw. The thing about these projects she does in my house is she has no idea what she is doing and I end up having to fix it. 

I’ve got to build up the courage to do something about this. I haven’t had a GF for 2 years now because I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of this situation. I’ve got so much weight on my shoulders for a 30 year old. I accept this as my fault. I eternalize this as if I’ve done something wrong or I’m not good enough. I don’t want to have kids of my own either, I don’t want to bring them into this and have to take care of even more people. I’m such a push over.

She makes some passive aggressive comments to me every once in awhile, that’s what upset me today. Her perspective on things is insane. Im sure she’s just projecting. Hell if I was a 60 year old drug addict and lived off my child I would be so ashamed I would have to make up my own reality too. I’m willing to admit I’m wrong at a lot of things, I am human of course. But she lives under my roof. 

I dream of what it would be like to have parents like some of my friends. Parents that support them instead of becoming dependent off them. The idea that some parents actually pay for their kids college and encourage them and love them, I can’t even imagine. I had to join the military to pay for my college. I’ve had to figure out everything on my own.

addiction,DaceSpace,2019/01/12,"I’m 16 and addicted to nicotine. Is it ok for me to use nicotine gum? I know your probably thinking I’m just another high schooler who juuls because it looks cool, but I started because of severe untreated depression. My parents knew about my depression but they saw antidepressants as addictive and unsafe. I have been using my juul for around a year now and have not been able to quit. I have tried quitting multiple times after being caught many times, but I couldn’t survive cold turkey for more than a few days. After being caught yesterday,  I realized how big my addiction was for nicotine. I bought nicotine gum this morning and used two pieces and i haven’t been having any cravings. I would like to use this to help me quit but I don’t know if it’s the right thing to do. Is it ok to use these to help me quit? Would it be ok for me to use these in school?",3.0885658914728684,5.0699435930232575,4.043627906976745,86.49517054263569,75.27906976744184,7.377364341085273,26.582945736434112,8.238735603445708,1.7672266666666672,686,26,136,12,15,221,99,172,0.076,0.812,0.111,0.5007,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,1,5,5,7,0,0,3,4,19,3,0,7,0,28,37,12,0,4,7,1,0,1,0,2,3,0,0,0,11,6,0,0,5,0,1,2,4,2,0,1,9,4,20,5,22,22,3,16,0,2,2,0,6,5,0,1,10,93,31,1,0.11046226096321164,0.0,0.0,0.3612605078760099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751181253673153,0.1158293120018871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983348316165634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13467353801907095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07123902000642582,0.0,0.1902819670113552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480810501582253,0.11670944350660245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12141433957537592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05396628104230376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09276047857777248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1119913948792705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12265526847240638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11909700028395985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699608464113546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943341673070429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11179370539342737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12479091305590274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07818575685589818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07338621784603844,0.07077975655461803,0.0,0.0,0.1288228653632405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499662426077684,0.0,0.10790557816677336,0.0,0.0,0.5724235621495682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569384417423369,0.0,0.0,0.07113407441282174

When I turned 17 I became depressed and was put on klonopin and I hate to say it but for the first time in my life I felt normal I laughed made jokes and actually made friends... my tolerance however didn’t sit well with doctors and I completely understand so I’ve moved to other Benzos I could get my hands on ,tried quitting relapsed and I’m currently a month and a half off and I’m back to who I was before and I honestly hate my life I’m seriously contemplating just buying powder from the deep web and taking normal doses and never stopping but I know people shouldn’t be dependent on something... but do some people just so mentally challenged that this would be something to consider...... I’ve tried the anti depressants they put me on I WILL NEVER Take Them Again they make you crazy psychotic and voilent not to mention the twitching  and I’ve tried multiple forms from snris to sris .

i was sober from opiates (oxy) for ALMOST 5 whole years. I had done really good and didn't miss it at all. but about a week before Thanksgiving, which was 2 whole weeks before 5 years came, I was very suicidal and decided to end it. for whatever reason, I found myself texting my old dealer and long story short I simultaneously relapsed while trying to make an attempt in my life

addiction,c6230,2019/01/12,"Kratom addiction..80 grams per day Went to rehab for kratom + other drug abuse, relapsed on kratom when I got out for about 20ish days (80gpd), CT quit for approx 20ish days, relapsed again for like 25 days (80gpd again), now im 10 days off it.

Taking a ton of gabapentin for withdrawals - which helps a lot but may become an issue on its own. Taking naltrexone which blocks the effects of kratom and helps with cravings- having my parents make sure that I take it. This is fucking hard and annoying. Now that Im not taking kratom I am having cravings for other drugs (xanax, adderall, alc, etc). Took xanax a week ago which I am very ashamed about because I had been like 90 days clean from it. Took some adderall yesterday, also was like \~100 days clean from that. Adderall hadnt been a huge issue for me but still am mad at myself for giving in to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with depression and that is a main reason that I used kratom (it initially demolished my depression). Having an addictive personality though, I took kratom way too far and used it like a straight fiend. Unlike other drugs, kratom is very easily accesible since I can drive 10 mins to a smoke shop and buy it. That is one of the main reasons kratom was my drug of choice. My mind craves drugs, craves an altered state. It is incredibly difficult for me to stay sober. I am going to twelve step meetings, I have a sponsor, but still my mind screams for drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at my life now and am really angry and depressed on what it has come to. I was a good student, excercised every day in high school, and my mood used to be.. okay. not great, but okay. Once I got to college and started drinking heavily and using other drugs, I rapidly grew an obsession with drugs. Discovered kratom and from there my life went very downhill. Using it every day has had an extreme negative effect on my body, sleep patterns, personality, and so on. My GPA in high school was like 3.5, first semester of college it was 3.5, then next semester when I started taking kratom my gpa dropped form like 3 to 2 to eventually 1.7 last semester. Got suspended from school for drinking, my mind was so warped with addiction that when I drank I would go crazy with it and to stupid shit. I blame this on my kratom use because I would usually drink when I couldnt get kratom, so then I would be drinking while withdrawing from kratom. Got arrested for being to drunk and going crazy (angry, manic drunk).

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to share my story. I am feeling decent at the moment only because I am on gabapentin. I know when I run out I will feel like shit again and then who knows what.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Also feel I should mention during this relaspe I spent probably 600 dollars on kratom. Also, want to ask if anyone has been on doses of kratom this high (80g per day)? At doses this high, I would experience uncontrollable hand shaking and weird dizziness. The shaking was embarassing and hard to hide.. I really dont even know why that didnt stop me.",5.121430038510916,6.5394207228070185,5.1098459563543015,83.18928754813868,68.96491228070175,8.01711596063329,28.11296534017972,8.407314429234152,1.9221193838254176,2372,81,446,35,41,738,259,570,0.165,0.73,0.104,-0.9927,1,0,13,0,1,0,102.0,0,0,0,4,26,32,6,6,18,2,46,30,5,11,1,67,88,38,0,9,8,1,6,7,0,7,17,1,2,2,36,25,7,2,10,7,4,15,7,18,0,2,25,8,49,13,64,52,8,84,0,3,1,1,11,26,3,4,46,276,85,9,0.0,0.0565834710978153,0.0,0.10412295136902226,0.0,0.0,0.04233312695449384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145722187084226,0.0,0.20697596129644436,0.23211679243235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03339235357037102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044645744975162535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08733549163087596,0.05274314169818082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05304654413021242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04113787090486467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30798897972478023,0.0,0.12339743487747032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055970091993340534,0.1871321861394503,0.4430576781521349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05326095927060385,0.031542621853482465,0.0,0.08047357703519957,0.0,0.0,0.046714878585639115,0.0,0.0,0.07244114350535548,0.034117149312854186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04062153087933135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04414998034956697,0.02495072424015529,0.045812246998180366,0.08142311070047828,0.040055764505762086,0.15278047779757495,0.052651549609829686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556062694664712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06402015573865558,0.20182884282576075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10317011613358464,0.09969045355376543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07873693075733994,0.038927803005450505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746345124223155,0.16331939834914147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04010331017098987,0.0,0.0,0.04060074495040766,0.0,0.0,0.031877737571197044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14466091320730848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050789424967292364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05085895911644677,0.032360941863287015,0.03632085970437087,0.0,0.0,0.05302778026884419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339801368514463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05148942756712548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05079476162915047,0.0,0.0,0.061187887335923924,0.0982029728047797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449959415247513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09804242356700456,0.03950455007713285,0.0,0.047790843730409385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06760438726104248,0.050901919884739966,0.07627657304527932,0.03992645088561581,0.0,0.049925310909206384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045009799095891236,0.0,0.17953417677156575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04692037598336557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15917720164166269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2474769429183156,0.05259687769345831,0.1182119821391567,0.05633587060851174,0.03790677145552577,0.03830726709111863,0.0,0.0,0.088541238444626,0.04309268205684906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13569897662112507,0.0,0.23211679243235,0.0

addiction,aishaalovee,2019/01/12,"Felling hopeless Since I was like 16 I’ve dibbled and dabbled in different drugs . I am now 24. I have tried many drugs but I was mainly addicted to things like ecstasy and cocaine. I just didn’t feel normal if I didn’t do coke. My family learned about my addiction because I got involved with a guy who was abusive and was basically my pimp. I was living a very reckless life. They found out because he put me in the hospital and I confessed to my aunt and mom that I was using drugs and needed help. My mom offered nothing and my aunt told me to stay at her home. I went to live there And I just felt like a burden. My family not wanting me to touch them or share anything with me because I guess they thought since I was a prostitute I was infected. It’s like they never saw me the same after that. I had felt a distant connection from them. I ultimately ended up leaving and going back to that fast life with my boyfriend. That was years ago. Fast forward About 6 months ago I had a complete break down. Me and my boyfriend got into a argument &amp; physical fight  and he called me all types of names. Instead of doping myself up , which Is what I wanted to do, I went to my aunt and begged her to help me . Before I went to her I really just wanted to rent a motel room and buy a bunch of drugs and kill myself by overdosing. I told her I was really done with the drugs I just needed a place to lay my head. I explained to her that I can’t be by myself right now or I will most likely hurt myself and that I’ve been going through depression. She said no and that she just couldn’t do it for another time and that she will call the police to stop me from killing myself. That really hurt me to the core. Like I can still feel the feeling of abandonment and embarrassment from that day. I know she’s tried her best to help me in the past but I can’t help but wonder how is it that she could turn me away at a time like that . She was basically my mother figure my whole life. When I left I thought long and hard about just going through with my plan and taking my pain away instead I went to my friends house and he let my sleep on his couch. I know he is disgusted and disappointed with me but he has been generous with helping me. As of now I am about 4 weeks clean of coke but I have had baddddd cravings ! I am going to try my best to stay clean. I know my friend is getting tired of me and I am overstaying my welcome. I have to think of somewhere to go and I need money. It’s tempting to go back to my old life. My mom didn’t even raise me or ever really showed me genuine love so I know better than to even ask her. But I wonder should I ask my aunt to stay at her house again. I still feel a feeling of hurt and anger towards her but I have no more options. I really have a strong dislike for her now, I don’t want to say hate , because I don’t hate her . If I hated her I wouldn’t feel so sad for disappointing her. I’ve spent so much of my life whoring and being an addict I just don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I look in the mirror and still see a drug addicted ho. I would just really like some encouragement and advice . Mainly advice on staying clean and forgiving family. Are they even worth forgiving?

addiction,mdmeray,2019/01/12,"Can you be addicted to Kratom? Kratom - is it just a drug or does it have therapeutic effects?

More me it just makes my depression and anxiety less noticeable. It’s not a high. And cravings for other “harder” drugs is gone.

What do you think about Kratom?",1.5254464285714278,4.261266604166668,2.571785714285717,88.83750000000002,91.29166666666666,6.909523809523809,21.44047619047619,7.957251820313856,1.5217226190476194,199,7,39,5,7,63,38,48,0.121,0.879,0.0,-0.7131,0,0,2,0,0,0,7.0,0,2,0,1,3,1,0,0,2,0,6,3,0,2,0,9,9,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,6,2,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,4,0,3,7,2,2,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,29,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3156284966766913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22148829646241347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2493702323522065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25336809714578723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6715216340757131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3059024615107261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932623356284236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32962979839664885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.185517993271579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Matanzohar7,2019/01/12,"I smoke cigarettes, smoke weed, drink alcohol, drink Red Bull’s, and take adderall. I wouldn’t really consider this post a “help I’m trying to quit” but rather seeking comfort from people who were or who are in this situation. I consider myself to have a healthy lifestyle: I work full time, have a great relationship with gf, and spend time with friends and family. The vices listed above don’t seem to inhibit any of these things and if that day ever comes I’ll start to become worried. To do this I’ve learned that moderation and tolerance is key meaning I have a few cigs a day, smoke weed and drink beer when I get off. I take week long tolerance breaks from the adderall but I dunno, when I pile it all together it gets me thinking about the big picture. Any feedback or comfort is encouraged.

addiction,Ta-karo,2019/01/12,"How to help (or not help) my drug addicted sister? My sister is 29 years old (I am 27), and has struggled with addiction since she was about 18. Unfortunately, my father and brother were also addicts and basically got her hooked on pills. She has not held a job for 10 years, and has a 4 year old. She has been living with my mother for 2 years (after moving out of the abusive baby daddy's house) and has been making my mom's life hell.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister has been taking methadone from a methadone clinic for about 7 years now. She will often show up high, nodding off, and looking terrible. She gets her son (shared custody) every other week and will often leave him in the house to smoke or sleep in her room. She will fall asleep standing up and say that she is severely sleep deprived. If you even utter the words drug addict to her, she will fly off the handle. In the last few months, I have been suspecting meth use and possibly heroin use. She made friends with a neighbor I know does meth and recently stopped being friends. While she was there, she would act extremely shady (nobody could go in, she had to know the exact time you were arriving to see her, would make you wait outside the door for 10 mins, etc). She blames the nodding off on the methadone and being tired. Lately, her skin has been breaking out in sores and my mother found a bent and worn out spoon on the counter which she said was someone else's that they gave her. She blames the sores on hormonal acne.

&amp;#x200B;

Talking to my sister is absolutely exhausting and she is in complete denial. I once asked her to go to treatment and she claimed that the courts would take her custody of my nephew away if she did (not sure if that's true.) she has an excuse for EVERYTHING and she is very manipulating. I have dealt with addiction from my father who passed from it, and my older brother who I have stepped away from since he won't get help. The only reason I am even trying to help is for the sake of my innocent nephew.

&amp;#x200B;

I want my sister to get help, but I have no idea where to start. On top of it all, my 4 year old nephew is in possible danger. I am on the brink of calling CPS anonymously, but I would be gutted if he was placed into the system. He does have a grandma on the dad's side who is well off and retired and I'm certain she would take him in, but I don't know how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? Where do I start? Any advice would be so appreciated.

addiction,Dipstick124,2019/01/13,"Am I doing this wrong? This seems a little off-brand for this subreddit, and I honestly still like a jack*** for comparing myself to you guys, but I'm at my wit's end. I'm a sex addict and a christian, so on top of suffering from withdrawal, I'm also having an identity crisis. Oh, and I'm applying to college. I got so desperate earlier that I ran to the bathroom in the middle of family night and jacked off. It didn't help. I'm still panicking and shaking and probably in a bit of denial. I don't know what to do anymore.",0.3923994354269595,2.6794213944954173,3.5937614678899084,84.23103740296402,87.34862385321102,7.757515878616798,23.06351446718419,8.617729084823388,2.0710361326746654,408,16,83,12,13,147,72,109,0.223,0.7090000000000001,0.067,-0.9655,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,0,1,5,5,0,1,8,0,6,2,0,0,0,9,15,10,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,6,6,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,3,0,8,2,15,12,1,14,1,1,0,1,3,8,0,1,5,55,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2733113212001765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2004930008630213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2486373297610045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27371080230017353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22205498251274955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23634743426722984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005159942713288,0.0,0.0,0.2482426935184425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16804588343217766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13778386858735509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248442813733487,0.2512776654371384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352747086957633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2703081941336254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2282373145617969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4004352677584464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27411244411560776,0.0,0.0
addiction,Rileyriot664,2019/01/13,"How can I be a friend to someone fighting addiction? I wasn't sure where to post this so if there are any more appropriate subreddit please let me know. 


I have a friend who is a heroin addict. We'll call him Neil. Neil was my brothers best friend roomate and handmade during college but as my brother hit senior year he broke up the band and slowly loosened ties with Neil before moving to California when he graduated. He did this because Neil is addicted to heroin and the stress of being in a band and being so close to him was too much. My brother is 2 years older than me and I go to the same college so after he moved I ran into Neil at a few parties and we became closer friends. Neil is the first addict I have ever personally known and I want to support him but not enable him. 

He came over on New Years Eve, I was having a low key gathering and it was a good time. I invited him to stay the night after since we were drinking and smoking and I learned he moved out of his exgirlfriend's apartment. I didn't want him to be alone after a stressful day like that. His gf texted me earlier in the day asking me to look out for him because she was afraid he would/ had relapsed. He was fine at the party though and we talked and I thought it would be ok.

 At 4 am one of my other friends wakes me up and he's gone. We call text and finally hear from him after about an hour. He comes back and I could tell he used so I pull him aside and call him out on it. His first reaction was that he would leave but I told him not to as it was late(early) and I'd rather him just wait it out here since he at least had the respect not to use or bring it in my house. (His families house is walking distance from mine). I was really freaked out though, I had seen him high before but not in a one on one situation while I was still drunk from the night before. My eyes kept drifting to the track mark on his arm, I've never seen one so fresh so close.

I hear him again at 9 am he says he's going for a jog but comes back again obviously high. This time I pulled him aside and had a more in depth conversation about it trying to get across that he's my friend and I understand addiction is a disease and that I'm here if he needs to talk while also telling him it's not cool to be high around my friends. It seemed like he really appreciated the support and cried because ""I was being so nice"". 

So the past few days we've been trying to hang out but he's been acting strange like texting me at 9 am and then nothing all day or severely misspelled texts. I had a feeling he was still in his relapse when I fell asleep early and woke up at 11pm to a call from my neighbor about some sketchy dude she ran into outside of my apartment and i had a missed call from him but no messages. I figured if he needed me he'd have said something more and decided to go back to sleep. 

This morning I got a text from his mom informing me he'd been kicked out of the family house, and asking me not to enable him by taking him in. I've never even met him mom so that makes me think I might be some of the only support he has outside of his family. He might be coming over tonight and I'm not sure if hell be high or not but I'm really just looking for advice on how to support without enabling. I mean I don't want him to go sleep at his dealers house and die but his mother said he needs to learn to live with the consequences of his actions. But he's been on heroin for 6 years so maybe their strategy isn't working? I just feel like I have a responsibility as his friend and I don't want to contribute to him being just another overdose in the opioid epidemic. If you have any advice or resources it would be very appreciated.",3.0736984904120765,4.134301040051678,4.295711954304366,88.45004283965729,73.48320413436694,7.240364477084182,25.206854345165237,7.6056303175797355,1.0746635658914725,2911,90,640,35,57,957,310,774,0.079,0.7909999999999999,0.13,0.9916,0,1,3,0,2,0,44.0,5,1,1,7,40,34,2,3,34,2,70,13,6,5,7,129,127,71,1,18,33,6,2,4,10,7,5,5,1,1,21,51,2,2,14,5,0,24,17,9,0,6,40,13,99,25,98,63,12,118,1,3,5,0,113,50,1,14,46,435,120,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28667357666417864,0.0,0.10278758577511823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054471040010919035,0.0,0.04205903026712928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07153081347739466,0.05514890628265725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04681939588015841,0.09833570967082207,0.0,0.0,0.12132354409434876,0.0,0.09618159080725547,0.0,0.13425967162286134,0.0,0.05519366933889616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2685193934407171,0.0601529920029555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359140181900998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04199165745283208,0.0,0.05777152767388661,0.13567391431760262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054583785011060336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05152164091032795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034737533291987435,0.04757386268539091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14874150990729956,0.0,0.05318574226150025,0.037572831313391064,0.0,0.057613645921869676,0.0,0.08947206658006314,0.0,0.0,0.3250690722318484,0.0,0.02747795088111554,0.0,0.11956046992894552,0.04411296117102256,0.042063853779430393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185534707624388,0.0,0.0,0.222271825706496,0.0,0.0,0.05179403698801675,0.24274350831548325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028904030935209383,0.0,0.05932779734684844,0.05568895876978769,0.0,0.0537804520007068,0.0,0.10277817675640047,0.0,0.04644105422248468,0.0,0.08833064535057697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035106592448035163,0.0,0.05283727411630586,0.05728977702433101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11158685691533098,0.0,0.12319382312390255,0.0,0.1676958104928424,0.038662299098025585,0.11699231751066265,0.08112675166718591,0.05079516302386741,0.0,0.09871093805300243,0.0,0.05046491448305751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14255495951575664,0.0399997526849497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05020647943922641,0.0,0.04592264540231123,0.0,0.05773190696701981,0.0,0.0,0.05037006753071848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10107829415407488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005698957072943,0.04182448931481566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04787917822528552,0.0,0.05941572344774945,0.0,0.08701182988933304,0.059117335979801476,0.1052630331650112,0.0,0.04456233082224997,0.040489072084831934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05605770962336834,0.08400252863782047,0.0,0.12049143137312547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2387300772178584,0.09913756705589563,0.0,0.039543792343078636,0.08454538110208885,0.09193813402135148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03369981305661497,0.1033457605626896,0.041753391369157435,0.06133542543069734,0.0,0.0,0.050255375737344295,0.0,0.07141511473029999,0.0,0.0,0.05475172387233124,0.0,0.09084785430495362,0.0,0.04339517372340662,0.12408411639885378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05069829012667902,0.0,0.038288719255266,0.0,0.0,0.14944375074339375,0.0,0.0,0.1354740466120479

addiction,bayareadude7,2019/01/13,"I'm trying to quit smoking weed (5 days in) Hey Reddit,
I'm on a crusade of stopping an 8 year habit.
I've been a daily toker for that long and I've noticed weed really makes my depression worse.
I moved to a different city and have very few friends since I always rather stay in and smoke. I was always a social person growing up and weed had taken that from me. Which of course, makes me more depressed. I don't have co-workers because I'm a coach and I work with youth and college athletes. My best friend now is one of my assistant coaches and she's a pretty heavy user too so that makes things hard, of course.

5 days in I just had a pretty real nightmare and keep waking up to it. Falling asleep again would take me back to it instantly.

This is not my first time trying to quit. Wish me luck folks and Godspeed to those battling your demons.
Any advice is most appreciated.

If anyone lives in Santa Cruz, CA and wants to hang out, hmu.

Peace
:)

addiction,siflyx,2019/01/13,"I don’t know what to do in my free time. Its always video games or weed or Netflix I’ve always had a technology addiction. I love playing video games/watching Netflix and I can’t get enough of it. Around 2-3 years ago I started smoking weed. It use to be just at parties, but a couple months ago I started smoking weed every single day. I know you can’t get addicted to weed but it’s become such a bad habit to smoke everyday. My school grades have always suffered because of the video games. Most recently my grades have dropped so low because I smoke weed everyday. The problem is I don’t know what to do in my free time. I can’t get video games or weed off my mind. Even when I’m studying I itch to play some games. 

I want to completely stop playing video games, and learn to better manage my weed. I need to find better ways to spend my free time also.

addiction,Katsie463,2019/01/13,"Anyone in recovery think about their rituals when using and miss them like crazy? For example, say when you got home from work you would take a cocktail of your preferred drugs and just relax and enjoy the evening. Or going to certain events where you had a great time bring high. Do you think of those times and have a moment of ""I miss that""? I am a recovering opiate addict and I find myself missing things like that. I miss taking an oxy and either focusing on a game or going out and having fun. Do those feelings eventually go away? I am 10 months clean so I know I am still early on. Just curious if anyone feels the same.",3.6748780487804846,5.456541081300813,4.460658536585368,84.9895243902439,73.14634146341464,7.196422764227643,22.86910569105691,7.908726449838941,1.1013973983739844,495,13,96,7,10,159,86,123,0.07,0.7340000000000001,0.196,0.9568,0,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,0,5,2,1,9,11,0,0,8,0,9,2,0,1,1,25,26,13,0,3,6,0,2,2,0,1,2,1,2,0,5,8,1,0,7,3,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,3,15,7,12,23,2,20,1,4,0,0,9,7,0,3,11,69,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21716221971862928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785767221396103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18715910848329864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23101388211207774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315726396031741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20144747871933066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820692295136369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3396373849113181,0.0,0.15932197105423676,0.21962357452533496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2104704051076502,0.1998182737779135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10947753870003477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19464243324036445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15900306623570612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15841534898145346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590849058469074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995538626629392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13234256402310918,0.255284295561371,0.0,0.0,0.23231539664222334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17204865833038918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14502318909910145,0.0,0.0,0.14150910336833367,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,LoveBateman,2019/01/14,"Is smoking weed okay when you’re trying to stay sober? I’m asking because my friend is in recovery, from meth mostly, but still wants to smoke weed. He says that things are different with weed and that it helps relieve stress and stuff for him. He still stays away from alcohol and everything else (so he says, who knows if that’s actually true). But for some reason thinks weed is okay. I’m not an addict and have never even done drugs so I don’t have a whole lot of knowledge on these things. But I feel like if you’re trying to really get sober and stay sober, you’re not supposed to be getting high on anything, regardless of what it is, right?

I hope this is the right subreddit to ask this type of question. Thanks in advance guys.

addiction,justiceT,2019/01/14,"Is there any kind of help for nitrous? :( does anyone know of any good way to get off of nitrous? I've only recently discovered I was addicted to it. I'm trying to get off it, I gave my mom my canister and told her it was something else and not to give it back until at least 3 months. But, since then, I've had withdrawals and cheated with a cracker. Then when I found that I had that, I started doing them again after about a 3 day break. This stuff is killing me, I'm on SSRIs and I don't think they mix good. It makes me more depressed than anything, especially when I realize how much money I am blowing. I spent over $800 doing over 2000 during December alone. Trying to stop them now, easing out with a cracker (instead of canister) and I keep buying them. I can't stop.. it's a habit I can't kick. First REAL time dealing with addiction. 38M taking about 2500 ug B12 a day to deal, but not sure what else to do  :\*(  


Any ideas or suggestions are welcome, this is hard for me to reach out for help. I've never been through anything like this. I started slow, and over the last cpl years, it pretty much took over my life. All thoughts and actions, nitrous is in my head..

Also, not sure if this is a physical addiction or all in my head as a habit. As I mention below, the only other ""addiction"" I've struggled with is weed.

addiction,pengepuzzler,2019/01/14,"Do you believe an addictive personality can be hereditary? Please be gentle, first post.

I'm struggling with low mood, anxiety and stress, treating it with alcohol at the moment, reasonably successfully (as in minimal effects on life or work, doesn't take too long to get to where I feel like sleep is winning).

My question is because during these times I keep thinking about drugs. My mum died about five years ago, linked to heroin. She was into it when I was a baby then was clean for a long time before walking out when I was 17 and going back to Scotland. My real dad was always into it, did a few years for carrying when he was 50ish, he passed last year from cancer. I always remember the paraphanelia when I visited as a kid. He had no toys so I enjoyed playing with the little brass weights, or we would spend the day at the pub where I would play pool with the other kids.

I smoked a bit when I was younger, but my only  exposure to harder stuff was through my dad and his friends at parties (late teens, early twenties). However I joined the Army at eighteen so I've been very careful, and I never really felt the urge to partake outside of being around my dad, his girlfriend or his mates.

Now I've just left the Army after 22 years, and have been lucky enough to find a decent(ish) job, but I'm really struggling with what the fuck I do with the rest of my life. I'm not sure what I'm asking really, just want to know what's wrong with me

addiction,Flippiewulf,2019/01/14,"Short Attention Span, Any Recovery Advice?  

Hi guys,

A bit of background. I'd been regularly skiing for almost two years, at one point it was pretty bad, doing it daily and ended up in the hospital.

I finally cut it back to a few times a week, and I'm now celebrating almost three months totally sober! Huge steps for me.

I find my problem now is I have ZERO attention span! I used to be a very detail oriented person, very self-motivated etc. Now I sit at work and can't focus on a task for very long, don't think twice about details etc. and it's starting to really affect my work as well as my ability to enjoy my own personal hobbies. I was/am a HUGE gamer, but now when I pick up a game I have no desire to play it, nor can I really ""get into it"". 

Has anyone here gotten clean and experienced the same thing? I'm due to start a new job soon and really need to excel, but I'm worried this will continue. I work in HR/Accounting so the devil is in the details, and I find myself missing the most obvious things. 

For reference; I exercise 5 days a week, eat a very healthy diet, don't smoke (anymore).

TL;DR Cocaine ruined my attention span and self-motivation, any tips on getting it back?",3.8015735294117654,4.789855441666667,5.944215686274513,77.59058823529412,71.66666666666666,9.480392156862747,27.450980392156865,9.773937934552695,2.589428921568628,926,32,182,23,17,326,148,240,0.102,0.7609999999999999,0.13699999999999998,0.7613,1,0,2,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,0,4,12,10,1,0,15,0,14,3,0,3,2,30,26,15,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,10,9,2,0,7,4,0,1,5,6,1,5,3,1,19,4,25,21,8,41,1,2,0,0,5,17,0,3,22,118,29,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566412853163816,0.0,0.0,0.2370493017364807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16098343280720945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11738548321064425,0.08276300230992119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18202953067041852,0.09882916479309377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12922305278480395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07633511841767741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12111612854544015,0.0,0.0,0.1048355508267624,0.0,0.2640147473194491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12966219795574846,0.2163654729952776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12368082073462752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117199169409454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11745820682566192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10474859427682097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944771769663892,0.0,0.0,0.0877655561724663,0.0,0.1143168840959453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020664672641974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20670211174904526,0.0,0.0,0.1118924298065698,0.0,0.0,0.1204189463753504,0.0,0.11325855610753692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.227481416527748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2469593544160766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16755758312319213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15727183302065398,0.07584300145740061,0.0,0.0,0.06901911818495304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11562462659572813,0.0,0.0,0.10222866718692132,0.0,0.3906514517952134,0.0,0.0,0.1898892468341693,0.0,0.10642363278161776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25851164682135763,0.12020459290827222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07622266551876809
addiction,BubblySun,2019/01/14,"I have lost 80,000 USD over the past 4 years gambling on various things. I have an addiction and for years I would chase losses. What do I do? I know I have to just stop and accept the fact that I’ll never make it back but it’s very depressing and weighs down on me daily. Also can you guys tell me how much any of you are down gambling so I can feel like I am not alone here?

addiction,absolutetrash0987,2019/01/14,"addicted to fire? sorry if my post somehow breaks a rule/doesnt belong here/doesnt fit the format etc. first time poster on reddit. also excuse the english.

ever since childhood ive been super into burning things but itd mostly be small stuff like trashcans or unused textbooks i found laying around. ive been abstaining from that for a few years now but recently ive been getting the urge to burn bigger stuff like a thrown away couch i saw on my way home and even a shack thats a few meters away from my house. since i forgot about it i havent been feeling the need to burn things for a while but now resisting it has been really annoying and its affecting my social life and grades aswell. is this a real thing or am i just really fixated on fire or something? ive recently got into recovery for mdma addiction(a month or so clean) and i feel like a massive disappointment to everyone around me by coming out with yet another addiction.

ps. i dont plan on acting out on burning actual big things but the feeling i get around oil tanks etc have been disturbing me alot.",3.4283253588516738,5.675912215311008,4.565071770334927,81.92550239234453,75.17224880382776,7.844976076555024,23.918660287081337,8.6894789155246,1.8654918660287088,859,27,156,18,19,281,130,209,0.108,0.8190000000000001,0.073,-0.8025,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,3,13,7,1,1,14,0,18,3,0,1,1,36,29,16,0,2,10,0,5,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,13,13,0,2,4,0,0,2,2,3,0,1,10,7,18,4,26,17,6,36,0,1,1,0,2,19,0,8,15,113,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.1191563772538858,0.2662238544568637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976469237479621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280372137056811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3260966753440693,0.0,0.0,0.2294423925197137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10518221403105796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431055634599064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27235758653895964,0.08064887000511707,0.11045050997447686,0.0,0.11667608148314515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18521911059655385,0.08723147849466947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386202448590516,0.0,0.13388128071153108,0.0,0.0,0.12758912211704085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976581223213689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248076830536635,0.0,0.0,0.1408921978006214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08624601871404974,0.17896227144822513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746264616970657,0.0,0.0,0.09053893883988168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694235725629056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13898165195706205,0.15644653746809126,0.0,0.2411269239635758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20201220675823905,0.0,0.0,0.12447015976467107,0.0,0.09400200882860676,0.0,0.1366859898058478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2795608762557795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244832139640718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120011531460484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969208678223068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863129401305513
addiction,garryxdlsd,2019/01/14,"Getting over nicotine addiction by getting overdosed? I heard somewhere that when you get nicotine overdose, you will no longer want to use nicotine products anymore. Since I’m addicted to nicotine and I’ve been using snus for about 3 years or more and my gums aren’t doing too well, I thought it’s worth a try. I’ve been trying to quit and it’s been impossible for me, I thought maybe I should put like 5-10 snus pouches under my lip and if it kicks in and I feel sick, I will no longer want to use nicotine ever again. I’m wondering will this method work? I know it may be dangerous for my health, but cmon, if this works, it would be way more healthier than snusing everyday. And I’ve been using nicotine gum and nicotine bandages, which didn’t work too well and I see people around me every day who smoke/ use snus so sooner or later I get temptated and start again. But if I’d feel sick about using nicotine again, I’m sure my problem would be gone.",5.220375218150085,5.675005937172777,5.321164921465968,85.26178228621292,68.16230366492147,8.042059336823735,31.09991273996509,7.793537801064563,1.94658080279232,758,29,153,8,12,238,107,191,0.086,0.845,0.069,-0.7278,1,0,2,0,0,0,19.0,0,2,0,4,13,6,1,0,1,0,17,6,1,6,2,38,42,18,0,9,7,0,2,1,0,7,5,1,0,0,10,10,0,0,6,0,1,2,4,2,2,0,9,4,17,4,15,23,2,17,0,0,1,0,4,4,0,7,11,90,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26509530162922856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12058151788195465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10823810496745156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841348175894071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10998229785426797,0.10244219404481868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229559639856808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2540965149890865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12924117238056446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06682097185439112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05940121009141972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122150367694479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08429303637588086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11634222763353542,0.0,0.12222840127142665,0.0,0.1293226179071844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968890049016382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10057792715948864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08605982253090988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11459419955652675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193052809537732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16509902657066605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6300721787716099,0.0,0.0,0.1434301891672248,0.096510009375152,0.0,0.0,0.21864242201552864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318557895033923,0.2655500996485781,0.0,0.0,0.17274366825553314,0.0,0.0,0.07829796712399748

I’m scared to ask for help from my family, they’re all in the healthcare industry and I know they won’t understand not to mention it would break my mother’s heart and she’d blame herself (she’s the only one in my family that really even gives a damn about me, and
That’s not an exaggeration) my best and really only friend knows and he’s been very supportive and doesn’t judge me, but he vocalizes the fact that I need to quit snorting anything I can find. It’s gotten to the point where I thought it was impossible to overdose (I’ve tried a bunch) because I thought it would be easier to die than to get sober, when I told my friend that he started to cry, and told me he’d do whatever he could to help me and that I think struck a chord with me. I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember and didn’t think if I ended my life that anyone would care, when he showed me that he does and would care it made me think that I might not be completely useless and a waste of life. That plus a couple of other factors have been what I need to shift my thinking

I guess this rambling paragraph is for me to put my feelings into words... I have snorted painkillers (my main addiction) since I was 14 years old. I’m terrified to quit because I don’t think I even will be able to recognize myself not being high everywhere I go. I’m scared that friends and family will say I’ve changed when I get sober and no longer remain in my life. I’m to scared to ask for help, in fact I’m terrified. But it’s killing me, I think literally at this point.... I’ve puked blood twice today and that coupled with waking up and being disgusted with myself was the driving factor of my decisions get sober. I know it is going to be hell, and that I’m having to rewire my brain after 15 years and that scares me.... but with all of this being said I’m going to try and get sober, I need to and have to get sober. 

I’m sorry that this post was long and if you’ve read up to this point I appreciate you, is there any tips, hints, hacks, or advice you could give me? also be gentle if you have criticism I’m not in a great place mentally and it took a lot to post this mostly anonymous novel length post... wish me luck as I literally restart my life and try and become sober",4.508815840061517,4.716099837370244,5.513535178777392,84.12996059207998,69.65743944636678,9.398000768935026,27.820261437908503,9.372597083632963,2.059333179546329,2198,68,480,43,36,727,234,578,0.14,0.7559999999999999,0.104,-0.98,1,0,5,0,0,0,57.0,1,4,1,3,15,21,4,4,16,0,49,16,4,1,5,95,107,44,2,14,14,2,1,1,4,10,12,2,0,1,35,35,1,0,22,3,0,6,13,10,0,3,20,5,73,11,66,63,9,51,1,2,0,0,36,20,2,10,22,305,108,1,0.06228937167147348,0.0,0.0,0.2037138281354602,0.0,0.06086845308726758,0.0,0.0665683949092402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0498127880211472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04235890873017127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043554176972723915,0.0,0.05125884548719335,0.0,0.11646430813146925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391306846565465,0.06879371718375399,0.0,0.0,0.0653688526203717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06953553911740737,0.0,0.0,0.12701633157614206,0.0,0.19768168785744408,0.0,0.13061844218530105,0.0,0.0,0.09946598949473688,0.1378440099834025,0.06842194989755225,0.0,0.0,0.05364974454712969,0.0,0.06464653357147893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05450984891037475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14447179114445866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055169894835901234,0.0,0.0,0.08228308504790546,0.0,0.0,0.05952016398447271,0.0,0.0,0.23488350399900595,0.0,0.03149537790330409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056931357240612025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19249845615165287,0.0,0.16271812899669202,0.17926092352897166,0.10620145614009556,0.0,0.0,0.06867425216859896,0.06861876546198482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07381320534232748,0.12525375848335735,0.06581214109472842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06891396081627721,0.0,0.10269782898852403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26398095196279125,0.030431440640987562,0.0,0.0,0.11024826759407738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052956196306076515,0.0,0.05893970956954735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06277303602827318,0.0660791798356512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18474711931454,0.04804140345099794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.065362217369071,0.0,0.04220889030619991,0.0947477480454858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054388676730462666,0.06507913577974055,0.0,0.176650769801251,0.0,0.1789679990657905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06261802296972915,0.0,0.13250482824584953,0.062306228060076636,0.0,0.07980833300652887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07056171551646462,0.0,0.059251456582157074,0.0495350084654686,0.2494501100475641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051526411927248925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06972785188024401,0.04408873787070545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068524081033785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394750853949293,0.0,0.14835240995044907,0.03632143353949403,0.0,0.11808608207899635,0.1190403279689454,0.0692057838502228,0.12687118374956588,0.0677529495352146,0.0,0.06484543266268164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05139525509969521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162970334796467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.176994329864133,0.0,0.0,0.12033693935747446

addiction,kimsgrim,2019/01/15,"Delirium Tremens - My story. ""Delirium Tremens (DTs) is a rapid onset of confusion usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol. When it occurs, it is often three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts for two to three days.""  That is the first definition of Delirium Tremens when you Google it. 

I, at the age of 33 am experiencing something someone who drank for 40 years experiences. There are not many personal accounts with clarity (Not saying mine is either,) as usually people who experience DTs have destroyed their minds with alcohol.   
 

I made a video describing my experience  trying to get through withdrawal at home.  My intensive case manager, a woman I've been working with weekly for almost 4 years, followed my trail of delusion and chaos after I told her what happened. She was able to confirm what I had done and it took almost a month for my mind to stabilize again. 

As a result of this incident, I sometimes question my memories, if they actually happened or not because I had experienced a state of consciousness that was completely fictional but was embedded in my memory as real.

addiction,psilocybin1,2019/01/15,"Am I overreacting I met this dealer yesterday in my new car. He came up to the car in a hoodie and made me drive him to a different gas station than the one I had just gone in. Not wanting to be seen on camera I guess? Very sketchy. My question is, if he took a picture of my license plate(I didn't see him do it but he could have) and he knows basically the neighborhood I live in and if one of his boys drives through there he WILL see the car sitting outside MY house.

addiction,Bblacob,2019/01/15,"Anyone have success weaning themselves off opiates? I am currently receiving IV fusion therapy to treat my depression while also trying to kick a heroin addiction (smoking only). I have read over and over again that cold turkey doesn’t work. I don’t know exactly what to believe, over the last week, I have reduced the amount that I have used daily. And I have put days in between use. One day I have had none, 36 hours later I had half a gram. Then another day of no use and today after another 36 hours only .2-.3 G. I have emotional support from my family. I am trying also to get into an inpatient program to get myself out of this mess. 

Has anyone had success weaning themselves off opiates and what did that schedule of reducing the amount look like and over what period? I am not arrogant enough to think that I will surely be able to do this without a program or help externally, but at the very least what can I do to make detox less miserable by reducing dosages before I am able to get into rehab?

addiction,MediocreHoneydew,2019/01/15,"Need advice/motivation from people who have beaten addiction Hey guys, apologies for the long post. I'm hoping someone can share some wisdom with me.

I think I've become addicted to adderall. The long and short of it is that I had a prescription for it for a brief time due to my adhd, and it made a huge difference in my life, but then I lost my medical insurance and could no longer see the doctor who prescribed it for me. My S/O has a much stronger prescription and would usually give me one if I asked, to handle my adhd symptoms for a really difficult day or major project, but taking sporadic, super strong doses started to have an impact on me and gave me a high instead of making me feel normal like my daily minor doses used to do. I got really hooked on it, needing it more than I used to, crashing much harder, craving it more and feeling like I couldn't function without bigger and bigger doses more and more often. Eventually I resorted to taking extremely expired adderall, stealing pills, going through shady channels to get more of it, and snorting it instead of taking it orally.

I know it's wrecking me and I know I need to stop, but (and I hate saying this but I need to be honest) it's hard to quit because I don't *want* to quit. I still struggle with the original symptoms I was medicating in the first place, and the super high and ultra-productivity of these massive dosages is really alluring, especially now that I crash so hard I need uppers just to recover from it. I tell myself it's minor, and not as bad as other drugs, which lets me make excuses for myself and ignore what is clearly a growing problem. I hate feeling useless, and riding high on adderall beats out my adhd, my depression, how paralyzed and worthless I feel in my life. But I see myself going down a bad path with this and I really need to get on track before I start to spiral any further out of control. I'm so ashamed of myself and I just feel really weak and shitty and lost.

**Guys, how do you stay motivated when you're trying to quit?** And when I am able to obtain good medical insurance again and try to handle my mental illness responsibly, how do I keep myself from abusing it again? How do I walk back my tolerance to the point that actual medication will do what it's meant to do?  


I would really appreciate any advice you can give me.

addiction,someone_I_was,2019/01/15,"My Daily Journal to Sobriety from Stimulants I'm creating this post for two reasons:

1. I need to quit stimulants and I've realized that it's going to take a lot more effort than I expected to quit successfully.
2. I hope that I can help or motivate some of you out there who are also struggling to quit stimulants such as ADHD meds, cocaine, meth, cathinones and so forth.

Some quick background about me:

I'm a 30 year old female with an excellent job and strong academic background. No one would ever suspect that I was addicted to anything - it's always been my little secret. I started prescription amphetamines about 5 years ago and have since moved over to things like cocaine and cathinones. I suffer from depression, anxiety, insomnia and ADHD and I'm on antidepressants and some anti-anxiety meds for all of this. I am generally happy but I've used stimulants to get myself through a lot of what life has thrown at me. Again, I don't look like an addict and no one would ever suspect me of being one. It's a pretty lonely place.

This is my first post **and today is the day I decide to quit for good**. I will post here every single day for at least 1 month about how things are going, how I'm feeling, what I'm getting up to and such. I hope to provide some insight into this process, and I also help that this daily journal will motivate me to stay away from what I know is bad for me.

I have been trying to quit for months now but I keep relapsing every 6 - 7 days. It also seems like alcohol is, by far, the most dangerous trigger. I know my dealer's number off by heart so forgetting about the supply chain has been very difficult.

Today is the day I quit. Tomorrow is going to be hell (because I'm currently still high and will struggle to sleep tonight. Tomorrow is a packed day at work, full of meetings).

I'll let you know how it goes.",3.185676652892564,5.239938424242428,4.599902720385675,82.28803589876034,75.22589531680441,7.843285123966941,26.49526515151515,8.660442795831766,2.1087273415977967,1460,55,275,30,32,485,191,363,0.113,0.773,0.114,-0.5543,2,2,4,0,0,0,44.0,0,2,0,14,22,19,2,2,11,0,28,7,2,12,3,61,52,25,0,6,3,0,1,3,0,5,5,0,0,0,20,16,1,1,14,0,0,4,3,9,0,5,4,2,30,10,49,40,12,48,1,3,1,0,7,15,1,11,28,191,50,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17362501836673788,0.1914085125363933,0.0,0.07059048796019984,0.08510422852401263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19104917134999744,0.06626163436798198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218391556726124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06553176633095638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07481850132591775,0.0,0.06649082990098575,0.04854397658122943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2567858073478366,0.0,0.06858840635137581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14406651772102086,0.13418968735581302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04026520155980011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06773640155485677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321066388345219,0.0,0.13577303471493232,0.0667929861434543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847715757277139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436634162665294,0.10675360782437904,0.08413739737929121,0.0,0.1581885044591507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07902417941981485,0.07078210928834608,0.0,0.0,0.1312938297382041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08143087405412214,0.056247651488012015,0.11671503941877558,0.0798139079733189,0.0,0.0,0.06687226853883296,0.0,0.0,0.13540348203796726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769102215756101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12712575111504928,0.08463804173969577,0.0,0.05904739434807672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835621933110704,0.0,0.1618856088356067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08320028823130746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22880127291256255,0.08101612208361864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082015811983108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08187672714188376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07249554785866902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658738360998143,0.0,0.07969123052463613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05636515689163747,0.08487894992111754,0.0635955916626012,0.0,0.0,0.16650090896587794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059874646904590476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10581021016908654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15096691047542818,0.0,0.0,0.054066068588334966,0.0,0.07779057321223858,0.0,0.0,0.06877796584804355,0.0,0.06570615892148013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0579742965962471,0.0,0.0,0.11313901977619105,0.0,0.0,0.10256300957755952
addiction,xXaroundtheworldXx,2019/01/15,"Life without cannabis still isn't worth it (2 years later) Hello,

A quick preface: I was an almost daily smoker. I would take one or two day breaks here and there and sometimes longer breaks, mostly because of piss tests. All of my friends, in a way or another, smoked cannabis.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of work and hair follicle testing it's been more than two years since I last smoked with the exception of a trip of 2 days to Spain last August.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very confused. 

I now realize that for some neurological quirk, cannabis is something I need to live a decent life.

The thing I miss the most is hanging out with my friends and smoking or ingesting cannabis.

All the interesting people for some reason seem to be into it.

Or just knowing that by lighting up I'd have the power of changing my mind.

I miss that feeling of control over my mood, especially since I'm a rather depressive person.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried meditation, 2 psychologists, 2 psychiatrists, psychedelics, fitness and all sorts of coping mechanism.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's anedonia but I don't know how that could be reliably diagnosed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just writing this to point out how for some people sobriety can be simply a bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I only want to be sober enough to work enough to get enough money to be able to be high.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything else doesn't matter.

addiction,Mf136201,2019/01/15,"Made it to 9:00 AM before I got high. Big day. For the past several months I have been waking up at six almost everyday, and getting high. A week and a half or so ago I decided to wait longer each day, in 15 minute increments, until I stopped altogether. I decided to do this because I 1) wanted to quit badly, and 2) needed a way to stay productive at work despite withdrawal symptoms (opiate withdrawals). It is working so far. Most days I wait an extra ten or fifteen minutes to reassure myself that I can do it again the day after. Today was definitely the worst. Bad stomach aches, that crawly leg feeling, and just general anxiety up until I finally gave in a few minutes ago. Also when I finally did ingest drugs, I had an even worse stomach ache until they actually took hold. Not sure why this is, but it sucks. I really think that I can keep this going. Last night I was thinking about how much I miss being sober, and how much better of a person I am when I am sober. I’ll get to noon in another week or so, and I can’t wait.

addiction,SoulessZombie,2019/01/15,"Coping w/a partner going through porn addiction? My bf has recently admitted to me about his addiction to porn and how he hates that he has no will power to stop and wants to stop watching porn completely as it makes him feel weak, lazy, and insensitive or not compassionate. I read that decade long addictions to porn roots to childhood upbringing and how it’s a way to cope with emptiness or conceal it. I could not help but react bitterly towards him at first when all he was asking for was my support because I felt like a betrayal that he beats off to porn right after we just had sex. And for 2 hours!  He wants to stop fapping and I haven’t been much help because we tend to keep having sex when I should be more compassionate and not angry and stern with committing to not having sex. 

I really need some great advice or ways to cope with this problem.  I know everyone has there own opinions on porn whether they accept it into their relationship or not but I clearly do not. It is not a religious thing and I am not against porn or what they do but I do not welcome it in my relationship. I feel as if a good relationship should have intimacy and compassion and porn makes it very difficult for that to happen when you get a person who has been watching it consistently for over a decade who has trouble showing love or affection to me. 
I have read few articles on how it’s like for a person to be addicted to porn and how it’s hard to deal with a decade long habit but there is hope and people do come out of it. 

Is this considered cheating for some people? 
How do I react when he has told me in the past he does it because he likes “variety”
I’m glad he at least wants to quit so there’s that. I need this addiction to be gone in order for me to stay in the relationship and I’m willing to do what I can and wait how long and support him. 

I know love heals and I’m hoping this love we have will conquer!

addiction,waterfa112,2019/01/15,"Meth, how hard is it to quit. Hello. I currently found out a sibling has been using meth for the past year and a half. He was confronted and he broke down and promise us he would seek help and stop. That was more than a month ago. The issue was brought up again and he said h wasn’t willing to go anywhere to seek help he wanted to use less and less little by little until he was no longer using. I highly doubt that is gonna happen. My question is for those who have tried to stop using/ have stopped.... with experience how hard is it to quit using meth without going to a place to detox and then continuing treatment?? It’s fairly obvious my brother isn’t going to get help himself and unfortunately my parents can’t force him to go anywhere either.

addiction,paganwidow,2019/01/15,"My husband died of an overdose, I miss him so much and I'm so angry. He had been clean for quite awhile, things were going well, he had lined up a bunch of work, he was so happy. The last text he sent me was ""I'm gonna make you so proud, this is the start of our new lives"". Then after work that day, he bought a bag of heroin, came home, played around with me, and later I went to bed...and I found him dead the next morning.

addiction,RLJ05,2019/01/15,"Is anyone else addicted to diet coke? Considering the other addictions I have or have had in the past, this feels like it should be minor, however I'm finding it impossible to stop. The craving I have for diet coke, especially around meal times, is extreme. Currently I drink about 5 cans a day, it's been between 3 - 8 for the last 15 years. 

The best I've managed is around 10 days clean in 2016. Since then my max is about 2/3 days.

Any tips if anyone has overcome this would be much appreciated!",4.48424153166421,5.765286525773195,5.628718703976437,79.38855670103094,70.34020618556701,8.841826215022092,28.290132547864513,9.23628265651192,2.313976141384389,391,14,77,8,7,130,71,97,0.023,0.8440000000000001,0.134,0.8955,2,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,4,2,0,0,6,0,15,8,0,0,0,9,17,3,0,3,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,6,2,6,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,4,2,11,11,2,14,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,11,47,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4405544551796939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137408978038678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2825726689637275,0.20703623039343508,0.0,0.3597557487481368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21205143152633613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3909395057861424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19794367434675406,0.0,0.0,0.16879673666121356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102168535979125,0.14435301660379632,0.0,0.0,0.18468085820198035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16470736584893772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09871720693655096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.148538699601516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19289088702574814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16714763947353928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16893274331834235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11782388199266194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435389314453005,0.0,0.0,0.1301211980596907

addiction,3Karma_3_Vixen3,2019/01/15,"I know I need it I've numbed myself for the past 15 years &amp; didn't even realize it until reading another redditors post saying the same thing. I couldn't  even offer advice because I'm in the same hole ridden boat. I started drinking at 15 (weekly then almost daily), moved onto pills when I was 19 &amp; have been addicted since. I started taking pain medication for a medical condition I'll have forever. My proneness to addiction has ruined EVERY good thing in my life. Every relationship, several jobs, school. I have a young child, I'm 30 &amp; I KNOW I need help but I'm absolutely terrified to seek it. As I type I want to take my life &amp; end this, but my child is what's stopping me from hanging myself on a tree outside. I've been in the hospital for suicide attempts twice &amp; just thinking about going back is scary. I don't know what to do. I've been without the pills for over a week but yesterday brought 2 pills. I felt great until the last one wore off now I'm back at square one. I need a hug &amp; a redo. Withdrawal is SO PAINFUL &amp; I have no idea who I am without pills.

addiction,the_normster,2019/01/15,"Do you know at least 1 person addicted to... In a world with many epidemics... I truly believe addiction to heroin to be among one of the worst in 2019.

Curious how many people know at least 1 person (family or friend) that has been a heroin addict/user/fatality.

My number is 3.

addiction,Gienixo,2019/01/15,"Needed Advice Hello! I'm going to start with letting you know that this is my first post ever on Reddit, so any help is greatly appreciated. Recently my family and I have gone through a very long month. My brother was just put in detox for smoking Crack.(Keep in mind I have never done any drugs so input is very needed for I can only sympathize) Looking back on all the events leading up makes me think of how I could have been there for him more after he was diagnosed with Depression. He started to ignore us and not respond around the 24th of December. Concerned as we are we keep at it until the 28th I go over to his house to him answering saying everything is fine and no need for concern. Should have known in that moment it was not. Something isn't sitting right. We wait another week of no answered messages or calls. Finally his best friend  calls us asking if we have heard from him, bless the man for being the best thing that could happen to my brother. My brother is now in contact with my sister to tell her he is going to the hospital since he admitted he has stopped taking his depression meds and been staring at a noose for 5 days. His stories he tells us are spotty at best and hard to make out the truth, but all I can surcome of this situation is his new ""friend"" which he himself has said several times is a bad influence and they shouldn't hang out but still talks to even going into Detox as of today. I would do absolutely anything and everything to help my brother recover, my point of this story is to lay everything out and ask advice on how to help, what to do and what exactly not to say. I have for a week non stop read all there is to know about his addiction and stories to gain the basic knowledge but I have always been the type to want to hear the hard truth.",6.324802816901407,6.101399867605637,6.655880281690142,78.95790492957751,65.8169014084507,9.804225352112676,31.834507042253517,9.3871,2.6762084507042254,1423,50,277,24,20,461,193,355,0.058,0.841,0.101,0.9443,0,0,2,0,0,0,24.0,7,1,1,6,14,14,0,0,14,0,40,5,0,6,8,68,68,22,0,10,9,5,2,0,2,3,5,5,0,1,12,22,0,5,8,1,0,8,8,4,0,1,10,9,38,10,58,51,7,53,1,2,2,0,55,19,0,2,24,203,50,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950800654531795,0.0,0.17045607232090842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07257203589674982,0.0,0.0,0.11862192718439855,0.09145526560281557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177265915501786,0.07764216145352251,0.16307337810277725,0.0,0.0,0.06706495617612905,0.07282305877910364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745884930035376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1781178565591996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13927232448701854,0.0,0.0,0.05624814119474196,0.0,0.15024079424874906,0.08852403520822319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925389328695545,0.0,0.0,0.1011447343845933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057606406867300175,0.07889331885104907,0.0,0.0,0.2351566840951148,0.0,0.08222099772940084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09554262532651778,0.0,0.07418725197534602,0.0,0.0,0.13476821366071925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19827110399808096,0.0,0.0,0.09615771964380387,0.0,0.0,0.07712624184645574,0.0,0.15625968921051095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830058189317234,0.0,0.17538037055003455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006374084400161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15504603305117556,0.0,0.0,0.09586503176048856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918591235073765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718483763390532,0.07324082358044441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643685988218855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687909959621292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806492014439568,0.0,0.06961626181817054,0.0,0.0,0.1940122514232216,0.06726759532808141,0.08423530834639566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06633292031395019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244882985503052,0.0,0.08353035835095539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767778471893811,0.0,0.0,0.08724120934225799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08611686492089081,0.0,0.0,0.07448335984543783,0.08296391690624381,0.1387178835200749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985310704267976,0.0,0.0721473058081156,0.09803624456399866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06714437495008523,0.0,0.0,0.12346614230941524,0.0,0.06965209362906179,0.1458356496278465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06557678611327462,0.07010220877774988,0.15246406561274092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057943502630717375,0.05588552088524669,0.0,0.0,0.050857288038277236,0.0,0.08267209336703432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31473612726994965,0.0,0.0,0.14392731991504693,0.05144320435016733,0.0,0.13992140693159802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061956885631003225,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,jhrepairtech,2019/01/15,"Thank you god I don't even know what to say. What's going on in my life man. I came to Florida three years ago to get sober and I just kept messing it up again and again and again. I made my life miserable for years, I just couldn't get out of my own way to save my own life. God? What did god ever do for me? Why would I get on my knees and pray? That's so lame...

But man its not...Its really not, I feel so surreal right now, 27 and the first time in my life, I feel good. Things are going really well and I'm not used to it, I don't even know how to react when things are going well. People in my life trust me, I'm visiting my parents in February for the first time in three years, and a dude asked me to sponsor him tonight. I almost laughed out loud, like nah dude. I got nothin to offer. But I didn't, I gave him my number and hopefully he calls me but even if he doesn't man it just feels surreal to think that anyone would ever seek advise from this dumb gutter drunk, drug addict from Maryland. Holy crap man, gods good dude. Gods real fuckin good.

addiction,plantlover26,2019/01/15,Xanax need vs addiction I’ve taken Xanax recreationally before in college but then quit for a couple years. Recently I found a plug and started taking them to do things like go to the grocery store or the gym because being around a lot of people gives me anxiety. Now I fear I may have become dependent. Today is my first day without any and I feel anxious. Could I be addicted? Should I just quit cold turkey or see a psychiatrist about getting a prescription? I really don’t lol being dependent on drugs but I already take Wellbutrin everyday.,3.9414705882352976,6.604899813725492,5.162509803921568,76.21729411764707,75.37254901960785,8.393725490196081,28.82745098039216,9.120678840339163,3.0249498039215688,439,19,72,11,10,145,80,102,0.093,0.8320000000000001,0.075,-0.2126,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,1,3,4,2,0,1,7,1,10,5,0,2,0,19,21,7,0,3,7,0,1,1,0,2,5,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,0,1,2,3,11,1,9,13,1,13,0,0,1,0,2,3,0,6,10,49,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3740656835795799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1893279320448593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166711236163631,0.0,0.13124792579479372,0.19382134434466392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527305858503529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10458536421965002,0.1894817530050764,0.14599048049461388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13698191364994353,0.1898351021150553,0.0,0.11064621845707977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19896270594533302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19306004450079686,0.0867491925277841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459344027098603,0.0,0.18811384460659986,0.0,0.0,0.08963643073870857,0.16458224881617484,0.097505212708917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381874036145218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14585972846552278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12721440802817946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1189426296096443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649642462348195,0.0,0.0,0.10990991228237612,0.0,0.16940125036107734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13671631155714356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12143567292937925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2579933575718178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11398117900553925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16262500962161686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16538401248232104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11048322024240782

addiction,ole_gizzard_neck,2019/01/16,"Introduction I had a rough 2018 not only because I was using, but because it went so well and I don't know what to think now. Lemme explain.

I had a brief stint 6-9 mos of intermittent use about 6 years ago and went to rehab. Rehab was revelatory and like a lot of people, when I got out, I was ready to hit the ground running. Thing is I hated 12 step groups and socializing I found out was tough, so I isolated, from basically everyone. I was shit at going out with my wife because I didn't have my social lubricant, but talking with my wife was tough as she was still very resentful, didn't want to talk about it, and really didn't understand. I still went to meetings and went through some considerable growth, but my life partner, my wife was still in the same rut. And who could blame her. She had spent a decade being manipulated by me and was used to this dynamic and now I have made some leaps in my understanding of toxic dynamics and helping myself and my wife was left in the dust (she has her own issues but addiction isn't one of them). No matter how much I worked at things with her to help her along, it wasn't happening and add to that a new baby and it was tough. So all at the same time, I'm sober and we have new kid. This really changed our social dynamic and this was received poorly, gas on the resentment fire.

I relapsed about a year in and the wife never found out. Nothing much, just a taste. That first relapse is bitter, I tried to induce vomiting but it didn't happen. It was after a string of 3 funerals of family members and I had open access to my mothers opiates (and she knows about everything that went on and still left them out!). Not her problem, but REALLY?! Any who, i made it another year and a half after that before using again and I just did it from time to time to scratch an itch but never went full bore.

Work was going well, the marriage was sucking ass. I got preoccupied with the Kratom idea and dove in using it constantly for about 4 months before I was done and then moved to marijuana. During that Kratom run I got some Dilaudid (that and marijuana were my DOCs) and that really got my juices flowing. Then I found an old stash of my mother's opanas, almost 200, and I went to town on those. This spurred two more dilaudid binges, small ones, but during the last one, I really didn't want it anymore. I realized what I had to lose and I stopped.

During those last binges, I got two promotions, some work awards, and nobody was the wiser. Not good for my ego. I was also closer with my wife during this time. I also have a healthy shopping addiction. However, my fellowship with others suffered still. This is going to be a mind fuck later on when I am struggling, but I wanted to get it out there to people.

My relationship with my wife is tenuous, but there's a lot of love there but also a lot of pain, but we have an amazing girl that has been a springboard for a lot of other positives. Work is fine, but what I am working on is outreach and fellowship and not hiding or lurking. I haven't shopped in two weeks, used other drugs in a week and that is tough but is worth it, I know it and felt it before. Thanks for reading if you  make it this far and I hope to be contributing more.

Thanks.",4.552383720930231,5.2652589598765465,5.4378265862761985,82.91696382428944,69.74074074074075,8.805684754521963,26.798162503588863,8.973190933345348,1.87037499282228,2538,76,523,45,43,832,280,648,0.12,0.752,0.128,0.6596,1,0,1,0,0,0,77.0,3,1,2,9,29,31,7,1,29,0,57,14,3,12,3,122,108,61,1,7,22,9,4,1,1,0,9,0,0,3,43,51,1,1,15,3,5,18,16,17,2,8,52,6,70,14,74,51,17,84,0,2,0,3,43,30,4,12,37,380,113,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283807668263813,0.0,0.0,0.05219559404645702,0.0,0.05896210419557967,0.0,0.0,0.14126442922903182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04004197384007743,0.0617432112211867,0.0,0.0,0.05839540586209896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10768228559900983,0.0,0.1503134662546217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06228965138732871,0.0,0.0,0.06363083316920917,0.0,0.047012714311131486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06025702237269639,0.0,0.0,0.0682847582132713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056264547899596916,0.052919602170001794,0.0,0.05550897912942936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056536228818543074,0.0,0.0,0.050085242642301964,0.0,0.19368416308722608,0.0,0.05443572486299472,0.030763564312274214,0.0,0.10039248073241484,0.04938766809290235,0.23546771674574574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041388226174577,0.0,0.0,0.05813406727870156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893511063611851,0.0,0.0,0.058483396277280886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06647093405027504,0.0,0.06145780879348856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708049392835713,0.09599384448860107,0.0,0.0,0.1279515526930254,0.0,0.04159030016608144,0.028766910824460375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587421685832325,0.0,0.20023845662931905,0.053143562298975135,0.11143168601246607,0.039304383330205764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05945432370473552,0.0,0.046999279150706536,0.06258255177415746,0.08657051101870268,0.0,0.0908272983366674,0.11373775804447896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05649914176387564,0.0,0.06178705439967111,0.0,0.11970048323665028,0.04478263206461328,0.0626549041274986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08164312669105776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0563423957576315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05889822067768365,0.0,0.18860750183770708,0.0,0.0,0.06321753940009484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060441820720391275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18006922696906386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23511734948176874,0.049228227916676096,0.0,0.06155655035030345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465470260474723,0.0,0.10842179627113496,0.0,0.0,0.07823754921583495,0.03772939149517485,0.0,0.0,0.13733893862913504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03997720725936521,0.0,0.17255831333747748,0.12259707325642913,0.0,0.3051323390853696,0.0,0.04858405284506916,0.10419089413226523,0.0,0.09446363668181512,0.0,0.10588449371460304,0.3820912851814464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21433502853619046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137547855267303
addiction,TriggerPig,2019/01/16,"A Rough Patch So I have been clean from an 11 year heroin habit 4 and a half months.  I am working, seeing my Suboxone doctor, just going ng about my day.  Well, recently I started seeing this girl, we went on two dates and it seemed like it was going very well, she would kiss me and touch me and throw me all sorts of signals that it was going well. 

 But it seems like she isn't really interested in going forward with things, and I can't help but to feel a bit hurt by this.  That sense of rejection, like I can't do the things ""normal"" people do or I don't fit in with people all those emotions come up because of this.  At times when I am at my job I feel like I should take the elevator to the top floor and just stand on the ledge until the cops come to throw me in for a psych eval, I am not suicidal I just feel like I need to talk to someone.

Today on my way back from filling my sub prescription I saw someone selling oxy 30s to someone else in a gas station and I was so tempted to buy some, infact I think the only reason I didn't was I didn't have the money.  I wanted to take a bus down to my old spot and buy a few bags of heroin but there is so much fentanyl on the market.

I am not scared of an overdose I just greatly prefer heroin to fentanyl.

  I just feel super depressed all the time and while it's totally not that girls fault at all I think it has to do with me dating and it not going as well as I'd hoped.  But really it started before then, I have just been super depressed for a while.

It truly wants me to lose it all. When I’m on it, I become a completely different human being. I lose empathy and compassion for others, just want the drug and sex.

addiction,rikkuuc,2019/01/16,"Opioid addicts try avoiding Tianeptine if you are getting prescribed Antidepressants. Im an addict and hoped to find craving relief with this. Since im also an idiot I was curios and well did ca 125mg and it's 100% more addictive than Tramadol Codein Kratom or even Tilidin. I never did an high potent opioid cuz im afraid the cravings increase. Well suddenly the tingling and euphoria creeped up and even sedation set in. 

Comparable to the Level of sedation you get from codeine but the euphoria is the most Ive had from any opioid of those listend above.

I called my doc and directly told him it's too addictive to treat my depression, social anxiety, adhd (it helped a lot with that). It's sad that I cant handle addicting meds besides Benzodiazepines which I have no problems with if I need them.

It's like the Cocain version of opioids it's so short you try to maintain this Level every 30mins (only if abused)

At least im brave enough to cut supply from my doc.

Im clean tho. I didnt took an Opioid for over a month now and only did the tharapeutic dose of 25mg - 12,5mg - 0mg a day. Sobriety is really hard. I cant trust myself with opioids. Only Kratom didnt have this effect where I wanted more n more.

Also People say it's similar to DHC and try to dose the same dont do the same as a DHC dose. The effects are more intense and potent and I consumed manly DHC so my tolerance from DHC didnt do a shit to Tianeptine.

Be careful and good luck with your battle ❤️",2.245235109717868,4.473251723905727,3.938818065714617,85.06424242424242,78.89898989898991,6.65547428306049,24.71949378845931,7.753152298057669,1.4757761291071634,1170,43,225,19,29,391,165,297,0.107,0.732,0.162,0.9469,0,1,6,0,1,0,26.0,0,4,1,2,12,20,4,2,19,0,21,10,1,3,1,37,29,23,0,7,5,0,1,1,0,0,9,1,1,1,14,16,0,1,4,0,0,2,8,9,2,0,10,2,22,11,28,18,12,17,0,2,0,0,12,9,1,8,6,144,36,0,0.0,0.11633298488279513,0.0,0.5351798631540723,0.11799910232910996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15703676861103513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06676906084891197,0.0,0.0751111369468033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100257703488425,0.0,0.10010599217552972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06332110177626364,0.0,0.08456646229992247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11507190597222546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014511903564452,0.0,0.12970032697009912,0.0,0.08272496578123306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08973916868406066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10259505716173163,0.0,0.0,0.08235278883231217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08795433479098705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06581123131227244,0.10373767845018173,0.0,0.09751970420550198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5302824008347168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04796815528986683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08347324327949121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906122753969386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837020577461264,0.0,0.0,0.07280281775995984,0.07572620462722297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2240219948126427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0680690082324888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939496355933762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289972525859272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808052883162342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10078533145285702,0.08121951760400503,0.0,0.0,0.10008708378972953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938198260991982,0.109086974417282,0.1999831922420256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057911964896336474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1765599326352513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,ScoobyDooBoxlogo,2019/01/16,"Addictive Personality Honestly I haven't realized that I could get hooked on something that I didn't really enjoy. For example eating multiple bags of Hot cheetos and playing games. I was a big extrovert, but nowadays I feel a bit depressed for what i've been doing with my life so far. I want to do more with my life like go outside, enjoy nature and get fit before prom. I always think of what would be the best thing to do, but in the end it's all talk and I just go back to doing what I usually do ""eating junkfood and games."" And by the time i'm about to sleep I would wonder what I could have done that day and just postpone it until the next day. And the new day would repeat as the day before. I've learned that my dad has an addictive personality and I probably got it from him. This makes me scared of losing who I was back, and especially who I can become. Sometimes I try and behave like I used to and it'll work for a while, but I just start to revert back to my old ways. I also learned that I start to give up most of the time on anything and revert back as well when i dont feel or see change in my life. I'm not sure of what I should do and i've been keeping it in for a while. Anyway thanks for hearing my story.",2.8209898785425125,3.769882503846155,4.451457489878543,87.52091093117409,73.96153846153847,7.473684210526315,23.684210526315788,7.85451343220497,0.9860384615384621,961,26,214,13,19,324,134,260,0.086,0.809,0.106,0.6292,0,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,3,13,13,0,1,12,0,25,8,1,2,2,43,46,25,0,7,8,1,3,2,0,5,5,1,0,2,19,15,2,1,7,3,0,2,4,3,1,0,7,5,29,10,32,31,5,34,0,2,1,0,11,9,0,3,24,152,48,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2374536314159467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08709443670197699,0.0906209591926371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962277461372989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3349769966789739,0.0,0.0,0.1202813631754672,0.18534696587975066,0.0,0.11429320909339273,0.0,0.1189003508499861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11521121338648325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1739098466516502,0.0,0.0,0.28094901540986994,0.0,0.09380310691611056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145165381399218,0.1276404617787018,0.0,0.0,0.2228820611694807,0.0,0.0,0.09646099133419812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11013526069007164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11380084792804687,0.10447537521759724,0.12379091617363515,0.0,0.08710442507032792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274828603440907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680326630288248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307768067658689,0.10641480976857884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12184124145982354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07269756041372935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051849289593899,0.11582588888850248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142816077858296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901901640516317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11742225315925665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06976985311860635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10903684416647924,0.0,0.08678632143526006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898758864411068,0.0,0.0,0.0838434196750887,0.1077137224123187,0.0,0.1541726107809927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026453832137656,0.0,0.0,0.08753687728976481,0.0,0.10026871581176172,0.0,0.0,0.07235425770399066,0.06978444858301157,0.0,0.0,0.12701135270676114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07394201851467308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09406235291231864,0.11994780636968948,0.0,0.06423731213476659,0.08644684403410863,0.0,0.0,0.09792221282325617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810709525357001,0.07928700244389023,0.0,0.0,0.2320973499678881,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,apatheticpessimist,2019/01/16,"I’m pretty sure I’m addicted to food but since some people think it’s not an addiction I’d like to share my reasons why I feel I’m addicted so I can get feedback. I’m 17F and I’ve always had a bad relationship with food. I never understood why food was somewhere in the back of my mind all the time.

The first time I remember ever “binging”/doing something unusual with food would be when I was about 10ish. I was at home in the kitchen and I started eating spoonfuls of sugar. I don’t know why but I was eating spoonfuls of straight white sugar and I liked it.

Around 13/14 I developed BED/bulimia. Never been diagnosed but I know I have these disorders, there’s no way I don’t. I ate half of a Dairy Queen ice cream sheet cake (11x14 inches) along with other foods I don’t remember and ending up throwing all that up.

Throughout the years I’ve binged, purged, and tried to restrict but ended up binging again. There’s days where I’ll make multiple mug cakes and eat those just because when I’m in a binging trance I’ll eat anything.

When I binge, I need food as fast as possible. It’s like I’m not even myself, it’s like I can’t control my body. My brain is saying, “Stop. You’re so full. You’re in pain from being so full.” But I keep eating, literally anything, even if I don’t want it I just eat it because it’s food.

I find myself thinking of food and my next meal at times that I know isn’t normal. I think about my next meal right when I wake up, before I go to sleep, driving to school, during a test, during class, while eating a meal, at the pool etc...

I think the worst part of a food addiction is that I need it to survive. 

Imagine being an alcoholic and trying to get clean except you have to drink a sip of alcohol once a day. Not enough to satisfy you so you’re constantly craving more. You know that tomorrow you’ll get another sip, but it’ll be just as unsatisfying and tempting.

That’s how it is with food. I try to not binge, I try to not think about it but I know that I need to eat the next day, and the next, and the next in order to survive.

It seems as though the thing that is keeping me alive is also killing me at the same time.

tl:dr I’m pretty sure I have food addiction. I always think about it and find myself binging, even on foods I don’t want. Does all this sound like addiction?

addiction,notworthausername,2019/01/17,"Feeling fake either way I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I didn't want to post in AA or stopdrinking because I didn't think it quite fit either, and I apologize in advance if it isn't.


I got sober for nine months in 2013 from alcohol. I dabbled in coke on and off for a couple years prior to that but never went full-on. Every time I got sober, there would be this point where I'd think ""I'm fake. This sober person who is doing yoga, running, and being responsible isn't me. I don't know how to find myself."" Low and behold, I drank on and off. A year ago almost to the day I started heavily using blow and drinking. Then xanax to help me comedown. 

Fast forward to a shitty night with self-harm la la la whatever on Sep. 6th and I quit drinking and doing coke. Drank on Dec. 27th. Haven't since.

I watched the movie Gia and now I feel fake in the opposite way. I've never done heroin or meth, I don't know if I can call myself an addict, I just want to be sober for the sake of not wanting to be depressed. I hate AA meetings. I don't know how to get through this without feeling fake for being sober, or feeling like a dramatic piece of shit for faking being an addict. 

Just wondering if anyone else has ever felt the same, and maybe has anything to say or recommendations for books to read or movies to watch or something.

addiction,porcelainprin,2019/01/17,"I need help to stay away from ice I need help. I’ve been trying to keep our little boat from sinking for 4 years and it’s getting me down. 
My partner had a small meth habit when I met him. It wasn’t a deal breaker for me, I’d experimented with stuff. And I loved him right away and thought (still do) that we can get through this. 
I started smoking it with him. We had amazing times together. Doing stupid fun things. Meanwhile our finances and lives were falling apart. Going up in smoke, literally. 
Before I knew it, I was a drug addict. 
I became pregnant in aug 2016, so I was a pregnant drug addict. My greatest shame is that I couldn’t stop even then. I hated myself. Still do. 
We got kicked out of our house. Moved into his mums. I stopped smoking. Had a perfect, beautiful baby boy who changed my life. My partner stopped smoking in aug 2017. 
Got well, on meds for depression. Started his business back up and was booked out for months. Life was good. 
Aug 2018 he wanted to try it again, because he thought if he did it would stop his dreams about it. He did it, he was fine. But as you all know, it’s the slipperiest of slopes. Then I had some. Then we were getting more. It’s so much worse when you’ve been on the other side. You know where that road leads. 
We didn’t want to do it in 2019 at all. So we stopped. But his motivation for work is gone. Plus getting a pretty bad chest infection has made it so much harder for him to get going again at work. Clients are trying to reach him but he’s hibernating. I’m stressing because I don’t want to lose all the business we worked so hard getting from these people. He just doesn’t seem to be able to engage. So I stupidly, stupidly got him a tiny bit. My reasoning was that he could at least contact his clients and maybe get the ball rolling again. 
Found out we’ve been blessed with another child (very much wanted). But I feel like a junkie POS that doesn’t deserve it. Realised I’d smoked while pregnant again. 2 for 2, kicking goals. 
I desperately want to be free of this demon. So does he. We’re in line to buy a house in July. We clawed our way back and then some. But this is a major hurdle at the moment. It could ruin everything. 
I need any advice/words of encouragement/success stories that you beautiful people have. I need to not rationalise getting some for him just to get him out of bed. The cycle sucks, I hate dealing with the bad moods when he’s coming down. Sometimes I want to leave but I won’t. I know I’m enabling. But I so badly want to fix this. So does he. We just need to get back on track. 
Sorry for the hugely long post. If you read it, thank you. It’s been cathartic to write it down.

addiction,Bella135,2019/01/17,"Boyfriend has relapsed and gone missing on me...need help/advice Things were going VERY well prior to this. I know that him doing drugs (anxiety pills FYI) is bad...but I miss him and I’m worried about him. He’s super intelligent, funny and a GOOD guy (well he was when he was sober idk).

Anyway, Sunday he completely went missing. I was worried and sent him a few messages and he got back to me on Monday saying he was in withdrawal because his mother confiscated the rest of the Ativan he had (plausible because I know she’s done that in past experiences). I didn’t know he had relapsed. He was saying he was worthless, I needed to stay away and that I didn’t want someone like him. I tried really hard to reassure him and beg him to go to the hospital to no avail.

I haven’t heard from him since. I know he’s alive because I see him active on fb. I don’t think he’s just ghosting me...he hasn’t even deleted the pictures of us or anything. He’s just not opening ANYTHING I send him. I’m terrified and worried for him. I don’t know what this means for us if he ever gets back to me...he’d have to want to get clean. It goes beyond that for me though...I’m scared for him and just want to know if he is alright. I’ve sent a bunch of messages trying to coax him out...nothing. The last one said, “listen it’s okay if you don’t want to talk anymore but can you please just let me know you’re fine? I’m worried about you”. 

I’m devastated. Does anyone have experience with this? The only conclusions I have are: A) he’s messed up on drugs and therefore ignoring everyone B) he’s actually in withdrawal and sick and therefore ignoring everyone or C) he’s embarrassed and doesn’t want to face me+ one of the first two. I say C because he would always tell me how much he respected me and how perfect I am. He would say I was too good all the time...not true btw he’s a really good person beyond this. 

Can I even do anything? I don’t want to keep sending messages...he’s not opening them! I feel wary about just showing up to his house (lives with his mom). I’ve tried to call a couple of times ... does anyone else have any other reason he’s completely shutting me out but not removing me on socials, not deleting our pictures and not even opening them to give me the message that he’s ghosting?

addiction,sda531,2019/01/17,"Substance addiction I think I have a substance problem. Not any particular one just anything to feel different then normal. I’ve never let anything take control of me. I show up for work on time always, keep my bills paid, have had the same job for 2 years, etc. I guess you could say LSD got a hold of me pretty good, I tripped every weekend for a good year and a half but I still held down my job and was a functioning member of society. By that I mean I wasn’t stealing stuff so I could have it and all that, never gotten anything if I didn’t have the money. I can’t seem to not wanna be doing some kind of drug though. Whether it be uppers, downers, psychs, anything to feel other than normal. I used to smoke weed every day but quit 6 weeks ago because I was very lazy. Weed is the only thing I’ve done daily and the rest of my use is only on weekends. It’s not affecting my daily life but I know it’s bad for my health.

If I’m not able to get anything I don’t go crazy or anything but I’m definitely bored out of my mind and wishing I could be messed up. It’s so easy to stay away during the week because work keeps me occupied and I feel just fine. But on the weekend I just get so bored, it’s like if I’m not on a drug I feel empty, lonely, or feel nothing. I’ve tried writing because I have lots of crazy philosophical thoughts but really need to be on something to not get bored with it pretty quick. I have good friends and family but they’re all blind to the fact I’m doing anything because I take good care of my self and can put on a good act around them. My mom knows what I’ve done to an extent but currently thinks I haven’t done anything in months. She’s the one who gave me the idea of writing my thoughts down. She pushes me to go above and beyond to be successful and she’s very proud of me. I don’t wanna have to go to her about this and disappoint her. Which is why I’m posting here. 

Anyways I was hoping someone here has had a similar experience and could give me some advice. Maybe I have mental health issues and should get checked out by a doctor? Maybe I’ve just become a functioning drug addict? What do you all think? Thanks in advance!

addiction,MisterSanitation,2019/01/17,"Not sure if I should be here but here's my concerns... Hi everyone, as I said I dont know if I have an addiction really but here is what is going on. I am 27 and married to a beautiful amazing chick, I have a condo and a great job (I am the only person in my job to have no college experience, because I was a fast learner and I had a recommendation). I am absolutely functioning BUT I feel like I can't be sober whether its marijuana, kratom, or alcohol I HAVE to do something that day. It usually happens around 4 or 5 after work but when I have worked from home and know its light I will have some drinks or kratom and have a hard time saying no the idea once it arrives (usually because a podcast talks about a party or something).

I do not go on binders and will always show up to work, but I am worried I have a fear or discomfort of sobriety. Once I tried to not do any substances and I lasted a week and a half before breaking and I think now if I were to try, it would be less than that. I have tried to only drink on weekends lately and then I said I could do one day a week day which of course quickly collapsed. 

My wife is in her last year prepping to be a Physicians Assistant and she has had mixed feelings. The first time I mentioned my concern she said ""you are young and you don't drink enough to be concerned, I think you're fine"". But as recently as yesterday she said ""I think we should talk about your drinking because you have been drunk every day since Friday"" and it was Wednesday night. 

I know this sub probably has hardcore stuff on here and certainly I am not a hardcore guy but alcoholism has killed a lot of people in my family and I don't want that especially when kids are in my future. I can't see a therapist anymore thanks to my new shitty insurance with my company. Friends around me are amazing and are worried when I make a comment about it, but I don't want our relationship to revolve around my problems instead of our friendship you know? I just brush it off and act like its no big deal because me in a good mood is very similar to me after having a few drinks or smoking. Anyway, sorry for the novel, but any advice or insight would be helpful and I appreciate your comments or thoughts. 

TLDR: Have a lot of addiction in my family and don't spend a lot of time sober, but I am functioning in society well for my age and education level.

addiction,widgetblossom,2019/01/17,"Accepting the possibility of relapse I was 2+ years clean from meth until last month. I used for 1 day and then (somehow) managed to pull myself together enough to put it down again. That was 36 days ago and I have been clean since.

The relapse helped me identify some obvious triggers that were in my life that I have been able to remove. If I relapse again, it is less likely to happen in the exact same way as before. 

There are some other psychological issues that I have started to work on as well in an effort to be proactive about preventing future relapses. 

Still, I am coming to grips with the fact that I am an addict. There are going to be temptations in my life forever. I will have to constantly make the decision to stay clean instead of yielding to temptation. 

I might fail. That failure would likely end up with catastrophic consequences for me and the people in my life. But it might happen.

Learning to live with this Sword of Damocles hanging over my head is difficult. I want to promise people I love that I'm done with drugs and will never slip again. I can't promise that. All I can promise is that I'll try. 

Maybe one day I will be at peace with this constant state of uncertainty. For today, it is the biggest challenge I face.

addiction,LondonLifeCoach,2019/01/17,"Understanding Your ""Strange"" Addiction There are people who are not addicted to classic things, like alcohol, drugs or gambling. And often, people with more unusual addictions can be even more stigmatised. They are given less compassion, or sometimes just not believed at all. But it is entirely possible to get addicted to anything given the right circumstances. Here's a bit on the science, and why all addictions should be treated with the same compassion and gravity. Please do not feel ashamed if you have an ""unusual"" addiction. Some of us don't judge, but do understand.

addiction,LinJo90,2019/01/17,"Living with an addict Hi everyone,

I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this, but maybe some of you can help me. First of all, english is not my first language, so I apologize if my post is not correctly written. 

My boyfriend has been an addict for the last 12 years. He is in recovery now and has been clean for the last 2 weeks. We’ve been together for a year now and are living together. As a person who has never used any drugs and isn’t really familiar with addiction, I’ve noticed his addiction after a couple of months of being together. And it’s been hard. 

I think anyone will understand that it’s difficult  to live in a house with someone who is addicted to drugs. Him being away all night, not knowing where he is. Arguments, all the lies, manipulating, etc. But on the other hand: I see that he’s fighting  against addiction. I know that he lost everyhing because of his drug issue and that he wants to quit. But the cravings are still there. Fortunately he’s getting help now.

I’ve noticed that I’m anxious all the time. Never relaxed, always worrying when he’s away. As I said: he has been clean since two weeks now, getting help (he is seeing a therapist and goes to NA meetings), which I’m very proud of. But he is still hanging out with his friends who are also addicted to drugs. We’ve been in a lot of arguments lately because of this, as I think that he shouldn’t have contact with them as long as he is in recovery. He doesn’t listen to me, which makes me question if he really wants to get clean and change his life.

I was hoping you could advice me. Is it normal for an addict in recovery to hang out with his old friends? Should I just trust him and hope that he will be strong enough to rescist the drugs they have with them?

Sorry for my long post. We’ve been through a lot together and I want to trust him. Which is really hard because of everything that happened in our past.

addiction,moonbeap,2019/01/17,"Understanding My Addiction: a poem (cross posted) Addiction is very misunderstood

It is seen as an unforgivable choice

You don't understand. It wasn't a choice

My addiction was never the crystal,

The burn made me feel alive

The high made me feel productive, Artistic

The thing they don't tell you about the 12 step program is that there is a 13th step

you're going to relapse

Addiction is so misunderstood

My addiction was breaking rocks

Watching chemicals go through all stages of matter

Solid, liquid, gas

""We were scientists"" *

Chemical pioneers

We weren't fighting a battle

To us, it was just another thing to keep life interesting

The thing about being broken, is that its not hard to find a filler

We were illusionists

Fucked up beyond return, unnoticed

The drug went from helping create art, to being art

My creativity doesn't exist without a stimulant.

The thing about Methanphetamine

is that it feels like home.

Finished art

a clean house

Poems that literally write themselves

Addiction is so misunderstood

It is not a choice

My addiction is finished art, a clean house, and poems

that literally write themselves

My addiction is high functioning work ethic

Addiction is so misunderstood

You don't understand

I was never addicted to a drug

I was addicted to feeling whole

to getting stuff done

I was addicted to the way a rock can turn to a powder with pressure

“We were scientists” *

Expiramenting with our psyche

How far can we push our own mind

No one is addicted to the drug

We are addicted to feeling alive

Addiction is so misunderstood

Understand me

addiction,IOnlyHook,2019/01/17,"I quit smoking and this was my results So first off let me tell you who I am. My name is Steve, born and raised in SoCal, I’m 21 years of age, and I’ve been a huge stoner (smoking every day) for about 2 years. I made a decision to quit doing that as of the new year. It wasn’t hard for me to quit, in fact I felt it was much easier for me in comparison to my other friends who have quit with me (one has already gone back to smoking). I haven’t even thought about hitting my bong (which I still have access to in my car) and I haven’t experienced any sort of “fiend” for hitting a bowl like my friends say they have. Anyways since I’ve quit I’ve been having the most intense dreams of my life. Mostly nightmares. They’ve had to do with different things ranging from people I hang out with and extreme situations at work. I’ve noticed that during a lot of these nights I will wake up early (like 7 am) and then go back to sleep and have a completly different dream, and that one will usually be an intense nightmare. I didn’t really dream that often while I did smoke but when I did it was never on this level of intensity. I normally wouldn’t make a post over a couple bad dreams but it’s consistently happening every night. My friends who have quit smoking as well say this happens to them every once in a while, but none of them experience this in a nightly basis like me. I never thought this would be the result of a marijuana/tobacco withdrawal. Anyone else ever had this problem after quitting a substance? Please leave a response if so, thanks for taking the time to read this

addiction,Fox_Data,2019/01/17,"High THC Withdrawal Asking for a friend, can't seem to find a straight answer online.

My friend has been smoking the Vape Pen with 90%+ THC everyday, at least five times a day, for the last two years.

They decided to quit cold turkey. It's been 2 weeks, and there has been a sudden onslaught of symptoms. Throwing up, at least twice now, feeling exhausted even with a full night's rest, and irritability. Sensitive to the light, and not really hungry.

Is it common for someone to have these types of withdrawals for high levels of THC?  And if so, would they really appear so late after quitting?

Thank you in advance for any answers!",5.123097928436913,6.906991177966102,5.123333333333335,81.68315442561206,69.42372881355932,7.956308851224105,27.517890772128066,8.515128840125781,2.003533709981168,501,17,90,8,9,156,85,118,0.041,0.8420000000000001,0.117,0.7993,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,2,3,5,4,0,0,8,0,9,2,0,0,0,16,14,7,0,2,2,0,1,0,2,1,2,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,6,0,0,3,2,1,0,3,3,3,4,3,19,10,4,24,0,0,0,0,6,9,0,3,12,61,7,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13480317037423686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18531825349388065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12784192502490702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13092901900858026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10023102390444676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18117859217360754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063039506835272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4188816725756155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16158387477546315,0.22361202913490755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18602538896562099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216839260712943,0.0,0.0,0.2539823766493769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18046111055961372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16795960180162806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20603682930437955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18250351410486734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558948378132915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19364186695046584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15900811684067706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14081687606693524,0.0,0.0,0.12765359499583

addiction,tea_cup182,2019/01/18,"Painkiller addiction and what it has done to me When I was 14 I became addicted to paracetamol and ibuprofen and I weened myself off of them just before I turned 18
I spent 3 1/2 years taking 2 paracetamol and 3 sometimes 4 ibuprofen every 4 hours. And if I didn’t take them I got the most horrible headaches, I took them to get rid of the pain without realising that the pain was there due to them. It never crossed my mind that I was addicted until I became pregnant and had to quite everything. It was years after until I realised why the first few months of pregnancy was so difficult and so painful. I thought that’s what it was to be pregnant. I would have never thought that going cold turkey on drugs that are so readily available would be so excruciating. Every one talks about addictions to illegal drugs but no one ever talks about something as simple and seemingly harmless as painkillers you can buy for 9p from Home Bargains. I am 26 now and have had 2 kidney infections so bad they caused sepsis that almost killed me and now I found out that I have (non cancerous) tumours all over my liver and I am just about to have my gallbladder removed. I have no one but myself to blame for this. I am in constant pain due to a stupid thing I did as a teenager. And sometimes I wish I’d gotten addicted to anything but them. Sometimes the easiest thing is the most destructive and I have to live with the consequences of my actions. I could die for something I did as a teenager and leave my 7 year old son without a mother.

addiction,martycastillo,2019/01/18,"Benzo withdrawal (medical risk) Years ago I was hooked on a very high dosage (12 - 18 mg / day) of benzos (Xanax) for a number of years. Way more than any human should be taking. When I decided to stop... I knew medical supervision was necessary so I went through a detox program. 

&amp;#x200B;

Years later, my panic disorder came back with a vengeance and I began taking them again. This time, I was very careful not to ""over do"" the dosage and haven't exceeded 1-1.5mg / day. But it's now been about a year and a half. And if I don't take it... all those familiar physical and panic withdrawals start. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this only last a few days and have been through it before. My concern is the seizure risk. Based on the dosage and length of time I mentioned above, do you feel there's a risk of that now that I want to stop taking it?

&amp;#x200B;

I can handle 3-4 days of misery, but living alone... I don't want there to be seizure issues. I'm going to a doctor this afternoon to talk about it with her, but wanted to get your opinion first.

addiction,gay_clint_eastwood,2019/01/18,"NA is bad, let me tell you why NA meetings are cool because imagine a room full of people who have like, sold their childs toys for heroin money. Now imagine someone in that room is saying something so weird and awful it actually creeps out the room full of old drug addicts, who have seen and done every fucked up thing imaginable. To the point that they're trying to stop the person from talking, and the person officiating the thing is going well, no I guess we have to let them keep talking even though this is horrible for everyone involved. And now imagine that person gets to the end of their fucked up story and says something 100 times worse than what they just said, that causes some people to get up and leave midsentence. That's the best NA ever gets, because at least its a novel experience. 99 percent of the time its literally insane narcissists talking about the one thing everyone in the room already knows about, in fact its implied that by attending the group you are acknowledging that you're aware that everyone in the room knows about this subject already in exhaustive detail: doing drugs and being a degenerate.

addiction,Stoicamphora,2019/01/18,"How to stop sex addiction? I'm  trying to get rid of my sex addiction as I think it kinda suppress my  potential and seems to ruined some parts of my life and sanity. The  thing is on working days I had sex like 2 to 3 times a day. In some of  the day when I can't hold it, I had sex during office hour. After office  hour it's like 99.9% certain than I'm having it again with a lady or  two. Sometimes a lady stay in my place until the next day and during  that time I can have sex for 2 to 3 times. So some of the lady I'm  having sex with are only a one-time thing if I feel that they're not  good, the concurring ones are the one that at least sucked the soul out  of me. It's not that the lady that I fucked are above 8, at least  they're fuck-able, nice ass, big booty can make it out, and of course  good body language. So back again to the point, on the weekend I need to  have sex like 5-6 times a day, sometimes it can be 7-9 yeah that's shit  as hell even I hate it but can't seem to control it. And anyone who  wonder if I got big penis or not because the confusion of how I keep  getting girls answer is no, mine is a very average size.

Until this day the reason why I don't go to psychologist the answer is that:

First,  I'm not the type of person whom able to talk things like this eye to  eye with a male stranger, so no male psychologist on my list.

Then  the only option is getting a female psychologist, which I'm 99% sure  I'll be having sex with her the second day I meet her. And the programme  would be useless, as things like this happened before. I even had sex  with a female doctor and some of the nurses after consulting about my  prostate health and checking if I got any STD's. Yes that's really,  really fucked up, it's not that I fucked them in the hospital but  afterwards, and even worse I even get to a 3 girls 1 guy situation,  fuck. And they're not the first medical practitioner that I'm having sex  with, the first time was a GP in her late 30's or early 40's when I was  getting an appointment for severe diarrhoea, it was 4 and a half year  ago. In some instance I even had sex with a porter girl when I was  travelling abroad.

I think it was all  started when I had sex with my English teacher in my third year of high  school while she's pregnant... when I think of it that's fucked up as  hell and it did changed my life particularly my sex life, it's like  opening the floodgates and all hell breaks loose. And just about earlier  this month I unexpectedly met her at a bar, and you know the story  afterwards, I'm telling all this because I want the reader to know the  scope of my situation, as I think I'm very addicted and out of control.  So is there a solution for me?

TL;DR

I  need help to stop my sex addiction, I can't get to psychologist because  I can't talk things like this eye to eye with a male stranger, and  female psychologist will only be my next fuck buddy.",5.766217874140666,4.36427693114754,6.6504230565838185,82.42996033844528,67.39344262295083,9.903754627181383,29.34955050237969,8.841846274778883,1.918966155473294,2248,59,510,31,31,753,239,610,0.139,0.795,0.066,-0.9944,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,0,1,1,6,23,27,12,1,42,2,40,40,8,6,5,85,83,45,0,7,15,0,1,7,0,2,11,0,0,8,40,30,1,7,13,3,1,2,13,15,0,9,14,5,52,12,70,63,11,72,4,2,4,23,24,23,12,17,52,320,92,5,0.12713796870574312,0.0,0.0,0.2771983043165455,0.0,0.0,0.056350069095784085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04322908923331053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04444891191203425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04888062508812868,0.0,0.11625318850658893,0.0,0.05409252360736176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07061081101434477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724755649881396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425960426643996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28697715183717026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06506554913366985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20993357315850772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03214238852307809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16221523684896552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4113795118808389,0.19927302366781888,0.0,0.0361277187555562,0.10663729613030837,0.10168384784845608,0.0,0.0,0.06294328881082566,0.056213842923449525,0.0,0.0,0.06276121132098038,0.0,0.06757085774738003,0.0,0.0,0.04260895023504925,0.06716412214823682,0.0,0.0,0.12520528918161622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056503034111231414,0.0,0.0,0.06987170265555014,0.0,0.07170858322010201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13470196081993852,0.21739616332969852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04243279067679501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403906393917465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05074015682697512,0.0,0.0,0.09427119283595654,0.0,0.0,0.13521267206736562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12922796692725522,0.14504123138550584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883901530185711,0.0,0.0,0.05550598516689749,0.06641605868012553,0.0,0.06009323752504205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08144783830664679,0.06535950331414522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433520595120812,0.0,0.11574163174154538,0.0,0.07181485812673334,0.06525264892737115,0.0,0.14290840369732746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125742701959422,0.0,0.04499445431272935,0.06775607919765725,0.0,0.10629303469939154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05991301544455345,0.0,0.0,0.10218868334501603,0.05556209424081366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21116204273262626,0.1629297534809305,0.0,0.0,0.18533792992194925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0431591675978755,0.0,0.06209766077806107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10490213914745954,0.03749463398691599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05736112085545639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06893785185936656,0.046278977711840086,0.0,0.06478222590584465,0.045157582601017036,0.0,0.0,0.08187268346445756
addiction,thinmugs,2019/01/18,"What is the sketchiest situation your addiction put you in? Last night I got into a situation in which a guy was trying to force me to fuck him. I met him for drugs, but then we ended up grabbing a beer too. I had to drive 30 minutes home, but he kept buying me shots at the bar and my dumbass kept taking them. We were sitting in his car counting out drugs and he started making me very uncomfortable. I called a friend who knows about my addiction. He’s clean but lives an hour and a half away.

He came and got me, which I’m thankful for because I was so concerned with hiding my addiction I would have driven.

addiction,trashmanwearingjeans,2019/01/18,"What qualifies addiction? After reviewing the criteria to becoming a certified peer recovery mentor, I question if my addiction was serious enough to help others on their path. 

I smoked weed from around 15 to 19, and when I was 17 I went to the doctor to get a prescription for adderall, mainly because I liked the way it made me feel. I began taking it daily, double dosing, taking half doses for an extra boost ect. Eventually I was swerving on the freeway over not sleeping for 2 or even 3 days, not to mention falling asleep in class, and eventually dropping out of college (twice). Im now over a year off adderall and 5 months 16 days off weed and nicotine. I want to become a doctor and am currently in EMT school. 

The other day I was volunteering inside a recovery center making grilled cheeses for people recovering from addictions to alcohol and drugs, and thought I could do something more. I’ve always been interested in providing help to people with drug problems, ever since I 
tackled mine. 

A man there asked about what I was in school for and what I wanted to to with my life, I gave him my plan and he said “that’s cool I should have done that”. 

So I asked “oh what did you do?”

To which he answered “Crack.”

What do I know about crack? Am I wrong to discredit my addiction experiences as not being serious enough to put myself in the shoes of someone who used to smoke crack?

addiction,PossibleEffort5,2019/01/19,"Riddled with addictions I've been addicted to something my entire life: TV, video games, potato chips, chocolate, shopping, browsing, etc. All the less harmful ones, thank god. But nonetheless, I can't go a single hour without indulging into one of these. It's like my mind has caved in on itself and left only those parts responsible for gaining these piece of trash enjoyments. The more stress comes my way, the worse this whole thing becomes and any time I try changing, I get these intense cravings and feel like the my whole existence gets deleted: there's no explaining this feeling, but it literally feels like the colors of the world are gone, like a dementor (Harry Potter ref) is about to eat your soul.

This world is fcked. No matter where you go, you can't go around without dealing with something highly addictive and nobody is controlling that, because freedom and all. But is it really freedom when that useless app or ambrosia tasting potato plays on all of instincts your ancestors developed over thousands of years? This isn't a choice, esp. not when your genetics are fcked (addictions run in the family). What is a human to do when society is trying to get them killed constantly???",7.951750539180447,8.806215490654207,7.096355140186919,73.50504313443567,62.31775700934579,10.136017253774265,36.5549964054637,10.035473477838034,3.8483038102084826,961,43,154,19,13,295,142,214,0.078,0.763,0.158,0.931,0,0,2,0,0,0,34.0,0,5,1,2,7,11,1,1,11,0,14,7,0,1,3,27,27,12,1,0,7,0,3,4,0,0,5,0,0,1,16,10,2,1,4,5,1,6,8,4,0,3,2,5,13,7,22,25,11,26,1,1,1,0,10,12,0,1,11,107,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5143855019744369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08021844440931851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10501150268275007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07190875484553637,0.1302801498680874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12478852708527205,0.10161412108154064,0.0,0.12747539553591986,0.13230480822446594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12161400512353013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207049353510762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315592043340812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112044070129071,0.0,0.1789359285136944,0.16854465556813295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18489138049033985,0.0,0.2011221691245984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12463370138960499,0.0,0.0,0.11616915493825412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13050786482676546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281664405179532,0.0,0.08332029772469435,0.2305217865648888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11910834815611406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15986868510591254,0.08971568422490127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12774173178576026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556970324077951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18162636325943146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351254755750658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10860388490925696,0.0,0.0,0.07836894501701766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06878479603463755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16017738740768284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363302426126753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2634015064880437,0.0,0.2274229955156176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12021371441560535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759638870910392
addiction,DCT1997,2019/01/19,"I'm addicted to the internet. I need help. I spend an unhealthy amount of time on my laptop. I do nothing but be on Reddit, YouTube, and looking up lots of other things. The internet is pretty much my life. I know it's not healthy to spend so much time on my laptop. I cut myself off from the real world, and am apart of the virtual world.

I spend lots of time on Reddit just browsing through lots of different subs. I go on YouTube to watch videos and lsiten to music. I do a lot of research on lots of different topics. Pretty much whatvever pops into my head.

I want to get out of my comfort zone, and start to get involved in the real world. I want to make friends, I want to get a job, etc. It's so hard to take that first step though.

I have social anxiety, and interacting with people is a bit nerve wracking for me. I use the internet because it's comfortable and familiar for me. However, I know the longer I isolate myself from the outside world, the worse it's going to get. I just need the confidence to break my habit and step outside of my comfort zone.

I'm 21 years old. I don't want to keep wasting my life. How can I wean myself off my laptop and the internet and get out into the world?",2.3481184668989563,4.0455685853658565,3.8484901277584207,88.33524390243905,76.5609756097561,6.962137049941927,25.53542392566783,7.793537801064563,1.358791173054588,936,34,197,14,21,310,117,246,0.086,0.774,0.14,0.9302,4,0,0,0,0,1,30.0,0,0,0,1,6,5,1,0,16,0,9,4,1,3,0,37,32,14,0,6,4,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,7,14,0,1,2,1,3,4,2,1,0,1,0,3,32,4,41,31,11,32,0,0,2,0,5,20,0,5,7,132,39,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12334587433376455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655640371356227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06897277006936951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235261608485806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2364270401408431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12618773291979812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09624195582642348,0.0,0.0,0.08741634256955133,0.0,0.2955706552876505,0.0,0.12860699328087308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013566192709655,0.0,0.11612047002469815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583939929422304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11227997665010103,0.10056939074203952,0.0,0.0,0.12436419878522655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598367750747802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501416914677584,0.0,0.0,0.480963545372584,0.0,0.0,0.07552585401783772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495260537171461,0.16779269604130728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10856666792459893,0.0,0.11872772590215143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844121120315233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2302203797019003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25756990727925066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11533812937956953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08008534281705504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850717338128383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751691951397118,0.0,0.1111654005892695,0.0,0.19792908101481446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772184230391937,0.0,0.0,0.2669458414383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153054715157132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07286233406711566
addiction,LolaSupershot,2019/01/19,"Are Scientology rehabs awful or great? I am reserching for my partner and I have heard some very conflicting stories. Apparently when it was Narcanon they were overdosing people on Niacin which is very hard on the liver, especially for people who have already damaged livers. It was also a front for their ""religion"" of course. Since the bad rap, they have changed their name to Elevate Addiction Services and apparently don't overdose people as much (but I don't really know for sure) though I do know they changed up their lessons a bit to distance themselves from the whole Scientology Narcanon indoctrination scandal. Having lived in L.A and heard a lot of bad  but also a lot of good about their group (the bad about their higher up levels and good about the beginning stages of Scientology; learning how to be an effective communicator and whatnot) and hearing that their holistic style rehabs (working out/getting healthy and learning how to attain goals ect) are actually really effective. 

My partner knows the history of Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard's sci-fi books and is in ZERO danger of falling prey to their cult so we aren't worried about any low level indoctrination tactics so much as whether he will be safe there. 

Does anyone who is not a Scientology member have any experience or further knowledge about their new organization (Elevate Addiction Services) and whether these rumours that they actually teach good life practices are of any substantiality?

addiction,ciosrataecz,2019/01/19,"Dealer can't come thru So I've been dealing with a 10 year coke turn into crack addiction. Basically a polyaddict. Popped too much molly &amp; smoked too much weed. I had a work Christmas party (I know, late af) 

I ended up taking a cab to the venues and after everything was over I ended up calling up my dealer. He answered on the last ring.  As of now the longest I could stay clean is 2 weeks. Well I got the itch tonight and I couldn't resist as much as I thought I could. He said ""ok come to x place"" since I had drank and I didnt wanna drive to x place.

""Alright I'm gonna have call you back"" code for ""im not be able to get to you tonight"" I bitched and I bitched about how much of a shitty dealer he was.   Makes his custy's work for their dope. I guess I'm not getting any tonight, I dont know any other dealer. 

Although theoretically this Is win, I'm still pisssed. I was fiending hard and my body and mind felt like it needed the release. I'll resort to smoking a ton of weed b4 going to bed. Fuck addiction is such a bitch. As much as I dont I'm very well thankful my dealer couldn't come thru with my dope. Now I'm a step closer from overcoming this.

Have a good night ya'll ",0.34522471087688444,2.376455517786564,2.1498199385155914,96.33909383691994,84.73122529644269,4.696764748938662,19.6470502122676,5.82211442006289,-0.2824242717025327,918,26,214,6,27,302,144,253,0.09,0.8059999999999999,0.104,0.3286,0,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,2,1,3,12,12,4,0,14,2,20,7,2,2,0,29,46,14,0,6,2,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,2,0,4,12,2,0,5,0,0,6,8,4,2,0,12,4,25,8,31,28,6,31,0,0,0,1,11,9,4,1,16,120,29,2,0.11176233503996763,0.0,0.0,0.24367488386761696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12109444332199458,0.0,0.1520044406418982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08593833696850167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12414275921450292,0.0,0.0,0.22824367970794454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2888200665704405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17846626069088614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11522205995854327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619692486088077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1979765120537752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044478025695834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073093683129531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10332247783017606,0.11678241447623053,0.0,0.06351711056723533,0.09374094410345414,0.0893865490150692,0.0,0.12311881224358953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10011709983600954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207225003561473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12284331300079734,0.09110121977772456,0.1260727819497468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054601431566928586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07460222648793279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128480985299899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107908789673109,0.08287035529673079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488138044680184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23353570543264576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10631157394021097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09245095846516437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11912377870075375,0.08925354513221177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403136695584487,0.0,0.0,0.1028957423615349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887268100477668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12156532716107828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922156311065718,0.0,0.0,0.08964900376893505,0.0,0.20097552263557056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16272862198416496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07197127949364969

addiction,danielmclennonn,2019/01/19,"Feeling hopeless w/ Adderall and other substance issues. Really Need Advice to help me. When I was 10 I was diagnosed with borderline ADHD and was given Straterra, It never helped me, I always had terrible grades and I hated school so much that I would often fake I'll or do what it took to get out of it. My parents told me they didn't want me on ""speed"" at that young age, that is why they told my doctor no way back then at age 10.

Fast forward to 2015 age 18, I find the girl of my dreams, she is perfect and it was the same tims  I started taking xanax to feel ""normal"" and because of this I COULD TALK TO PEOPLE regardless of mood, It was a miracle. But then I started abusing it and became dependent. I could not stand learning anything I didn't have interest in and had all F's in highschool so I got my GED and was proud. A year passed and its January 2016 and I'm 19 now and because of my abuse and habit xanax does not help me anymore. My dad told me I HAD to find a college to go to or I'm on my own and I couldn't fucking do it. By March I had lied to him and said I was calling somewhere. I am a pretty okay Singer/songwriter and was in a rut to where I was barely playing gigs anymore and the pressure of starting school was making me lose my mind, i thought I was done. 
HERE is where the road I went on turned into something I never saw coming; So I have always been an anxious person who felt a tad insecure, yet I still felt like I wanted to be someone great. I just could not get myself to do a damn thing that was commitment related or had anything to do with people or taking notes. In April I tried 1 25mg adderall from a friend and... BOOM IM ALIVE! I could practice singing and guitar so much easier I felt so alive in fact that I got a prescription of 20mg 1x daily. First thing I did was find a job, second thing was find a college and I found a trade school that does hands-on focus  third thing was for the first time in my life I was able to clean my room, car, and even STUDY properly, I was who I knew I was deep down. A person who can do ANYTHING HE WANTS! By June I had learned so much information from school that I could not stop, the motivation was endless. I started working 35hrs/week even with school 5 days a week and making Time for my girlfriend. This continued for 11 months, Feb 2k17 I was done with school and was making $800/week including my music gigs and other activities. I quit my 40hr job because I hurt myself working on one of the many cars I bought to flip for profit and had a severe back injury. I stopped taking my adderall for awhile here because I was resting..
I was in such pain I was prescribed oxycontin 40mg 1 daily. I loved the feeling more than ANYTHING I fell in love with the high as it is like no other. I SPENT the fucking FIFTY FIVE-GRAND I worked for AND THE 25K MY PARENTS GAVE ME FOR A HOME.. I blew it all on Oxycontin, Percs, fentanyl YOU NAME IT. 
I needed to try to tell my girlfriend how bad it was but I kept lying..  All she knew is that I was on adhd meds and I also had to take pain meds for a week after a mild surgery. I left and moved into a small trailer in Mississippi to ""detox"" for a while where she lived at the time. I was snorting 2 Grams coke, 80mg adderall, 120mg oxycontin, 60mg roxicodone, 4-12mg Xanax Just to get up and be normal... I ran out of money in December 2017. I went cold Turkey.. no FREEZING TURKEY and slept for 2 weeks (not straight), NOT ONE DRUG, I think but am not sure that i had a seizure and also was tremoring so bad that it would wake me up at night. I was almost ready to die. One morning I was awoked by the landlord who found me on the floor covered in blood from my nose. I had a bleed from dehydration and probably the blow. 
I snapped out of it and went back to my house in LA this time bringing my girlfriend to live with me. I told her everything and went straight to a lowkey outpatient rehab in January 2018. I started taking 1mg klonopin x2 daily, 8mg Suboxone x2 daily, and no adderall.. I could not leave the bed. My girlfriend cried and hated me for what I did and I couldn't defend myself because I was wrong.
One month later after eating again and taking vitamins I went to a doctor for Adderall and got one 30mg XR and two 10mg IR X2 daily. This helped but it was NEVER the same.. I was no longer in a fight for life with drugs but with my career because I HAVE TO BE UP. I now take one 25mg XR and three 12.5 IR a day or more on average. I lay in bed about 10-15 days a month and I practice music everytime I'm awake. Luckily while I was in Mississippi I recorded an album and it made me enough money to live for a bit but other than that I have no income and I can barely motivate unless I take alot of adderall with my suboxone and klonopin and dont eat. I know that drugs are bad and I fucked up, but please I'm typing this on a phone at 2am while everyone is fast asleep, I desperately need advice. I have the will to adjust but I dont think I can live without adderall there to focus me. Anyway thank you for reading, comments will really help me get an understanding. Peace and love to all!

addiction,Stoned4Good,2019/01/19,"Trying to quit my addictions need some advice. I want to stop using energy drinks and cigarettes for good.
Also i want to not smoke pot and drink beer daily, once-twice a week is optimal for me.
I started with pot already 3 days sober trying to stay off pot for a month and then try to regulate it.
I already stopped smoking cigs for 4 years so i'm sure i can do it again, my issue is cigarette breaks at work, i'm craving for dopamine 24/7

Any advice is welcome, Thanks in advance",3.9015611192930777,5.037882278350517,4.8988217967599414,84.6215463917526,71.57731958762886,8.017083946980852,28.290132547864513,8.418075326091056,1.9487184094256256,379,14,76,6,7,124,69,97,0.042,0.768,0.19,0.9096,0,0,6,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,3,3,4,0,0,2,0,5,4,0,1,1,13,13,6,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,4,3,2,0,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,14,13,1,15,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,9,40,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18865952615644505,0.0,0.33822191519616723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3819491550891105,0.13839497893611913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11768584964528225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11160854396136698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33906328145239045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451534258707055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18062831952504504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13813380233595404,0.0,0.0,0.12832083236934033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840692284301908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224918377655553,0.18445754676841414,0.0,0.28936964256777137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16310577558895345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593291987202839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524864899183633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494671513236465,0.0,0.0,0.2041490087414994,0.0,0.13881724946780452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259887938729976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114441280991575

Any reference to alcohol from other people makes me feel quite uncomfortable, which affects my socializing. How can I cope with this? I've been sober for 7 years, but still fall for traps some days like once in several months or so. sign sigh sigh sigh. And intense cravings are pains. I fight against temptation every day. When I socialize, people naturally mention booze.

addiction,itsmeoni,2019/01/20,"Addicted to coke! (Not that one) Hi, I believe I am genuinely addicted to coca-cola. I don't think it's the caffeine because I don't get an itch for any other soda besides coke. I would go as far as going out of my way to get one regardless of time of day (I've gone to gas stations at 2am just to pick some up).  I'd normally drink 3 cans a day but for 2019 I wanted to diet and lose weight and my main enemy is soda. Why do I get bad itches for this drink specifically? What can I do/ Alternatives (I'm on a low carb diet, so my options are limited)?

addiction,enahs32,2019/01/20,"Can’t get away from drugs due to my wife constantly using and throwing it in my face when I’m trying to change and be a better person. Advice? My wife and I have been together for 8 years and have done drugs together for a long time.  It started with pills.  She had a script of perc 30s and Xanax bars.  She would just give them to me and then I became addicted.  Then after a while her friend showed her how to shoot them and shit and made it so you wouldn’t use as many and it was a better high.......then she introduces me to it and I get even more hooked.  After months of that shit her stupid friend introduced her to heroin.  Then it comes back to me.  This whole time she has introduced me to all of this shit.  I took it to another level though. I ended up in jail for a year and a half from theft and shit because I was so hooked.  I get out of jail and 6 months of rehab and felt like a new man.  The whole time I was away she was still using and telling me she wasn’t.  So when I finally get home I was doing amazing.  I was so proud of myself.  I rebuilt the bridges I had burned with my family and friends.  Only to find out while I was busting my ass at work all the time she was still doing heroin behind my back and was hiding it pretty damn well.  Then I started noticing shit here and there.  To cut this short she knew I didn’t want to do it again I wanted to keep being a good father and keep being responsible and once I confronted her with the drug use she throws the shit right in my face and bam.....I ruin my life.  She knows how I get when I get hooked to the drugs.  I’m a different person.  She saw how successful I was and knowingly and intentionally fucked my life up so she could get high without having to hide it and made it so she could use more money and pretty much made it so she didn’t have to hide it. 


What happens next?  We lose our home. I lose my job. I lose my car. My credit is shit.  We are living in my parents basement and aren’t worth shit.  I’m doing all I can to stop but she keeps fuckin getting it and throwing it right in my face.   Oh and it’s not heroin anymore now it’s crack.  The only way I found out was her friend told me because she fucked yer over so she snitched in her.   So now we are crack heads that don’t do shut with our lives but do that shit.  Everyday I wake up I’m literally scared of what might happen that day.  She has stolen my sons PlayStation 4 literally 5 times now with no remorse and not one fuck given about how much it hurt him.  I’ve never done some shit like that. And never will.  When she doesn’t get her shit she threatens to hurt herself and then call the police on me and say I fucked her up.  If it wasn’t for my son it would have been done a fuckin long time ago.  But due to my record and what I look like in black and white on papers I would never get custody.  I would never have a chance in hell.  So that’s why I’m still with her.  She’s sneaky and threatening me with that shit to get her way?  Having people come to my parents home sitting outside, calling her saying bring my money outside or I’m going to fuckin shoot this house up.  Naturally all the dudes want to come for me when I don’t know any of them but it’s easier to fuck up the chicks dude than to beat a woman.  But that’s a whole other story.   I don’t know what to do.  I’m literally fuckin stuck.  I feel so bad for my son.  I’m the only one he has. Even though I’m on drugs and a fuck up I’m still his father and will defend him and do all I can for him no matter what.   

I can’t get away from it though.  We have lost it all and the “relationship” is literally just a guy and a girl doing drugs and raising a kid.  There is no love.  There is no happy times there’s nothing but drugs and fighting.  

Has anyone had this shit? Or gone through it and maybe came out on top?  Any suggestions from anyone? On anything I can do? Legally or just something to say or do to stop her shit or change her mind?  Anyone with any advice would really help.  I need all the help I can get.

addiction,YowPow,2019/01/20,"I'm addicted to videos and I think I need help Hello everyone, before I explain my situation let me just say that this is my first post here and I don't really know how Reddit works, so sorry in advance if I make a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a bit about me : I'm a 22 years old girl living somewhere in Europe and I'm currently studying graphic design. I'm living with my dad and my parents are getting a divorce (that's another story). I changed schools this year (since September) because the one I used to be in, I think got me depression and social anxiety for 2 years (I say I think because this wasn't a medical consultation or anything). Just before the summer, my parents decided to get a divorce so that was more problems added to my depression. 

So this summer, I decided to quit that toxic school before getting my degree and go to another one. I also started going to the gym, because I just like eating so much (I might also be an emotional eater) and it has helped me a lot.

I started fresh in another school in September and everything was awesome : my grades and the school, I accepted the family situation, my friends were great, and I was improving my health thanks to the gym. For a few months it was great and I had forgotten all about the horrible years I had before. Since Christmas at leat.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been watching and using a lot of screens : tv and video games when I was a child, then I got a computer and just started to watch movies and tv shows on my own, also with my studies I'm working on my computer all day, and so on. Now I spent most of my days watching Youtube videos or movies or tv shows, and I feel like I have to be distracted all the time. For example, this week I've been playing Pokemon on my old Game Boy (yes Pokemon is still awesome) non stop but watching something on my computer at the same time. It's like one thing isn't enough anymore. 

I've always spent a lot of time watching videos but the last 2 months it has been more and more and I don't know how to stop now. I'm losing so much time for nothing, watching stupid things instead of working and studying so I always have to rush my homework and it brings a lot of stress and my grades are getting bad. I sleep less and less because I can't stop watching videos at night. I've got exams coming in 2 weeks and of course I'm not ready, but I don't even know if I'll be able to study or just keep loosing time.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I'm stuck right now. I can't talk about this to my family nor my friends also because I've always dealt with my problems alone before and it's in my personality to keep things to myself (that's another thing I have to work on).  I know I have a lot of issues and I should go to see a therapist but I can't bring myself to it, posting this message here is already a big step for me. So do you have any advices to deal with this ? Maybe apps to help reducing the time I spend online ? Or an audiobook that could help ? Or even an online chat with a professional (I'm willing to pay for a real one, not like BetterHelp shit) ? Is anyone else in this situation ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your answers and for reading all of this (I tend to ramble a lot sorry).",4.211373487193921,5.029824003095978,5.278633549113426,83.36731987053194,70.57894736842105,8.287587953841825,30.006895581198982,8.507472789574589,2.1591343653250776,2510,99,509,39,44,829,251,646,0.079,0.835,0.086,0.6648,3,1,1,0,2,0,80.0,0,3,0,8,34,23,2,2,33,2,43,6,2,5,4,95,90,57,0,8,19,3,1,4,2,3,3,2,1,4,27,33,1,5,13,17,4,9,11,11,0,5,18,12,69,12,64,63,23,66,0,3,9,0,30,19,1,16,40,337,96,19,0.05113489301589328,0.0,0.0,0.05574458118101618,0.0,0.04996842564211916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05296032768761418,0.05642862599270367,0.1635702218811274,0.17019330928038226,0.2216185408751509,0.2485379680290505,0.03477348074100517,0.2144775754424795,0.039118053194801335,0.0,0.050712073516127935,0.03575470614219533,0.05239374073686756,0.04207965997682751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04269549976236271,0.15585678082785476,0.0,0.21756013846846825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05582605935217747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05409393656596555,0.04404818254033181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04082705118907663,0.0,0.0,0.06595555142219775,0.0527178293737684,0.0880848168517923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05232376139529505,0.04271664162862078,0.05751987207444208,0.0,0.0528360137039337,0.0,0.0675482291446714,0.0,0.0,0.04886158161438458,0.045956744645749316,0.0,0.09641085249289684,0.0,0.02585533834045956,0.0365307777877889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04349531387704662,0.0,0.0,0.07901338299698524,0.0,0.10686348434370513,0.0,0.0871834143150124,0.0,0.12269173561855785,0.11275280014410573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0543540001004962,0.0,0.0,0.13709856364507686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05337154304630602,0.0,0.09090208483787647,0.0,0.0,0.11240959963421117,0.04168176269120902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05228889260374858,0.0,0.09992770321740478,0.0,0.09030609473540503,0.0,0.0,0.057206865485711814,0.0,0.2608383446462024,0.0,0.0,0.03413293815706042,0.0,0.05137187303122764,0.0,0.0,0.05151302504992314,0.0,0.054246040709725885,0.0,0.0,0.08163076749989999,0.0,0.07518006004576151,0.03791587524340813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04798663312276448,0.0,0.04906530896444068,0.0,0.10731493681062987,0.0,0.1386013075560087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135584945751017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04464901621670867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09794618503848528,0.0,0.0,0.09785837339612533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054388253040798015,0.051148730844157206,0.05820270310486025,0.03275832184974985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043668919239264206,0.0,0.08132903866112112,0.0,0.20700496677492572,0.04074788927675015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05248923285265672,0.08459862383230217,0.1724332866536861,0.05117182202408562,0.052125583860780686,0.0,0.03936613886847562,0.0,0.11448265251188032,0.10858062139949767,0.0,0.04083639161612646,0.12825318069068287,0.058574847182936464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0411002900508536,0.0,0.09415627859898244,0.0,0.059371552012986974,0.13588700306063728,0.09829552412429997,0.0,0.0,0.17890300400090428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08832825906651524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08203465353630167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489072445168272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2485379680290505,0.1317167783156509
addiction,Apple-Core22,2019/01/20,"Parent of Addict Seeking Advice Hello Forum - as the title says, I am a parent of an addict. In addition they have Borderline Personality Disorder. We have tried everything to help ... nothing has worked. 

Our most recent and final (?) attempt was to set them up on a great medical plan that included suboxone and then sublocade (subQ shot), plus withdrawal meds, plus home comforts. We set firm but loving boundaries. A big one had always been no drugs in the house. Unfortunately, despite all the help, found them smoking in house. Again. Their drug of choice is Oxy. 

They’re refusing rehab, and we can no longer live like this. It’s not just drugs in house, it’s the lies, manipulation, theft, erratic behavior, refusal to work, refusal to contribute anything, sleeping all day, moody, rude, unkind, passive aggressive, leaves/disappears for days on end, etc etc etc. 

We’ve kicked them out. What makes this so difficult is the BPD. I don’t see they will survive out on the streets. 

TL/DR: parent of addict. Finally kicked them out.

addiction,screamoutofthevoid,2019/01/20,"How to brake the cycle? Hi all,

For many years I've been a lurker on this sub. Today I felt like I needed some actual advise so I made an account for this. I've been smoking weed on a daily basis for about 7 years (27M) now and a'll that's left is blend emotions and an attitude  that doesn't care about anything.

Do you guys have any tips on breaking this endless cycle of bad habits? I just don't know why I should't smoke some weed when I finish work. Except for the fact that I don't want to, but I just keep forgetting that in some way. It's just like i'm another person when I walk back home tonight and I don't know what to do. I've tried stopping a few times but after a few weeks I think to myslef, yeah why not, whats the harm? And 20 minutes later I'm back were I started.

I have a feeling I'm not the only one who's been in this cycle, anyone any tips?

&amp;#x200B;

For all of you guys sharing stories, thank you! It shows me there is indeed a way, keep going!

addiction,InternetUser45701,2019/01/20,"Which strain of Kratom for opiate withdraw? When I was going through withdraw everyone was coming at me going ""kratom!"" ""Kratom!"" ""Kratom"". Yet now looking back at this and doing some research, this seems like only a partial suggestion. I was curious, and started looking at websites and there's so many strains that do so many different things. So..which one is the one for opiate withdraw? Most the sites don't have a description of what it's used for, and it seems some companies have their own names for things. So yeah, how does one even begin to know which to buy?

**Background**

I've always been a very introverted kid. I never got much attention when growing up as most was put onto my 2 older sisters. I was put down a lot by my middle sister about anything I enjoyed or just about me I opened up about period. I think that is why to this day I have so many layers I'm hiding behind because I'm scared I would be judged, although no one else went up to my face and said something. I am a very very socially awkward person as I don't really talk to anybody other than 5 friends. I am just very closed off to everybody. I always put on a mask (different depending on who I'm talking to) as I have no self confidence in myself whatsoever and don't really know who I am myself. I have struggled with depression since I would say 9th grade. After the fact I destroyed my first relationship I had with someone by being a total dick and selfish. I had no idea how to control my anger or jealousy. I got over it, took a few months but I was fine afterwards. Now 10th grade roles around and I had lost most of my friends I had since elementary school, and was alone all the time. That occurred  I around middle of that grade. January 18, 2017 One of my few friends had xanax. This was the first drug I had ever seen in person, let alone take. I took one with him and school. Didnt feel much, if anything but still got caught. He sold it more than to just me also. I was suspended for 2 weeks at school and my suicide day had been in the works for awhile  so  I decided to go through with it and I had an attempted overdose. This OD involved a cocktail of who knows what. I was on one of the xanax I had bought from him and was grabbing all the prescription medication I could find at my house (which was A LOT) and took it all. I had also slit my wrists (one only very deep). Luckily my mom came up and found me just in time to save my life. I then was in and out of therapy, and meds. SO MANY MEDS.

**Drug Time (age 16-18)**

I began experimenting with DXM since I had no dealers. This was in March 2017. I took it 1 time a week for a month. Now its April and lucky me my friend found someone with weed. The thought of smoking weed has been in my mind for years I was overwhelmed with joy. Took a few weeks till we could get it. Fast forward to April 15, 2017 I had my first smoke. I bought 3g with my friend that day and was planning on waiting till the next day to smoke but I brought it up to my sister that I knew smoked and she had a pipe so she taught me how to smoke and only let me do less than a bowl and took the rest of my weed. She did give it back the next day all ground up and partially used but it was still plenty for me and my friend this night.

that brought my drug smoking career up sooooooooooo high i did from 2 years ago to today (not bragging i hate the fact i did this it ruined my life)

addiction,helpmepls711,2019/01/21,"Ativan Withdraw Schedule To start, I do not know if I am in the correct subreddit for this post, but if someone could help me or point me to the right direction it would be greatly appreciated. I have been struggling hard to taper off of my perscribed Ativan. I started at 2 mg a day and I have gotten myself down to 1.25 at night and .25 in the morning. I have sort of plataued at this level. I know from going over the Ashton Manual that it is recommended to switch to a longer acting benzo, but I am afraid if I tell me doctor that I want to come off Ativan that he will just give me one more months supply and I will be on my own after that. I cannot afford to hardcore withdraw like that, I will lose my job and everything I've worked for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was really hoping someone with experience could help me write up a tapering schedule to help me for this. When I started taking this stuff I never knew how hard it would be just to get off and become normal again. My doctor never warned me about the longterm conseqences of this drug, and even offered to up the dossage multiple times without my asking. Or if anyone has reccomendations on how to deal with the withdraw syptoms, especially the fatigue and face pain would be very helpful.  I appologize if I am not in the right area for this post. Thank you for any help you can offer.

Well we’re do I start? I’ve been clean a year and 11days. I got arrested on Jan 10th 2018 and have been clean since. I’ve had pill problems off and on for 8 years. Always considered myself a functional addict. I worked in the banking industry for 10 years. I would be hooked on pills a year then off a year. Hooked for 2 years then off a few months. That went on for 8 years. Always got myself off them . However each time it got worse. Last year it became worse than I could ever imagine.  I had everything. A wife of 3 years. I great job with money. A house. What else could I ask for? I started pills “ oxy “ again in May 2017. Kept it from my wife. She helped me so many times in the past to get off them I couldn’t tell her again. If I did maybe I wouldn’t of did what I ended up doing. As September came I went thru basically all my money . Maxed out all my credit cards with cash advances for pills. I spent over 40k on drugs. 25 dollar a pill for a 30mg and I was taking 13 a day. Over 9k a month. I look back now and don’t understand how I did that. I didn’t care at all. Lied to everyone only cared about my next high or making sure I had enough. I started talking to someone else, my wife and I started having problems then she became pregnant. Supposed to be the best time of my life right? Wife who was good to me. A baby on the way. But no I choose drugs and started cheating then finally snapped. In my head I figured wife hates me , a baby is coming I have no money and a huge drug habit. I stole from my job. The bank I was working at. Quit before they found out. Used the money on of course drugs. Figured at that point I’m already screwed going to get arrested anyway so what can I do to keep my drug habit and last a little longer before I get arrested. At that point I started robbing banks. Since I worked at a bank for ten years I knew the rules they have to follow so I passed a note and robbed 4 banks in a matter of weeks. I wasn’t staying at home anymore because I didn’t want to get arrested in front of my wife. I was going say to say just trying to last one more week. Through all this I still didn’t even care and didn’t feel like I was going to get arrested. Crazy I know. Anyways got arrested and felt like my life was over completely. Went cold turkey in jail . Now it’s been more than a year . I have a beautiful daughter who is 7 months old. Have a good relationship with my ex wife. Having a baby in jail and getting divorced in jail was the hardest thing . I look back at all this and it doesn’t feel real. That wasn’t me. I had everything. Moral of the story ... I never thought i would do anything like that in my life yet hear I am. I am more motivated than ever to have a good life but it’s hard when you have a felony on your record. Currently in the process of getting a great job however the background check is going on now and I am nervous. Trying to get my life back to what it was. Guess I felt like saying my story. Link to the news about my arrest. Anyways that’s that.

addiction,Lebowskin1,2019/01/21,"Need Advice Regarding Rehab/Detox Hell Redditors!    I come seeking some advice from those with experience in this department.   I have been dealing with a pretty large pill/heroin habit for a few years now. I have been able to stop for a few months at a time here and there, but I truly need to quit for good.

Background:  I come from a good home.  I’m married, but currently separated due to my addiction.  I have a wonderful 4 year old son, who my wife loves having me a part of his life...despite my addictions.

I just detoxed at home cold turkey for 72 hours.   I felt like death obviously.   Around the 80th hour, I could not suffer it anymore and used 3 bags of medium quality heroin and slept through the night.   

The cravings are difficulty, not being able ton perform my job is difficult and could result in termination if I take too many days off. I’m trying to see if I should begin a methadone taper to quit, tough this out and hope not to pick up again, or if I need to go to rehab...and if so which one?   I’m located in NC.   Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",4.230571428571427,5.381228533333335,5.3223809523809535,81.83928571428571,70.80952380952381,8.647619047619049,27.333333333333336,9.029198982220553,2.053419047619048,832,28,168,16,15,275,137,210,0.097,0.713,0.19,0.9756,2,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,3,8,10,1,0,11,0,13,5,1,3,2,39,31,14,1,11,11,2,1,1,0,1,3,0,2,0,6,12,0,1,2,0,0,4,3,4,0,1,4,3,18,6,28,23,6,28,1,1,1,1,7,9,1,8,16,106,24,1,0.25403192458724305,0.0,0.0,0.2769322943204749,0.0,0.2482370566516445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637520992260024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259657043880753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307113538911487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2188260095080833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20282382101707916,0.0,0.0,0.08191478791099745,0.13094787987253534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242459835754552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12195524256464516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218609845546482,0.2130699258807516,0.0,0.1400355468344554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08513612214383819,0.0,0.25481473285809925,0.12615550998089822,0.2501702748839933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12604374369192098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897151304762526,0.06205358335259033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463686500425235,0.0,0.0,0.1287742498221442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138292929980386,0.0,0.0,0.2825421798819181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11919587631530765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13328188604251864,0.0,0.08606930324909913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754590954882462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12922089671532244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2701942212062049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012152771359416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061910318757724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955001963132584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406402904872203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623550085063167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10970101002818873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13774339296923238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16358823067037725
addiction,Migitmafia,2019/01/21,"My cocaine/meth/alcohol problem is tearing my life apart again. I went to treatment almost a year ago picked everything right back up not even a month after I got home. I’ve been doing meth about two days a week for the past few months and cocaine is almost daily. I drink pretty much every day. I feel and look like absolute dog shit.

I tried finishing school again but fucked it up. Gone through 4 different jobs this past year(on thin ice with my current one). Blown through every last penny for this shit. Some days are fine, and others are fucking awful. I won’t sleep for days or I might sleep for a whole day at a time. I’m 25 years old living back at my parents house. I can barely hold down a job delivering fucking pizza... my folks know something is up but I’m never at home while they’re awake so they never get a chance to talk to me. 

I just feel like such a fucking burden to my family. I don’t want them to go through this again. I’m the black sheep in a family full of professional and well respected people. I just want to stop crashing and burning... I can’t even remember what it feels like to wake up not hungover/coming off meth(currently). My family loves the fuck out of me but they don’t understand addiction. They think I can just stop everything whenever I want. “Just quit being a pussy and do it” sort of mentality. I want to get 100% clean but the cravings are 10/10 some days and god damn it you best believe I will get high one way or another. I just hate who I am when I’m sober.. I’m socially retarded unless I’m getting loaded... idk what to do.

Thank you for reading this... I have nobody else to go to right now.

addiction,giantpurplepanda02,2019/01/21,"Questions about Recovering Background: 

I am 90 days sober in an hour. My drugs of choice were stimulants and dissociative anesthetics(3-meo-pcp, o-pce, DCK). It didn't matter what kind of stimulant be it crack, meth, hexen, or any of the many research chemicals that are out there. I was a pretty frequent user for the past year and a half. Heavy user of crack the 7 months leading up to my sober date. 89 days ago I ended up overdosing from meth and MDMA and ended up in a wonderful rehab. Now I'm in a decent sober living situation and about to move into the city that I'm living in currently. 

Questions: 

Physical touch feels empty and hollow. Will I ever get back that rush from touching another human being? Will it ever be the same? Haven't had sex yet but the thought of it seems like the experience would be a really confrontational and somewhat uncomfortable in light of the physical touch thing. Does that go away?

Lack of sociability. I have a hard time building personal relationships due to fear of intimacy. Maybe its because I'm afraid of them rejecting me because I'm in recovery. Maybe its because social interaction doesn't give me the same stimulation that it used to. Will that stimulation come back at some point?

Candy does nothing to me. Really all food doesn't taste that great. It doesn't give me that satisfaction that it used too. I know that drugs turn down the volume on all things pleasurable but does the balance ever return?

TL:DR Will touch(sex), talking to people, and food ever be the same after heavy stimulant and disso use? 

Thanks for reading.

addiction,blueberryisland,2019/01/22,"My boyfriends sister stole my ADHD meds. What should I do? I want to start out by saying my end goal is to help her. I do not want to enable her, and I feel like doing nothing is contributing to her self destruction. I want to establish firm boundaries as well, and I don't want any of this coming back on me since they're my meds.

A little backstory, the sister (28) and her son (6) just moved in with my bfs mom (52). I was living at the house for a few months until recently, and stayed the night again to load up my car with stuff. My bf(24), my daughter (1.5) and I (24) all live like 2 hours away now. I noticed a lot were missing the morning I went to leave. The pills had been in my purse in the room I had lived in for 3 months. The sister was gone at work by that time. 

The sister has had issues in the past with drinking (she has gone to rehab) and opiate pills. My boyfriend's dad recently passed away at the beginning of last year, likely due to his own abuse from opiates. She used to steal HIS meds. She also binges and then makes herself vomit, she has an eating disorder. Prior to stealing my meds, she did all kinds of ""nice"" things and wanted to hang out all the time. At first, I thought it was bc she was lonely (she's going through a divorce and doesn't seem to have friends). She took me out for a beer, gave me a bunch of makeup, made me dinner, just random stuff like that. I knew of her past, but everyone seemed to imply that happened when she was much younger and didn't have the same issues now. 

All that being said, she has a 6 year old son she could lose - his dad is a POS who I believe verbally abuses him...I don't want him to have to go live with assholes. She's not really an involved mom or the best mom, but shes def the less of 2 evils. Idk, I know her reckless bs isn't fair to him either. Shes also got a good job, she's an oral surgery assistant. 

Once she was accused of stealing them, she initially denied it. Then she apologized and gave her mom back 3 of my instant release pills. Keep in mind, I have 10 of those missing still and 13 of my extended release. Still, currently, she is telling this story that she took the remaining missing meds all in one night and no longer has them. Here's a copy of what I sent her: 

""[NAME REDACTED], do you know how much you would have to weigh in order  to take half of my medication and live? 1200 pounds. I'm not stupid, I'm not going to allow myself to be manipulated. I'm done with it. I have empathy for you, but I don't care that your compulsion to lose weight eclipses any remorse you feel towards me. You can't just send me these messages while you still are ACTIVELY preventing me from having my medication. You of all people should know that you can't dish out these empty apologies while simultaneously choosing to continue. 

I know I briefly explained that it will be physically difficult for me to be off of my meds for half of the month, and that didn't seem to compel you to give them back. I didn't take anything yesterday, and I don't know how to make it through that many more days. The only way I could get a partial refill of my prescription would be to file an official police report, and I don't want to do that. I know it seems like not a big deal, but taking someone else's prescription - a controlled substance - is a felony.  I'm hoping that you see where I'm coming from, and just give them back so it doesn't have to come to that."" 

She replied, 

""Did my mom not telling you that I gave her them back? She searched absolutely everything. I definitely see where you are coming from and like I said I don't expect anything from you at all. I own all of this and I am very aware that what I did was illegal. But I hope you realize that I was in an altered state of mind and literally have never in my life done anything like that. I was drinking before you even got there, heavily. When I drink on my medication I have suicidal tendencies and I seriously did not care if I died. I kept taking more and more throughout the night. I'm not trying to make excuses whatsoever.""

In her message, she's trying to make me feel bad instead of think logically. She thinks I'm chastising her for taking that amount, rather than telling her it's impossible. She thinks I don't know that she actually has done this type of thing in the past. This is what I said back:

""Let me clarify. I'm not accusing you of not getting any back -3 of my ir does not make a difference. There is still physically no possible way you could take that amount. Im not lecturing you on the dangers of taking them, I'm telling you that you there is no possible way you can convince me that you took them all. I absolutely refuse to accept that answer, and continuing  to lie to me is insulting to be honest.

FACTS - I filled my meds on the 3rd. Right now it's the 19th. I have 4 pills left of my extended which leaves me 11 days without. There have been 2 days at least where I didn't take any, so that's 13 pills unaccounted for of 20mg. Not even counting my instant release, that amount would kill someone who was over 500 pounds. You didn't take them all, you know it, I know it. No one buys this story, no one ever will. Stop. 

 I'm teIling you that this can go one of two ways, you can give me the rest or I can get them myself.""

(I know the getting a partial refill is a lie, I was just hoping to scare her into giving them back) she hasn't responded, only sent my bf a ton of harassing messages. Now, the other sister (32) and their mom believe her that she doesn't still have my meds and are super upset that I threatened to go to the police. They're telling me that I'm only doing it out of spite/to get revenge. 

Since all this has happened, I found out a family member of mine also has ADHD and has the exact script as me they aren't using since they switched meds. So now I have medicine for the month. My fear was that my doc would be able to tell I hadn't been on my meds , and would assume yes I was selling them. He knows that my boyfriend is in college and we JUST moved to a college town that has a bad rep for drugs. It all looks super sketchy on me, so that's why I wanted the meds back so desperately because I haven't ever done anything illegal. (I've only ever smoked pot, never tried recreational drugs otherwise). 

It's been 2 days since anyone has said anything to me or my boyfriend about it, and I'm not sure what to do. He said he knows his mom understands the situation to a degree, but he is fine not having a relationship with his sisters if this is how they're going to be. He told me not to do anything I'm not comfortable with-as in, file the police report if that's what I feel is the right thing to do. 

I'm so conflicted about what to do. She thinks that I won't do anything because I'm ""family"". Shes so fucking privileged, because she's never had real consequences. She thinks the worst that will happen is 30-90 days in a rehab place where you get to do yoga every day. I feel bad that she has so many issues and addictions, but shes totally using me. I tried to give her a chance to give the meds back, and she hasn't-just tried to turn it around on me and say I'm blackmailing her (for my own meds? Lol) 

I LOVE their mom, and the sisters son too. I don't want to have a bad relationship with his family, bc o really do value some of them a lot. After all, his mom let my daughter and I (and my 2 cats!) Live with her, without my bf there, for 3 months. She barely knew me at the time. She is such a kind lady? I feel terrible bc she's being taken advantage of.

Would she really not go to prison? Would she lose her kid? Is filing a report really the best thing for her? Would it be a wake up call, or just make everything worse?

addiction,12many4u,2019/01/22,"Today, instead of telling myself I couldn’t have my addiction, I simply said “You can have it, but on one condition: you have to wait until you get home.” By the time I got home, I didn’t want my addiction anymore. Of course, more intense addictions that exist all the time are harder to overcome, but I find many of my addictions to be quite impulsive and to occur when I’m not feeling good. 

But the trick was that I actually planned on having it later when I got home... and would have to. That way I stayed in the mentality of “you can have it if you wait.” 

Anyways, found this fascinating and thought it might help someone.

addiction,dizzyfizz94,2019/01/22,"My addiction....if you could even call it that. I want to start by saying that I know dxm doesn't have physically addicting qualities....but also that I became addicted to the escape that it brings. I know dxm is considered a dirty drug that is for teenagers...but I became addicted to it because of how cheap and accessible it is. 

Now, I haven't taken it for a week and two days. 

The last time that I tripped, I was awake for two days, eating more dxm when I didn't feel fucked up enough. I did doze off for about 30 minutes one time but just woke up and took more. Once I finally crashed out and went to sleep, I woke up feeling like I was hit by a bus. I was pretty sick all day, and for the next few following days. Swore off dxm after that, and have started to feel better. I've been doing things that I used to, such as art, and find myself a bit happier. 

But I still want to do it. It's crazy, too, because the thought of taking it makes my stomach churn. Hell, typing this out makes my stomach churn. I had a  dream last night about wanting to go to the store to buy it so I could trip. I don't know, it's pretty gross, and I feel gross about it.

Sorry it's a bit lengthy. I don't even feel like it belongs here 100% because dxm isn't legit addictive. I dunno...have lurked here for a min but haven't had the guts to post here.

They gave me my first dose of suboxone (4mg) and I'm currently waiting an hour to go back and see how I feel. It's been 4 years at 50-100mg oxycodone a day. not sure what to expect but I'm really worried about how I'll feel at work where I'm required to perform. (construction plumber).

addiction,zaiptir,2019/01/22,"BENEFITS from stopping smoking weed? Hello my lovely redditors,

I’ve been smoking weed for about 3 years. Almost every day, every fucking day. For the last 6months I had a hard time by stopping my addiction. If I manage to not smoke for a week, the one day I tell myself it’s okay for a one joint in a week, I start smoking every day again and I feel devastated. It’s my 4th day free now, and im asking you guys for encourage(maybe even tips?) I would like to know how you guys had stopped IT. 

And for the most I would LOVE to hear how life became better for all of you from when you dropped your last blunt/joint...

addiction,doesntsleepmuch,2019/01/22,"Need Advice I have been sober from benzos for almost five years. However, I just broke up with my long-time SO and moved back to my home town, where my addiction started. For a while I was fine, but I can feel myself slipping. I'm having strong cravings again and I can feel myself slipping. On top of that, January 30th is the anniversary of my grandmothers death and it is a very hard day for me. I'm worried about what might happen. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with this situation?",4.659642857142857,6.051181750000005,5.000238095238097,83.64000000000003,70.04166666666666,7.985714285714287,26.214285714285715,8.418075326091056,1.6939660714285711,392,12,75,6,7,124,71,96,0.122,0.797,0.081,-0.6174,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,2,6,3,0,0,3,0,10,1,0,0,0,12,17,6,1,1,2,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,4,5,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,3,12,2,13,14,0,12,0,1,0,0,1,5,0,2,6,53,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23851239306640495,0.0,0.4275963160961468,0.0,0.0,0.2190856608753102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487840778613685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529824127240064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16823529845316498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14110085745051734,0.22556193579378697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19146379941360298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22125266673363012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193474462005656,0.0,0.19599204226339406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21946328748581947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19362145203370865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2321006402764132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325381684009252,0.0,0.16222933149585247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459280942514405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15486003782463315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1805239054945557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22219093230514764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14089299505653927

addiction,TheRandomGuy0808,2019/01/23,"22 years old - Addict who needs help - I want to change my life I lost my father who was an alcoholic, he was my best friend. He was a brutal man despite being one of the most kind men I ever knew. He taught me so much, in buisness, in life. I miss him very much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lost my mother shortly after to cancer.  I moved across the country after high school to attend university. The girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life wants nothing to do with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have dedicated my life to keeping my promise to my mom of getting a degree. I am 2 semesters away from receiving two degrees in civil engineering and accounting. I work 30 hours a week at a local grocery store. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem:

&amp;#x200B;

I am an avid smoker, and an alcholic. I look forward to 5pm so I can drink, all while smoking like I chimney. I enjoy these moments to myself, I will not lie. I really do savour in the moment. I will miss them. They are moments where I just forget everything, I feel enlightenment during these moments. I feel mentally like the person I should be. 

&amp;#x200B;

These habits are creating mental health problems for me. When I am sober, I have been developing an anxiety to the point where I do not want to communicate. I smoke 3 cigarettes in the washroom at 6am, before I shower just to get me in the zone. I use to be a straight edge, and very ambitious.  I was succesfull 6 months ago, for one month quitting and I felt amazing, I felt strong, I felt mentally sharp and determined. I relapsed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tommorow, marks the day I hope to quit. I will be locking myself in my room and only leaving to go the gym. I will try to keep up with my school from my room, I will be forced to quit my job. I know I might be failing a semester, and I will have no income source. But I want to be clean, I want it soo bad. I wake up in the morning and hate myself for the night before. I do get very bad experiences of depression and mental brain fog during withdrawals. Those are my only withdrawals. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will post daily updates. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I understand this is a very ambigious question, but give me a **numeric figure** I can work towards. I am hoping someone went through a similar withdrawal experience and can share there insight. I have always kept these thing to myself, and now I hope someone can walk me through this experience.

addiction,anononthethrowaway,2019/01/23,"Are there any high-functioning addicts here who were able to get clean without treatment centers? If so, what's your story? As someone who has been taking between 10 and 40mg of opioids every day for nearly 5 years, I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck and am ready to get off of them.  I trust the lifelong battle will be hard, but there is certainly a strong part of me that is sick of it all and wants to be done.  I'm afraid that going 'public' with addiction treatment (support groups, treatment centers, etc) will lead to a public knowledge of my situation and potentially threaten my hard-earned career.  Instead, I've began tapering off by slowly reducing my overall daily dosage and am wondering if anyone else was able to achieve sobriety this way.  If so, how did it go?

addiction,bananasdonthaveseeds,2019/01/23,"Trying to push myself to go to my first addicts meeting. Hello everyone. 

I am having trouble keeping my life on the right track and I really want to push myself to go to a weekly recovery program. I have never done anything like this before and I am absolutely scared shitless. 

I don’t know what to expect, what to do, or what to say. But, I don’t want my fear to keep me from getting better. 

Support and stories are appreciated.

addiction,MorbidBby,2019/01/23,"Can someone explain to me what drug+alcohol addiction is like? My mom is addicted to a number of drugs and drinks daily. I rarely ever see her but when i do i tell her i want her to get better but she tells me she’s okay and that she isn’t addicted she just likes to do it sometimes.
she left me when i was 9, i’m 17 now and she’s so skinny, she has no teeth, she looks... dead.
She had her life on track and was getting her masters degree. I don’t know what went wrong.

My dad was in a  sub program to help with his drug addiction but he just got addicted to suboxone and denies he’s even addicted. 

My brother is schizophrenic and on drugs and he denies his addiction too. He ran away last year so i don’t know where he is anymore. i miss him.

My sister is also addicted to suboxone and drinks daily and doesn’t want to quit.

I’m the baby of the family and i feel so alone. I can’t help them all.

Maybe I’m just a selfdestructive person.",0.5542857142857152,2.6206048181818207,3.8204761904761915,84.46500000000003,84.15151515151516,7.40779220779221,20.034632034632033,8.418075326091056,1.259790476190477,242,7,52,6,7,88,43,66,0.063,0.833,0.104,0.0772,0,0,5,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,9,0,3,5,0,0,0,10,9,2,0,3,4,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,2,4,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,6,1,7,7,1,5,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,1,3,36,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7215164610191434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16209076734627767,0.3837691447521644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15598380959359265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16383440403672786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09093414865886916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083687379974729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14067074274305635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16622984351185172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14447592701457412,0.0,0.0,0.15641603644421406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15832576404284487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776453608661638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18692611562667386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321389816526839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19518875260185325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,bmaer326,2019/01/23,"A little bit about myself. Today is Wednesday. My favorite day of the week. I get to get up, feed my child, and play until super grandpa comes to get her at 10am so I can go to group therapy and work after. I'm not so sure what helps me more, going to therapy/work or just getting away for a few hours where the only person I am worried about is myself. Don't get me wrong, I worry about my child when shes not there, but with grandpa being the caregiver it's hard to worry. My father was a single parent, so he's got this...right? The last few weeks though something ALWAYS comes up where he cant take her; mind you I have an AMAZING JOB that let's me come and leave when I please so it's not like it's the end of the world. However, that's the only day I have childcare for so that's my only day ""off'. I've been visiting daycare centers to try and get her in so that I can lead more of a normal life (I love my child but have recently figured out I don't have the guts or the sanity to be a full time stay at home mother.), but everyone has been getting down on me for it because ""how could you leave your child with a complete stranger!?"". Trust me it's a struggle and I'm to the point where idk what to do. I do not want to miss out on anything or any milestones but I also do not want to be so stressed out and messed up that I contemplate taking my own life or just leaving on a binge..(I love alcohol and I love drinking but no one, including myself and especially my child, benefits from that.) There is SO much more to my situation that I could go on all day about it, but I'm really just looking for someone maybe perhaps in the same boat or someone else that's made it through this phase. I'm 100% sure it's a phase. But what if it isnt? What if this never ends? What if even after the teething subsides and I have a happy child again and am able to go out with her being happy that I myself am not happy? I'm so scared at what the future holds that the constant need to take my own life, and merely the thought of it, brings relief? Does this ever end and do I see any light at the end of the road? I tell myself I do but I don't believe it. On top of everything, women in my family have been known to give up and run away. I do not want to be that person and I do wanna break the cycle,  but I'm afraid that it's something I cant help and I'm mercilessly trying to find a different way and desperately need some support and companionship.

addiction,extermiknitter,2019/01/23,"Help identifying liquid being hidden by my dad I keep finding coffee mugs hidden in my dad's room with a clear liquid in them. I never tasted it. I don't believe it's water since I would find it hidden behind the tv or in the back of a cabinet that I couldn't reach. I know he has been using heroin based on the burned spoons, syringes, and walking in on his friend with a belt around his arm. But what could this liquid be?

addiction,Jagers554,2019/01/23,"Etizolam addiction? Hello, so I have been taking etizolam for an anxiety disorder that I have that has gotten very bad to the point where i think I was going schizophrenic. I have etizolam which isnt a prescribed drug however it is legal and is very similar to a benzodiazepine 

I take other drugs and honestly its very easy for me to have self control when it comes to other drugs (I only do pain pills when a friend gets injured and dosent need them for example) and i never get any cravings and take other drugs very sparingly (less then once every two months) and mostly do non addictive psychadelics and never had a problem with cravings or any of that.

However etizolam is my Achilles heel because im not even looking for the high im looking for relief from my insane fucking brain that likes to pretend its dying (doctors have prescribed me all types of different drugs none of them have worked) however etizolam works instantly and like a charm

Anyways i have been taking etiz on and off for the past four weeks, on and off being ill take it once then take a two or three day break then take it again.

I was wondering if I should expect any withdrawals and if i do get them will they be mild because of such a short time of usage or do withdrawals not work like that? I have only experienced withdrawals on kratom which was seriously next to nothing just an upset stomach.

Thank you guys so much im pretty worried i overdid it but I am not really sure if I have any other options other then going crazy.

Tl;dr i took etiz on and off for 4 weeks, on and off being once every two to three days rarely consecutive days.

addiction,throwawaygibby,2019/01/23,"Just found out my boyfriend relapsed after being sober ~1 year. How can I support him? My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 1/2 years. We live together, and for the first few years, he was a ""closet"" addict. He told me he was addicted to Opana and heroin around two years ago, and I was devastated. We broke up for a month, then quickly got back together because we loved and miss each other. He then went to counseling and began the Vivitrol shot. After about a year of counseling and the shot, he stopped going to counseling...therefore not getting the shot. I was worried but believed him when he said he did not need it anymore. Fast forward about three months, and I began to worry he was using again. He denied it, but I ended up discovering that he relapsed recently, and had texted his counselor about it. I'm upset because we're very tight on money, and pay our bills together, and he spent at least $100-200 on pills. When I confronted him, he was very sad and began crying. I understand (to an extent) how addiction can be painful and how it is common for relapses, yet I still feel like trust was broken. How can I help him without regarding my feelings of hurt and trust? Thank you so much.",3.921297640653357,5.802387500000003,4.634174228675139,83.58614337568059,72.70689655172414,7.815245009074411,27.72776769509982,8.532816995589336,2.0741,948,36,179,17,19,304,137,232,0.182,0.7290000000000001,0.08900000000000001,-0.969,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,4,1,0,1,17,13,1,1,8,0,17,6,0,5,0,38,38,25,0,1,6,0,3,1,0,0,5,1,1,0,6,20,0,2,4,0,4,3,3,7,0,3,19,4,24,6,24,17,5,38,0,4,0,1,26,8,0,0,30,119,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4238313022771068,0.0,0.0,0.11487767804427405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12852289080032558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11536655359393005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965014775637657,0.0,0.15799917166832592,0.0,0.0,0.1460085888101593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1423534396012395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11478223441583273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13105371544626515,0.09258231499798147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11023298966404356,0.0,0.14209364689291135,0.0,0.0,0.06770776156727436,0.0,0.07365152359654116,0.0,0.10364853604333764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686444125891403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387335600756537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06331331179178369,0.0,0.11443429096417385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11696406854712076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2068821385108584,0.0,0.09526684650895226,0.09609265714519707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13789765277596666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12795890436646834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12327401745321068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10349431085064197,0.1083467794670292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470622683723527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193131760693388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12383306938059975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12659496601572684,0.13491241327943398,0.0,0.1119280124779188,0.0,0.2138580193513747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12013537169858543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12492444413403525,0.0,0.0,0.263218949149354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4172729476011588

addiction,juneinhand,2019/01/24,"Wondering if my past abuse has impaired my brain for good. Hi, I recently decided I was going to quit drinking. A lot of my motivation comes from my hope that my depression and anxiety will lessen in severity along with having my previous cognitive abilities restored. I used to be a pretty witty, somewhat-ambitious(although kind of lazy and opposed to authority) with a lot of potential in my teenage years.Now I'm 24, highly antisocial, and I've walked away from several oppurtunities to put my life on track, and I feeI like I haven't wanted to do ANYTHING for a long time.

I was researching the effects chronic alcohol abuse on cognitive functions, and I'm not sure if my particular circumstances have put me in the position of having to accept that I'll never be as sharp as I once was. It'd be nice to look forward to being able to remember things and not feeling like an idiot every time I try to form a coherent sentence. My ability to convey and interpret spoken information has seemed to have taken a huge hit. It's like I struggle to barely focus on one thing at a time. I am starting to deal with my anxiety somewhat better.

Let me lay all of my past substance-abuse out there for you: 3 years of heavy drinking, smoking pot with varying frequency from ages 16-23, a lot of shrooms when I was 20, and a few high-dose lsd trips sprinkled over the last 3 years. Prescription pills were infrequently present, not counting adderall, of which I abused heavily, heavily on several separate, months-long occasions. I would consider this addiction to be the worse of all of them, and I kind of blame it the most for destroying my ambition an my ability to socialize adequately. Luckily, I haven't touched those in almost a year after my last breakdown with the drug.     

Drinking seems to be the only thing I've been clinging to as a crutch since then, and luckily I think I'm over it just for the fact that it doesn't really make me feel better anymore, just sick. Anyway, sorry for all the info, but I don't know if anyone would know anything regarding what to expect or things I can do to aid my recovery outside of the obvious stuff like exercising and eating well.",10.522234437464306,7.7393846529126264,10.416133637921194,63.54976870359796,59.26699029126214,14.54848657909766,43.895488292404345,12.926379034027164,5.6466800114220455,1735,81,306,50,17,578,227,412,0.077,0.823,0.1,0.7475,1,0,5,0,4,0,43.0,0,1,1,5,6,18,2,1,23,0,31,13,1,4,7,66,52,21,0,8,10,0,4,4,0,3,8,0,0,0,17,19,5,1,16,4,0,7,8,4,1,1,7,5,39,14,64,33,10,41,0,1,1,0,6,16,0,14,24,211,56,2,0.08363969148182003,0.3963974301695724,0.0,0.09117960939733112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938539373962998,0.0837530692906398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12796827010337894,0.0,0.08294809929442895,0.058482817003779976,0.0,0.13765667905192785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858224339745024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14794502041647306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093369557000452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07204818824717522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08622884931122785,0.0720387437148511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458051670672303,0.096995488274305,0.08558428505777119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07047004742374731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08458148220949525,0.0597522123066128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047534364146564916,0.07015300495666622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1767398523765165,0.0,0.08307308579957806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17419573571164304,0.0919323741430154,0.1363550235971979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855272513026329,0.059077187613149465,0.16344851381605274,0.0,0.0,0.14803698994762454,0.07023627565014938,0.0,0.0,0.2133224241425148,0.0,0.0,0.05583014353696316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06450808629420328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08907354172390655,0.056676419560310415,0.06361175432076878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15968709909551354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08509163524887497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16816198275405644,0.0,0.08896110730404036,0.0,0.0,0.05358172807995613,0.0,0.08258410497073311,0.0,0.0947474658654788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15228486767585095,0.0,0.2834671328483789,0.0,0.06918761710248482,0.0,0.0,0.08526013247099924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09362778693149876,0.059200604121961736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08743836566077351,0.09574743612581788,0.0,0.0,0.07882941938652517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222659781227723,0.053592937078828916,0.0,0.0,0.1463129301468927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05678586026261415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223783899531594,0.0,0.0,0.04933285706566043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07520212736529422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090703677581666,0.0,0.0,0.08523599115872386,0.11883047417740455,0.0,0.0,0.16158365723786985

addiction,CompleteThrowAway24,2019/01/24,"My Weird Addiction First off, there are so many of you on here that are going through struggles that, by comparison, dwarf mine. Nonetheless, I wanted to share my very real addiction with this community. I am not sure if I am looking for validation, help, or just a conversation. I've never shared this with anyone and, if nothing else, I think it will be liberating to share with thousands of e-strangers. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family is filled with alcoholics, drug addicts, and gambler. My mom, who suffers severe mental health issues that she's seemingly unaware of, spent my entire childhood reminding me that ""addiction is in my genes."" It took me a long time to realize that it would not be drugs, alcohol, or gambling that would consume my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I even reached an age where I knew what sex was or had an understanding of the relationship between men and women, a buddy in grade school showed me a video of two woman in a wrestling even stripping each other of their clothing. I was hooked. It was one of the greatest things I had ever seen and I could not stop thinking about it. Over the next few years, as I reached adolescence and middle school, the was no typical porn for me. All I did was watch these hot woman wrestlers strip and humiliate each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

High school rolled around and the content grew repetitive. I had been watching the same clips for years; and I needed something new. So I began to write. These writing were full on wrestling fan-fics that I shared with nobody but myself. The dark day came when I ""expanded"" the stories to include the woman of my daily life in high school. I felt like such a creep. I interacted with, and even dated, many of these girls who saw nothing wrong with me. We developed friendships and relationships without them knowing that I was going home to my fantasy world and writing these full-blown multiple ""episode"" stories of them wrestling, stripping, humiliating the other woman in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

The writings grew. There was continuity between episode. The woman developed their own personalities and rivalries. I would meet someone new and, next thing you know, they would be entered in this fantasy world that I created. I knew it was wrong, I knew that it was weird, but nothing captured my attention and desire quite like writing these stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got older. I went off to college. I had long and serious relationships. I never considered the stories to be detrimental to my productivity in life, but they always kept me feeling like I am a freak, a weirdo. There were long periods, usually during long relationships, where I stopped writing but the stories always lived on in my head. Sex would get boring and I would need to close my eyes and envision a scenario to keep going, and hope my partner did not realize what I was doing. It was not fair to them,  but it is what it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got an education. I entered my career. I worked hard. To everyone, I am a typical guy. Somewhat attractive, affable, professional- there's no signs I have this dark side to me. I worked my way through the ranks at my company and landed a job as an executive manager at a huge fortune-500 company. People work under me, people respect me, people look to me for advice, leadership, and guidance. Yet, I can never feel normal. I fear what these people would think if they knew what I do and how my brain works. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's during my rise through the professional ranks that I realized this is more than a weird fantasy; it's a full blown addiction. I feel like it's a hard addiction to kick because you can't really go ""cold turkey"" when your brain musters up all of these scenarios and moments. I've been actively trying to stop since 2016 and have found pockets of success, but also many instances of failures where I resort back to writing my stories with the new woman I've met along the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

On September 30, 2018, I permanently deleted almost a decades worth of stories and promised myself that it was officially over. It was time to be ""normal"" and stop this before it became a life long addiction. It's been nearly 4 months since I last wrote. I had a word document with a story outline written out and I feel so close to cracking. I justify that this addiction does not hurt anyone and brings me joy, so what's the harm? I am trying to convince myself it's OK to write and to just do it.

addiction,luap729,2019/01/24,"Relapsed on meth after 1 year off Do you guys ever feel like it's all pointless. Like you're just going to keep fucking up and ruining your life and the lives of those around you time and time again until you die? 

That's where I'm at tonight. My husband and I quit meth after a long bender in January 2018. This last weekend I got it in my head that I wanted to do it again. And I wouldn't let it go. And I finally talked him into it, and off we went. This is my 3rd day coming down and I'm overwhelmed with guilt and self hatred. I don't ever want to do it again, but mostly I don't want to WANT to do it. 

I know these feelings will pass. I know I'll forget how badly I feel right now, and relapsing will become easier. And it terrifies me. I feel like I'm broken. I would give anything to go back and never try drugs.

addiction,Brawnytommy,2019/01/24,No tobacco day 1 I’ve been smoking cigarettes for 2 years consistently. Just turned 21 too which makes it hard for me not to purchase a pack. I’ve tried to cold turkey before but have always failed those attempts. I’m realizing how much my conscious and my body do not want to participate anymore and it’s mostly just the addiction that has the urges. I want to quit naturally and with the sheer power of my own resistance. Is there anybody who might have some advice to fight urges? Or overcoming stories to share? I really want to battle this and any advice would be immensely appreciated.

addiction,SantaOMG,2019/01/24,"I am 100% addicted to food I can go 2 weeks without looking at pornography (nofap) pretty easily, I can quit caffeine cold turkey and never think about it again (clean for 1.5 years), but I can not stop eating.

Anyone else suffer from this? Anyone saved themselves from it? It doesn’t really matter what it is, I just eat to fill a space I guess... maybe I need therapy.

I can eat a whole tub of peanut butter like it’s nothing. Same with any kind of nuts. I can eat a half gallon of ice cream and go look for the next thing.

I don’t even really eat for taste... I just eat to fill time/boredom/etc. I don’t have this problem during the day at work at all, but as soon as I am home I just eat eat eat until I go to sleep.

So yeah... I’d really like some support... maybe we can support each other? Thanks, guys. I really appreciate it :D",0.23760115606936336,2.428788410404625,2.4482398843930646,92.91652167630058,86.86127167630056,5.540924855491331,16.164450867052025,6.961326702584282,-0.11259283236994212,637,13,141,9,20,215,107,173,0.068,0.733,0.199,0.9701,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,1,0,0,2,8,9,0,0,5,1,13,13,1,0,2,23,24,8,0,2,7,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,11,5,11,1,1,0,0,5,6,2,0,1,0,6,17,7,21,24,5,18,0,1,3,0,2,4,0,2,11,86,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363996216395183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058412626876198075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12012178616846697,0.08801120748035987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055396194650938015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7910429032157957,0.07175557912770425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09579740384498778,0.056733887737083134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386649786345972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464510351467507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09462477820589643,0.08505112897068473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861612835808791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944808060143687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392947036433199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426300436881204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17258934034555795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369123326403173,0.0662487457424329,0.0,0.09135199818550413,0.0,0.0,0.08242009496983142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08738771264583492,0.0,0.08219143626250493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09136159693021707,0.0,0.0,0.22011022083773524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595862372050035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181339562724409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19494886534541656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07908203971321415,0.0982302368904267,0.0,0.05706587777496925,0.055039066667283656,0.0,0.0,0.05008699252537409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06890106348030288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590047544805837,0.0,0.08280124775504792,0.0,0.0625337407111175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055314587877985134
addiction,herbalcamille,2019/01/24,"This journey is not meant to be done alone. I see so many posts every day and I have a recurring thought. My 2 cents on the topic of addiction.

I am in recovery from alcoholism, cocaine and adderall addiction. I have loved sobriety and I really do feel happy! But here’s the thing: if I was doing this alone, I wouldn’t be happy and I’d probably relapse after a few months at most. 

The key to my recovery is support and community. Find it. Whatever works for you, AA, NA, online friends, and being open with those around you in your life who may or may not be addicts themselves. I have made friends in recovery that help me so much! It means so much to have a group of people that I can go to who just get it. We encourage each other and do fun sober things together. And I have a BLAST! I never thought I’d have so much fun sober!!

So if you’re struggling, reach out. There are SO many addicts out there and we really don’t need to do this alone. 

Side note: a few other things that have aided my sobriety: solid workplace, gym membership, nature, good nutrition and sleep :) ",2.4033098591549305,4.526377629107983,3.7982417840375575,86.79989788732394,77.87323943661973,7.640281690140845,24.73450704225352,8.548686976883017,1.7577926760563378,837,30,170,18,20,275,124,213,0.04,0.768,0.191,0.9873,0,3,2,0,0,0,32.0,2,3,0,1,11,11,0,1,8,0,26,8,1,1,1,38,38,20,0,4,7,0,1,0,2,3,6,0,0,0,17,18,1,0,6,1,1,2,5,1,1,0,6,2,20,10,19,25,7,18,0,0,1,1,13,10,0,6,5,124,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5141463994990236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260072801989282,0.0,0.3663498929401085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10496269005070287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07604059572306017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12066032889237895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993421703463276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059617584498524424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10776533659409754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1821901139064078,0.0,0.06160181239726858,0.0,0.06700956041589269,0.09889523313082664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2510294936194098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07903092482400888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08328156784338613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10641613961350528,0.1115669456759352,0.0,0.23907943657024086,0.0,0.1284358543256451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09411265702698572,0.0,0.2600267799649297,0.08742693158349192,0.09093754767638801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08174222796320008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11292281087079005,0.0,0.12712424805401445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1510691521565761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09395702736914913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11799267073177093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12326253967227913,0.0,0.0,0.13380005566997105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349975500380977,0.0,0.0,0.18721079990286005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08583807834504817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,ThrowawayCam2525,2019/01/24,"Addicted to cam models and it's getting out of control. Like the title says, I have an addiction to talking to models on cam sites, and it's costing me a lot of time and money, and now starting to ruin my sex life with my wife. She has no idea I'm on these sites, and it would hurt her real bad if she found out. Also, the money aspect. We're saving for a house and I blew close to about $3,000 in the last two months. Everyone thinks I'm paying off my credit cards and student loans. But in reality I'm on these sites.

After I'm done I get anxiety so bad I end up sick. I know what I'm doing is wrong and hurting my family, and that kills me to no end. I've tried deleting the accounts, or getting banned, but I end up making a new email for a new account. And I end up not being to control myself.

Also everything I Googled for help seems to send me Christian sites against porn and masterbation. I don't have a problem with those. Heck my wife even likes porn so that's not an issue. It's more the talking to another real live human being. 

Hopefully I posted in the right sub, and I'm also on mobile. Any advice and support is greatly appreciated.",1.4302663043478248,3.388690204166668,3.672065217391306,87.32119565217394,80.29166666666666,6.007246376811594,22.518115942028984,7.079830092131019,0.7895289855072463,899,29,186,11,23,309,136,240,0.1,0.794,0.107,0.8283,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,2,8,15,1,0,13,0,11,7,0,3,0,40,28,22,1,4,6,2,0,2,0,1,4,1,0,1,10,18,0,3,5,0,8,1,5,8,0,1,2,1,22,7,32,23,2,33,1,3,0,3,12,19,1,5,14,119,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24365733270750395,0.0,0.10920499404252637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2681095843502998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07599674611237812,0.11718411200406467,0.08549172224655144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18662032022323152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2506838668866936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11436343395645253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39592450481654656,0.0,0.0,0.07381265135467059,0.0,0.0,0.10678600857517408,0.1004375455252009,0.0,0.10535199415255353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12253280542492435,0.0,0.0,0.1751610044916206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12320949389324234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490654164957089,0.0,0.0,0.1109972209767949,0.0,0.12894944063308894,0.2392705471972116,0.12615698514380766,0.0,0.11664243901051402,0.0,0.0,0.123639558731659,0.0,0.061417232485454935,0.09109465803418566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893535656066393,0.10919499758405066,0.0,0.098681081211322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500949685428503,0.0,0.0,0.07459685311665587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08920120420003062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158659699449183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10702971342567144,0.0,0.0,0.10693375813232814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25440168523010664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09543754889382912,0.0,0.08887149303124876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10173690399330422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910025821766832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12681743842775892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17964772243559612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07160763347693594,0.0,0.0,0.06516482236881703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07587382386557252,0.0,0.10916769804824976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07938703777579963,0.12218576731811685,0.0,0.0
addiction,Account_W1,2019/01/24,"Does anyone have any experience dealing with food addiction? It's wrecking my life. I'm not even really overweight or anything, although i used to be. But i get these insane cravings, to the point where I'm entirely unproductive unless i buy in and run to a store and down a whole bag of doritos or whatever unhealthy food in unhealthy amounts that i find. And then I'm just dead after i way overeat, and it sets off a chain of unproductivity and failure that lasts until the next day. I'm trying hard to only eat healthy, and to get into a successful routine, but it's hard dealing with this because it feels like I'm battling with myself. 

Tldr; I'm stuck in a rut of self-destruction brought about by insane cravings for shitty food in massive amounts. Any advice or help is appreciated.

addiction,freerunlady92,2019/01/24,"Tomorrow will be 2 weeks sober after going cold turkey and all I can think about is calling my hook up. I've been a high functioning addict for over 13 years.  It's easy to convince yourself you don't have a real problem when you're getting constant promotions, own a house, and are fictional. 
I've worked hard to earn my promotions at work and my most recent one I got in August and put me in charge of a team of 96 people.  On the 11th I got home from work and had a scary thought that if I messed up, it wasn't just myself on the line but the jobs and families of my 96 employees. 

The thought scarred me so much that I flushed everything.  I woke up this morning and all I want to do is go back to the addiction.  

I'm not sure if it's stress or why today is so much harder then yesterday. 

My family and friends have no clue that I've ever used and have been chalking up my recent ""stress"" to the new job and upcoming project.   I feel like a failure for wanting to go back to it so badly and 2 weeks is such a small span of time but I want to hold onto my sober time with a strangle hold.  

I've also worked ever day straight since the 11th but I'm off today and been up for the last 6 hours craving it.   

Any ideas for how to keep my mind off it or stay busy are greatly appreciated.  Just having an Internet stranger read this rant is appreciated.

addiction,WhoEvenKnowws,2019/01/24,"boyfriend (22m) is starting his journey of sobriety Tl;dr- boyfriends first attempt at sobriety didnt start in the best way.


i met my boyfriend when we were 16. instantly fell into our first loves. we broke up because we were going away to different cities for college. got back together 3 years later. Weve now been dating 2 years. it was (and still is) everything i’ve ever wanted.

In college (before i came back around) he developed a cocaine dependence. it started as just a fun thing to do with the guys and quickly turned into something he now does on his own. he was known as being the king of the partiers. i didn’t mind it at first but as our relationship has progressed its become a problem because he becomes this totally different person. Thursday-Sunday even the slightest things will tick him off and our conflict resolution when he’s using is inexistent, theres literally no way to talk it out or fix the problem. if i’m with him when it happens, we end up in these MASSIVE screaming fits, which is not only unnecessary but also disruptive to his roommates (and embarrassing). if I’m not there, my anxiety gets the best of me and i just end up calling him a million times to try to fix it, which probably just makes him more mad. if he’s out partying when it happens its even worse bc i freak out that he’s going to seek out a girl or message someone out of retaliation (happened really early on in our relationship and im clearly not over it). he did make some changes and stopped going out as much, but of course that just meant that he was doing it at home. luckily, ive been able to go to him almost every weekend so i at least know that hes eating snd not just spending all of his money on drugs/drinks and surviving on a bag of chips a day. it also gives me some comfort in knowing that if something did happen, at least id be there to try to help and his life wouldnt be left in the hands of the other dudes who are just as into it if not more.

last week his parents found out about him using (they’re a REALLY close family) and he’s now in a sobriety program. they wanted to talk to me about it and because ive talked to him about it 100x, i decided to just be completely honest since i know that if any one can, theyre the ones who can help. i think he’s secretly really mad at me, but he says hes not. either way, this is his 6th day sober. i guess i didnt even realize how intense his use was, because i think hes going through withdrawl symptoms. hes been super, super irritable (i got screamed at for saying Good morning today), uncomfortable, fatigued, etc.

i know that sobriety happens differently for everyone. this isnt the first conversation we’ve had about it. there have been many times where weve had heart to hearts and hes on the verge of tears or tearing up saying i dont want to be this way, this isnt how i want to be living, etc. ive always told him that id do whatever to help him. i offered to pay for counseling for him, to go with him, to take him to meetings, etc. i guess its also my fault for never really trying hard enough to follow through with it because it never happened.

im trying really hard to be positive about this because i know that the best version of himself is the sober one. im nervous that hes just going to get better at hiding it though, since now he has his parents on his back about it and its not like it was some huge personal revelation that he decided on.

im looking for advice on ways to help. i know that hes probably embarrassed about it and doesn’t want me to hold his hand and treat him like a child through it, so i tried not to ask too much about the meetings and such. i just want him to know that im here and be as supportive as i can be, since thats what hes always been for me.

has anyone been through something like this (from either side???) advice???",5.284414715719066,5.219882076923079,6.226889632107023,80.62028428093645,67.97435897435898,9.34671125975474,31.315496098104795,9.085049710711278,2.467835562987737,3020,112,619,50,46,1005,312,780,0.101,0.777,0.122,0.9754,5,0,6,0,0,0,86.0,10,0,1,14,51,29,2,3,25,0,65,9,4,8,6,119,122,49,0,15,32,2,4,3,0,2,3,5,1,5,55,38,1,3,16,1,3,11,19,13,0,8,29,10,80,16,113,82,22,103,0,2,1,1,92,48,0,16,42,437,135,4,0.052123968014128566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186987656654166,0.0,0.0,0.05219462467456972,0.0,0.0,0.12505055516708302,0.08674263390354689,0.0,0.0,0.03544608565663205,0.0,0.03987469286123401,0.0,0.0,0.03644629037810061,0.0,0.0,0.04640138245552932,0.04872887387474201,0.0,0.0489721837653774,0.12024034194699874,0.0,0.19064572262539767,0.11513365499884087,0.04435365766837605,0.0,0.1641026659126648,0.04609941389916538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05322439915141984,0.059615933424643136,0.0,0.0,0.05514024676743391,0.0,0.05465098876282242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06723129452165512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16337535766108088,0.0,0.0,0.04561403566638583,0.0,0.061088902313501364,0.051061644851972926,0.0,0.05333583204133376,0.0,0.0,0.0923327288943041,0.0538579925735235,0.1743960080533236,0.10328216784144492,0.04714911322226548,0.04391669114020981,0.049806685161076274,0.04684566147823914,0.0,0.049137838129364016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773464822611054,0.0,0.05715124053359795,0.0,0.0,0.054465243899878224,0.05000205970658084,0.20736276553820468,0.04371911136533885,0.08337659767199065,0.0,0.11484085455135493,0.051610923252564576,0.27655831663707603,0.0,0.09338567429990208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12353430612772688,0.1397503881351206,0.0,0.05228458984674901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28151414986538864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20052178762725945,0.042487990824852266,0.0,0.0,0.05663284376002276,0.0,0.0368167000972475,0.0763954136651431,0.0,0.04602641871183827,0.0,0.04377100537506954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04704391618833322,0.0,0.06958630679735142,0.052845522386046735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263034882126354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07663422790202315,0.0,0.08040243494639274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10596164911580563,0.039642626470699716,0.0,0.0,0.11575499604791326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09102527670953316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11239690694810664,0.0997511957877552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1669597431016608,0.0,0.0,0.11192326959339223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435321440316252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12935245492653094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0441644689497016,0.12038273137184866,0.0,0.0,0.11068083852297372,0.0,0.041626268187357415,0.04357797121659903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059149661205466275,0.0,0.05417676067757882,0.0391907370387671,0.12568581320682026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06925769648982139,0.06679786805974229,0.05121153392604064,0.0,0.06078780983777096,0.0,0.04940742698178645,0.049806685161076274,0.0,0.17694376387236202,0.056695909425166516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13505511829942785,0.0,0.0,0.18446440092106176,0.2068678981930529,0.04181070307165098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05311877648156516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06713225289935727
addiction,ConfessionBeer8888,2019/01/24,"Lost my dog recently. After moving to a new city to get clean, i'm now ruining my sobriety. I moved to a new city, in part for work, but mostly to get clean from oxy. At my worst i was crushing up to ten 30's and snorting it all in one line. I had a huge habit and a vast network to get as much as i want whenever i wanted. So i moved to a new city, got clean and shortly after my dog was diagnosed with an aggressive terminal cancer, last Monday he was put to sleep. 

So here i am in a new city, recently clean from a drug that consumed 6 years of my life. I dont know anyone, my family and friends are hundreds of miles away. my dog was my buddy. I work from home, so since i've adopted him he has been by my side for the last 6 years and now i have an empty house in a place all by myself. I havent used any opiates besides my morning routine of taking some kratom, but ive been drinking and doing coke on a steady bender now. I stay at bars drinking by myself to avoid going home. I know it's not healthy. In my mind i know i know that despite how much better my life is off oxy, i know how great they are at numbing the world. But in this circumstance coke and booze is what i can get, and its what im using to numb myself to this new reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped. I could easily move back to friends and family and the unlimited supply of painkillers i had. Maybe id stay clean, i am not sure. Or i can stay here and work through this, but right now its so new and raw its hard for me to stay sober. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing blind sided me so badly, its like i forgot that i was turning my life around, and now i feel like im starting a whole new chapter of addiction in my life. The really fucked up part is that, despite getting clean these last 6 months ive never felt better, but i know if i ever met someone here with some 30 oxy for me, id buy it in a heart beat and be right back in the same place. 

Sorry for the long, rambling post. Just need some people to talk to who understand addiction and sadness. Part of me feels like im blowing this out of proportion. Like he was a dog, not a human, but i miss him so damn much that im actively ruining my sobriety just to be numb to not having my buddy around.

addiction,WollyDoodle,2019/01/24,"Guardian of an Addict - I need support I am a high school teacher, and I took in one of my students in July. I knew he had substance use issues before he moved in, but I wasn't aware of the depth and breadth of his addiction. He's since been diagnosed with severe substance abuse of everything short of heroin and meth, but his drugs of choice are weed, acid, Xanax, and cocaine. I got him into out patient rehab in October or November. It worked for a while, but he relapsed on New Years. Since then, he's decided he doesn't want sobriety anymore. I finally had to give him the ultimatum to continue living with me or continue using drugs. His out patient therapist, the school social worker, and the school drug and alcohol counselor all want him to go to intensive in patient treatment. I agree. His legal guardian is supportive of in patient and is willing to take him against his will. My kid is adamant he isn't going. He's begging for one more chance. Promising he can do it this time, just please don't send him away. My heart is breaking. I know he needs help beyond what is available here. I know he won't heal until his faces his demons and deals with his trauma. But god what I would give to believe that that ""one more chance"" would be successful. I guess I'm just asking for reassurance that I'm doing the right thing. What have your experiences with in patient rehab been? I know a month isn't long enough. The one we're looking at is a minimum of three months. Do they work? Is forcing him to go the right thing? Is there anything I can say to alleviate his fear of being ripped away from his friends?",3.9492380952380977,5.669062273015875,4.457968253968256,85.54314285714291,72.30158730158729,7.5796825396825405,28.473015873015875,8.238735603445708,1.923783492063492,1276,50,250,20,25,404,172,315,0.073,0.8,0.127,0.952,0,0,6,0,1,0,38.0,0,1,1,4,5,8,0,1,12,0,32,13,2,2,1,38,57,17,0,6,8,0,0,0,1,5,11,1,0,1,11,15,1,0,5,0,0,6,6,2,0,5,8,3,36,6,43,42,4,40,1,0,1,0,40,21,0,3,12,163,47,9,0.0,0.11537980333285178,0.0,0.2123179334584465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10406999002083517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657515064445248,0.0,0.0,0.08013573927394294,0.0,0.09103749160206256,0.0,0.18298410834345646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828635143074486,0.10971431915293747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10039487562663088,0.0,0.0988390159768458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3387909055760258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061994371590743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875191888156648,0.09525667830825596,0.0,0.10957997881429436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10667542491601502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07523582489123495,0.0,0.0,0.18683223020194556,0.16603050885884815,0.0,0.0778839700860272,0.0,0.10727544575180288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539619595538113,0.06527200289370214,0.10288769732718132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10163979605733622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16055309809661025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08598864233396314,0.08617855458264463,0.08177497687489553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15545614923471687,0.10349991195499607,0.0,0.14441260668561964,0.0,0.09405055890053393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2639498097525565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10689439295805682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1663245914277646,0.0,0.07744077116042547,0.0,0.29566237087624364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11001208904703563,0.0,0.1611080808659817,0.0,0.0,0.09926701404122164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22101215797021093,0.0,0.0,0.07321791189380923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11306610402798145,0.12939036881454494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056783271267862326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10819316350493882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16821073038549772,0.0,0.0,0.11487491921728422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417881243476409,0.0,0.0,0.13835242811411033,0.0,0.0,0.0627097593642588

addiction,JacobS96,2019/01/25,"Is the idea that we need a substance to be stable all just in our head? For years I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety chronic fatigue and brain fog. I’ve been on and off antidepressants, consumed coffee, tried marijuana, cbd, etc. My whole life it’s almost like I’ve always felt physically and mentally at a disadvantage and I need something to bring me up to baseline. It feels like life is just on hard mode. Never really been “addicted” to a specific substance but i always feel like I need something.

Ironically now of days it seems like any substance I use I’m extremely sensitive to now to where I can’t even use it(maybe for my own good). I’ve been told by doctors that everything I’m feeling is just depression and anxiety symptoms and I should just take antidepressants but even those just make me feel numb or have other side effects. Caffeine(even one cup of coffee) gives me anxiety and gives me hella insomnia. Alcohol makes me more depressed the next few days and my hangovers are the worst. Weed makes me paranoid like I’m going insane. Starting to think maybe I’m just meant to not use anything at all. 

My main reason for wanting to use something is I’m an artist and caffeine helps me be more creative and gives me the motivation to actually get out of bed but the side effects are just intolerable. 

Does anyone not use any type of substance at all in any form? Can your brain adapt to not having something giving it a “boost”? cause I literally feel lifeless without the help of some sort of substance...",4.929200121193759,6.9455022229965175,5.393594909862141,78.6183457051962,70.32404181184667,8.336252083017724,31.293591880018177,8.964715089967882,2.7973930919557635,1226,54,217,24,23,392,155,287,0.14400000000000002,0.762,0.094,-0.9381,0,0,5,0,0,0,26.0,2,1,0,3,12,13,0,1,11,0,16,13,3,13,4,64,52,15,0,5,15,0,7,5,0,1,10,0,1,0,8,14,1,0,14,1,0,2,6,7,0,1,6,7,22,6,33,43,13,23,0,4,0,0,10,13,0,5,13,135,30,3,0.0,0.0,0.08472079275646079,0.09464326005904396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927808873178553,0.08693460709044415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14447726836647198,0.0,0.0,0.17711545290342326,0.0,0.19924412398921584,0.0,0.0,0.06070441072580685,0.0,0.07144292984192856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938327949242161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918489411163134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197946550748336,0.0,0.22432586410918656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886079880936494,0.0759740738283113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968238174766452,0.1720252753368293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07802545185245645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21948622257332712,0.1240440533978311,0.08335786020139963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04535825871000152,0.3331308111827413,0.049340057688340135,0.0728179154958247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07777090987583679,0.0,0.0890992090500552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11638310610539836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09800573798091664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1226427195243478,0.21207181492666208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17385290950995955,0.0,0.17443853504707713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749103820633733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19312094368646185,0.06695856263705638,0.0,0.0923307818733008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05882939344790561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055617143554386635,0.0892622555501162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790348655240265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2673436333731665,0.0,0.0,0.06144946450857833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09075989725190238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09023602396422764,0.06527552113446099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05562877835083214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08295728979664928,0.0,0.0589429914871782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37490973186474025,0.0,0.0,0.05120687017176023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09692799343217402,0.0,0.08368841511035065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05590725161153835

addiction,waismannmethod,2019/01/25,"Overdose deaths tied to antianxiety drugs like Xanax and Valium continue to rise People are trying to numb their emotional distress. As we often see with our patients, the most commonly used substances are opioids, benzodiazepines and alcohol. The more pain they feel, the more they will try to use substances to numb the pain. It’s a perfect combination for disaster!


Until we understand that the drugs are just a consequence, not the sole cause, and start really focusing on the issue of poor mental health care, people will keep dying. The failed drug rehabs often focus on the addiction, which keeps people further feeling unheard, unseen and, consequently, further depressed, which leads to more drug use.

Can’t sleep anymore with out nicotine weed and couple seroquel just trying to quit the nicotine though i’m super irritable with out it and at points it’s the only thing on my mind. Really want some advice on quitting, i’ve managed to only hit it a handful of times per hour now but I still fiend I don’t have the money to buy pods every week so i’ve just had to use gas station high nicotine vape juice which i’m guessing is not very healthy. Any advice or anything helps. I made a huge mistake by starting and I just want to quit. I’m tired of being a addict.

addiction,RhodaStorm,2019/01/26,"Help please... looking for the best paperback books to send an inmate The jail only allows paperback books to be sent from a 3rd party such as Amazon.

I am hoping to find a book that shows him he has a drug problem (says ""I can handle my drugs) and has probably tried everything out there. I know of weed, coke, pills and most recently meth is involved ( a lot of meth from my understanding).

He also has anger issues that is amplified while on whatever flavor of the day and hence jail..

I figure he has nothing else to do, so maybe I can get him to read a book or do a workbook. I am just willing to try anything to help.

I would REALLY appreciate your recommendations so much I can't express it enough.

Thank you

addiction,DoctorStacy,2019/01/26,"Please help me be a better doctor Hey guys, I posted this to r/drugs too, but any insight you could provide would be so appreciated. 

I'm a new, malleable, impressionable medical doctor. Wait, don't go! I am not yet jaded by years of medical training. I am about to train in ""addiction medicine"" to become a specialist working with people who use drugs, full time.

Guys, I want to not be shitty at it. I know that many people who use drugs hate doctors, and most people have very good reason to. My goal is to help people who use drugs lead healthier lives, in whatever way that looks like for them.

In your opinion, what can I do as a doctor to ACTUALLY be helpful? If you avoid seeing your doctor, what would help you feel more at ease? If you love your doctor, why is that?

Thanks in advance, and mods, if this isn't in the right spot please let me know.",3.6472527472527503,5.149115190476191,4.5511904761904765,85.45021978021978,72.69047619047619,7.312087912087913,24.232600732600734,7.882392219407189,1.180976556776557,664,19,134,9,13,215,105,168,0.039,0.6779999999999999,0.282,0.9933,0,1,4,0,0,0,29.0,0,7,1,5,4,7,1,1,5,0,17,13,0,5,0,26,32,8,0,7,6,0,1,1,0,2,12,0,0,2,11,3,0,2,5,0,0,3,4,2,0,0,0,3,17,5,20,24,3,18,0,0,2,1,19,9,0,5,5,84,28,9,0.0,0.0,0.08989573769532049,0.10042429259786403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06264469353964988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017391963018163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08147256890494936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735502473541961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5657317502299319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4273193692982243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046578591276658886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05235386425824914,0.07726580474465015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18242637575133028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094933340280624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24698411896811925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10125338001749236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09419884299436428,0.0,0.045005131861833116,0.0,0.08134356280864093,0.0,0.07735751823785825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0831418098198865,0.0,0.0,0.0933951237066202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18560222323371947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08896997716745741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2554573693897719,0.0,0.0,0.20223998266433585,0.0,0.0,0.08822540358863698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471460369938503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07866989454770212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07340763655907206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08481163075963978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05371585673975799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386860591261321,0.0,0.07600856824763429,0.054334706031275236,0.07312049184235156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08312388488425485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06706438714079035,0.0,0.0,0.13087867328244887,0.0,0.0,0.05932219780549525
addiction,GracefulMonkey,2019/01/26,"Rehab different for people who were forced drugs I have been wondering the following for a while and couldn't find anything through other research means: Is rehab different for people who might have been abused by hooking them on to drugs or sneakily have been given drugs without their knowing or permission?  
And I mean drugs that create a strong craving or addiction e.g. heroin.
 Is it easier for them to go through rehab and stay sober or is it the same no matter how you started? 

I guess I am pretty ignorant on the topic of rehab and addiction. And I am sure there are people who have much more knowledge than me, so I am very open if you can educate me on this.  

I would assume rehab might be very similar,  but maybe somewhat different because of the reason why they 'started'. Mindset and power of will seems important in recovering from addiction.  But it's all just assumptions, I'd like more info if I could get any. 

Any input is highly appreciated!

addiction,reddRupee,2019/01/26,"what do i do when it's my family with the addiction I'm crumbling under stress, I don't know what to do.

MY life has been revolving around my mother and sisters addiction and it subsided for so long that I didn't think my life was this way anymore. But I was wrong, my sister was recently diagnosed with many discs being messed up in her neck and I know she got prescribed medication my mom's currently abusing.

It's been two weeks now, I don't know what to do. Some days they are fine and like my dad said today, some days i think they grew a brain over night, but like today I feel like my life is out of control and I don't know what to do. 

My saturday woke up to my mom sleeping and unresponsive and my sister murmurring in her eye to take her somewhere that she had to go, abruptly my mom confronted me that she was taking my sister to the hospital.

About four hours in my mom contacted my dad that she's been vomiting uncontrollably at the hospital and she needs my dad to come and get her. That she has a virus and it sprung on a couple hour to their hospital visit, not that she was forced to maybe leave her meds behind and is now having a bad bit of withdrawal from whatever. 

MY dad is on his last whim and so am I. I work a full time job, with a very important position, yet I feel like I don't want to go on. I feel like this is too much, too close to home.

addiction,HerBotanist,2019/01/26,"Drug testing my mom. So, I’m not really sure if I can post this here but here goes. 

My mom has been on and off pain pills/heroin for 5 years after getting addicted because my stepdad received pain pills for his cancer surgery. 
My mom was extremely successful and they had a really shitty hand dealt

She’s been living in my sun room since July of 2018 after her house got foreclosed on, she doesn’t exhibit super sketchy behavior, has money for the most part, etc. 

She still does things though that are exactly the same as what she was doing when I lived at home with her and my stepdad, and I believe she’s still using. Sometimes she still nods off around my house standing in my kitchen the same way she did whenever I was younger and still lived at home. She blames it on Xanax or sleeping medicine, still the same way she did when I was a kid. 

If the fact that she may still have a problem is even brought up she freaks out and acts like I’m crazy for acting like it could be a thing. 

I want to drug test her, but don’t want to set her back if she is actually clean.

TL;DR: My mom lives with me and after 6 months of uncertainty of if she’s actually clean I want to drug test her to make sure but I’m not sure if it will send her off the deep end. I’m 20 and really just need advice. 

I love her and I understand it doesn’t mean she doesn’t love me, but I need to know more for closure and my own mental health. I lived with her tricking me and fucking with my head for 5 years and now it feels like she’s doing the same thing again.

addiction,boringinfo,2019/01/26,"What do you now choose to spend your money on? It’s so god damn weird how I’m starting to realise how much I went without when spending £400 a day on drugs. It’s almost hilarious. I haven’t had a bra in 5 years (I actually need one with these girls) so some of my mates are dragging me to get measured and go bra shopping. 

I used to ration my contact lenses to stretch over a month - now I’m looking at getting better quality ones as they’ve damaged my eyes. I hadn’t  been to the dentist or opticians in 9 years, went to check up this month and remove the worrying. 

I’m by no means rich- I’m fact I’m heavily in debt but it’s nice to be able to afford things that are so basic that were out of the question before. Now I have a monthly budget that includes paying back banks that I borrowed from to blow money on drugs, and I know what I can afford.

49 days clean!

addiction,iamhellen,2019/01/26,"Anyone else use food as a crutch?? I've been sober for almost 7 months now.
On and off everyday after around the 5 months mark, I've been craving. Anything, really. Even knock off drugs like Kratom..
Even still, I don't do it.
Only because it would take energy and money to go out and get something. 
Plus, my boyfriend has to stay sober too because he's on probation..
I notice that I lean on food to keep me away from drugs.
Even binge from time to time..
Just replacing one addiction with another I suppose....
Does anyone else have this problem..
Or I guess some could call it a solution.

addiction,helg5489,2019/01/26,"I need help Hi. I am 29, I have a decent career and job, I have been working for 8 years. I never took drugs until I started working influenced by the prevalence of cocaine usage among older colleagues in my first office (smaller firm, mostly only older finance people). I also was introduced to hookers at that point.

The problem bas become a lot worse,  now I will have a drink and invariably peel away from friends and head to a whore house. Even bigger an issue is that one place i go gives credit.
I am basically able to hold out fot 3/4 weeks and then I will lapse, have a drink and destroy myself.

Truth being told I dont know who cares, it isnt a chronic classic addition. But last night I relapsed, I went for a beer I know what would happen and guess what , I am fucked.

I have also worried and had anxiety issues and ocd and these are now becoming significantly worse. I am in debt, I cant talk to anyone, and I’m increasingly having suicidal thoughts where I never had them before.

Basically I see my life slipping away from me. I am in tears are my idiocy.

addiction,timmyhigt369,2019/01/26,"RIP Hollywood Dwayne A friend overdosed this week. I've been working weekends on the beach boardwalk and met Dwayne. He was homeless and lived in the beach. A real cheerful friendly guy with a huge personality. He treated everydaynlike a person who enjoys the beach once a year. He wore board shorts and bare feet and bopped all around the beach. Seemed like he was loving life. His stories were always fun and light hearted. He got drunk one night and got beat up by a tourist. He was all apologetic the next day. Felt bad he ruined the guys night. He told me this with agrapefruit sized black lump on his face.  He didn't use hard drugs afaik. But I hadn't seen him in 6 weeks,which is real odd. I think he found some fentanyl hookup and that was that. 

Fucking sucks. No one even knows what happened. Just a general rumor he was found in the public bathroom probobly from an od. He didn't talk about it to me but I guess he had a wife and kids somewhere. It makes me so fucking sad. Say a prayer for Dwaynes soul please.",1.7925167504187591,4.445754723618091,1.7563128140703517,97.23905883584592,84.678391959799,4.321691792294807,20.854480737018424,5.7366,-0.1336584589614742,806,25,168,5,24,238,133,199,0.081,0.816,0.103,0.3411,0,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,2,5,14,3,0,17,0,12,10,3,2,2,29,32,11,1,0,3,1,2,1,2,0,3,1,0,5,8,11,1,0,6,6,0,0,4,6,0,2,20,6,9,8,14,12,3,16,1,2,2,3,32,9,3,3,8,79,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11483332445467433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285596521281912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523052692720648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08900344282717597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600449258029983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09115267511403688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13250887581947232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30263627708051105,0.21324855799134795,0.255171484081998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207544655155566,0.0,0.15203085862036025,0.2732983138075868,0.12203960719145793,0.0,0.12362764368238426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16353959314426889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584533188287516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747880315275484,0.06742351044288288,0.0,0.12186318158842765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12455718827446115,0.0,0.09212110108332808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14677257885464026,0.25902144492863505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14697352041671596,0.1870349544023568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24100571226797676,0.0,0.15149083025686189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31416557645136056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10974913084007808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256368764244752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11092522878947088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884296557597528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318721136246202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11919419952275215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070131988022612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10047112895068057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887232761616573

Yesterday was 5 months free of gambling. I am a poker machine (slot machine) addict. 
I am really disappointed in myself. 5 months was the longest I’ve ever abstained from gambling. 

Tomorrow is a new day, and I’ll keep going. Addiction, in any form, is fucking terrible. I won’t give up.

addiction,d0paminequeen,2019/01/26,"Millennial Addict Culture is.... Having accounts for socials like Reddit and Tumblr where you can network with others and not be shamed.

Following subs or blogs about other interests but never interacting because you know you won't receive positive conversation if it's your account for your addiction 

Not even feeling welcome in the online mental health community because being an addict makes your opinions devalued.

I’ve had a really hard day and for the first time in years I cried hard.  I’ve always set the rule of never using substances when I’m not feeling 100%.  Only ever to make fun more fun.   Over the past couple of months though I’ve gone from drinking/smoking or doing coke, Kratom, phenibut, or Xanax twice a week to 5 times.  I don’t so much think I have a problem with anyone one of them over the others but more just with being sober general.  I don’t want to talk to anyone I know about it though cause I don’t want them to worry.   Anyways I left my house and and drove to a hiking trail where I’m walking around.  I just kinda feel lost and want to vent / have people who have experienced feeling like this before

addiction,Subtitles_Required,2019/01/28,"Not sure of how to support my brother. Would my gift be insensitive? Hi all, this is my first time visiting r/addiction, so I'd appreciate advice from people who've been in recovery or who are family members of those in recovery.

About a week ago, my stepbrother (23M) was put into a rehab center for young adults for his addiction to cocaine. He is a 3x cancer survivor, amputee, and diabetic. We've been siblings for over a decade now, and are very close in age, but not close personally. 

My dad recently put his foot down and said my brother could either get treatment, or be kicked out of the house. My brother chose treatment, and has been there for about one week. When I spoke with my dad this evening, he said my brother is doing okay, but seems depressed. As someone with depression herself, I feel deeply for him and want to help him in his recovery. He is staying in the city that I currently live in, a few hours from where our parents live. 

I am wondering how I can best support him in his recovery. I have a feeling that he is self-conscious about his addiction and depressed about where his life has taken him. I want to show my support by giving him a Bible with a message inside giving him encouragement (he used to be far more religious when he first got cancer, but has since fell away from the church). I have heard of former addicts finding comfort and strength in religion, so I thought this would be a great gift. Would this gift actually be good, or would it be insensitive / tactless? Especially since we aren't very close and he is depressed, I don't want to do anything drastic that would upset him or affect his recovery. 

Looking forward to reading your replies. Thanks for your advice.

TL;DR: Brother is currently in treatment, would a Bible be a bad way to show my support for his recovery?

addiction,Derek_the_Red,2019/01/28,Family Member in Rehab I have a family member on her 5th day of inpatient rehab. This is her first time in rehab. She has a history of lies and manipulation because of her addiction. I spoke to her today and she is claiming that her doctor suggested for her to start doing outpatient after her seventh day. Is it normal for someone who has serious crack and opiate addiction to go outpatient after only 7 days? Because I am not sure she could handle it without relapsing.,5.087305194805194,7.102295068181817,7.281038961038963,65.25227272727275,69.9090909090909,10.483116883116883,30.75324675324676,10.608840637214634,4.142851948051948,378,16,56,12,7,134,56,88,0.096,0.904,0.0,-0.7401,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,2,0,9,6,0,1,1,9,12,3,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,5,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,1,13,1,14,10,0,13,0,0,0,0,13,3,0,0,9,48,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4639649159195368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2594407444823038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16990278670021985,0.0,0.0,0.4117134960256171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21780892280342665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4012161552110733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18100682809264876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12093864741427138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20849796220726574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16184332462052414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18030400912519196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150620316841562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20056065813068508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408488181044842,0.0,0.20170868975062065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20513076396507085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,ZeldaFan310,2019/01/28,"Help with possible relapse First of all, i was a marijuana addict for 2 years. Smoked practically all day every day for those years, it hindered my education and caused issues with my family, so i had to quit. i havent smoked for 5 months, and i was just cleaning my drawer when i found an old grinder i had, and it has a tiny bit of weed inside. My question is, has anyone gone through this? Is it possible i can control myself and just do this once? Or is it too risky? Might sound obvious but im ignoring everything i read online about this, and i dont know, maybe hearing another person’s experience might help me choose not to smoke. If anyone could share their experiencies that would be very much appreciated, and maybe some advice to calm de anxiety.

addiction,Rubyjcc,2019/01/28,"How can I be there for a friend with serious addiction? So I am someone who has never had any problems with addiction but my best friend of over 10 years is currently struggling very hard. I recently moved to her town after living away for several years (her living here being a very  big factor in me choosing this city) and one of the first comunications we had was her asking to borrow money from me. It's been hard because I just want to see her and be friends again after several years and I just miss her. I've told her I will not be loaning her any money as I think that is just enabling. I want to know what I can do to help support her. When I had seen her in the fall she really seemed like she was ready to finally kick it and I was really disappointed to hear that before I moved back to her town she had already relapsed.

I just need advice from those of you who have been or are addicts and how people could be there for you.

addiction,SharkDiver,2019/01/28,"Addiction and Honesty   

Hello, I’m the loving (now ex) significant other of an addict (opiates) who when we met was clean and had been clean for at least 2 years (could be wrong). However, a few months into our relationship she relapsed (first time I found out she ever had a problem with drugs) and over the course of the next 5 months has relapsed and detoxed 3 times. I believe the fact she was able to detox and stay clean about a month at a time is very promising however the entire situation has been nothing less than heartbreaking. 

This post is me really asking others to share stories regarding honesty in a relationship with an addict. I’ve found that she will do and say whatever it takes to cover up her addiction.  It's utterly horrible to be constantly fed lies. Constant disappearances with excuses that make no logical sense.  When she is caught lying red handed she immediately gets defensiveness or completely disappears and refuses to speak with me.  When we would start talking again she usually refuses to talk about what happened.

She had been living with me for about the last 6 months, but after her 3rd failed attempt at sobriety I ended up having her leave, a decision that was really difficult, but I believe is the right decision as I can not continue to enable/support her habit. Also, my own mental health has taken a huge nosedive from the stress and lying.  

We had recently begun talking again, but within just a couple of days of us discussing a possible future together she was caught in a lie about her whereabouts. She is now refusing to talk to me completely. 

I guess I would just like to hear from others that might have similar stories? Maybe someone with the same problems (past or currently) can share some insight. To have someone that you care about so much lie over and over again is something I’ve never experienced, absolutely heart-wrenching. Worst of all it makes me question the love we did share. It makes me question if she cares at all.

addiction,NihilPraeterOptimum,2019/01/28,"At a tipping point First, I’d like to acknowledge that there are other, far more severe, forms of addiction- power to all working hard to live an addiction-free life. 

My struggle with porn addiction started almost as soon as I had access to high speed internet (I was around 16 at the time). Even with an almost daily consumption, I didn’t think of it as a problem until my mid 20’s. It was one of those hindsight-is-20-20 moments; it explained the sexual issues (it’s damn near impossible for me to climax with a real girl, occasional ED and a constant pressure to replicate sensations experienced during solo sex)

The largest wake up call I got was just under a month ago when my girlfriend at the time ended things because of my consumption. She had already given me time to sort it out last year and this was strike two. It gutted me and I think about it all the time. 

I am posting this, mainly as an acknowledgement of the problem (this is my first public posting about it). I also want this to be my first serious attempt to have my first streak longer than a couple of weeks. I want this to be my tipping point but I’m also sober enough to know that this will not be a walk in the park. 

And now my journey begins.

addiction,currentwavypearl,2019/01/28,"6 Days without THC Oil, Weed, Nicotine, CBD Been smoking consistently for the past year, my lungs have been kind of stuffy so I gave it up for life. This whole week was terrible. I felt depressed, suicidal, tired, cold, stressed, getting no sleep, no food, and feeling uncomfortable. Those were just the first days now I feel way better, I hope I continue to feel this way. I’ve been going to church and connecting with God and my spirit more and it has helped me a lot. If anyone is struggling just know that it is possible, it may be hard but God will always be with you",5.52405194805195,6.15649223636364,5.342207792207791,84.75045454545456,67.54545454545455,8.83116883116883,29.350649350649352,8.841846274778883,2.0472467532467533,446,15,91,7,7,138,83,110,0.162,0.745,0.093,-0.7184,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,0,2,4,7,0,2,3,0,13,5,2,0,0,19,22,7,1,2,5,0,5,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,8,6,1,0,5,0,0,1,3,4,0,1,7,7,9,3,9,11,3,12,2,1,0,0,3,1,0,4,8,58,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15430058318780096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12966366381325464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16400623612989412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2391863720600721,0.0,0.1597188358072411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28129146566238217,0.0,0.17805107457787447,0.0,0.0,0.15773480933044753,0.22423427239984156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09688452516396773,0.0,0.10538958497636404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16611743680602864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242962394590656,0.0,0.0,0.18418334172155112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1931067830706339,0.1019127417687817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309814572237325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15765409684954002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17702305902173168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2090552600815932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855734990872265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21242040873824689,0.19386170896463775,0.0,0.2028407990045446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21313551431678515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2943866091916538,0.14874844300027487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070366651156668,0.0,0.17875713464951648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11941700761127348

addiction,metertyu,2019/01/28,"Relapse after one month, changing perceptions So last night I relapsed after a month of being sober. I can reason with myself and think ok it happened try to stay clean, but something changed.
When I did drugs I would also feel like my perception of things changed often and gave me a more conscious feeling of my surroundings. So when I was behaving odd for a week, I would recognize that when I was high very early on and my mindset and thoughts could change just like that.

However, while I was sober I feel like this doesn’t happen as often. I feel like I am less conscious or aware than I was on drugs, due to the lack of changing perception. 

This is now eating at me and telling me I’m better off using again, even if it’s just weed instead of other things. 

I hope this makes sense and isn’t to vague. Can anyone relate? I could really use some advice to rationalize against this..

addiction,KrackaHonkey,2019/01/29,"I never knew tobacco would be this addictive. Background, I turned 18 a couple days ago. I bought a Black and Mild this weekend so my friends and I could roll a blunt with it (I don't really have a problem with weed, just something I do occasionally). After we were done rolling the blunt, I didn't want to waste anything, so I put the tobacco we took out in a plastic bag and set it in my room. On Sunday, I packed a bowl of said tobacco in a pipe and smoked it. Not really into it, but I figured that was because I was smoking it out of a pipe. Yesterday, I bought another full B&amp;M from a gas station and smoked about a quarter of it in a parking lot. I fucking hated it. Minimal buzz, taste was okay, but my lungs felt awful and it just made me feel sick and gross. I flushed it the moment I got home. But, for some reason, I wanted to try more. Ended up smoking two more bowls of the leftover blunt tobacco. Hated that too, threw the rest away.

&amp;#x200B;

I've wanted to smoke all day today. Even though I know I hate it, I want it. All day, whenever my mind drifts, I think about sucking the smoke into my lungs, holding it in for a second, and then slowly blowing it out, taking time to take in the taste as I do all of it. All day there's been this voice in the back of my head saying ""Of course you didn't enjoy it the first time! It was just bad luck. I bet if you buy a pack of cigs you'll really enjoy it. And besides, you can control your weed habits, right? This'll be no different.""

addiction,Hohenheim69,2019/01/29,"Shame/guilt and addiction When I worked with my therapist a few months back he had mentioned the “cringeworthy” moments I have are called “shame”. I always thought I knew what the word meant but never understood how it’s affected my behaviors. 

I am an addict in recovery, I had some time without the fog of addiction clouding over my head. Addiction has plaqued most of my 20s, I have never admitted guilt and Shame led me to abuse drugs. I’ve been sober for a few weeks now, I had a slip, but my brain fog is much clearer than a few months ago. Unfortunately, more “cringeworthy” moments are popping up in my head. More “crap, why did I do that??.” Then I would say something outloud like a nutjob. I used to quiet this noise with a drug cocktail, but now I’m trying to recognize it, process it, and eventually forgive myself

 I decided to improve my circumstances and my way of thinking. And to stop saying stuff out loud lol. I listened to a YouTube video on Shame and how to deal with it while on the bike. I am surprised to learn that shame and guilt stemmed from pride, can be toxic, it can be a useless emotion, and it can be selfish. 

I am trying to learn how to live a shame-free life. Right now I am trying to improve my myself by recognizing whenever I feel shameful and recognize my triggers and write it down under “notes” in my phone. I want to get out of my head and start living in the presence. 

If anyone has any experience with dealing with the cringes plz let me know. Thanks.

addiction,FelisOctopus,2019/01/29,"Getting over alcohol I'm 29 years old, ever since my late teens I've struggled with some form of addiction. Over the last 4 years it has gotten pretty bad. I have drank almost every night due to the complete discontent with my life. Over the last 6 months I've really tried to convince myself I can't keep walking this road. I have not had a drink in two days now. I feel good, but I want to continue this and not give up.

addiction,flipdaberdy,2019/01/29,"PTSD enhanced I've been writing a lot since I stopped the needing to get high non stop to numb the pain thing.
One thing I found is the scary similarities between PTSD that occurs in youth(formative years) and the more widely accepted understandable combat PTSD.
In fact the only differences I've found are

2: society's reaction

addiction,Nightman_Cometh16,2019/01/29,"Maybe I’m just dumb Before I delve into my personal demons I just want to say, I realize that there are many people that struggle with much more serious problems and demons then myself. I’m just trying to reach out to other people because I’m not sure what to do with myself. 
I’ve been smoking pot several times a day for 4 years now, it’s become my only pastime to the point where I don’t enjoy anything without it. However I’m on probation and am now onto my 3rd violation (not related to weed) and it would seem that anyone else in my shoes would just stop but I find that the heavier consequences I’m facing the harder it is for me to quit. I’ve made several attempts to get clean (21 days being the longest) and at this point don’t have much faith that I’ll ever find anything that will motivate me to quit. I hate myself for being so weak that something as innocent as pot could take hold of me like this but there’s no question for me that it has. I don’t know what else to do with my life everyone tells me find new hobbies, I go to the gym 5-6 days a week but that’s the only thing besides dope that gives me any sense of pleasure and even that is nowhere near the feeling of smoking. When I am able to smoke pot like I want to I’m a happy person who is content with who I am and my place on this earth. But when I quit all the sudden these insecurities, doubt, and self hatred slip in and I don’t know any way to make it go away besides smoking. It’s gotten to the point where it’s like I don’t feel anything at all and that’s the scariest part, I’m sad but I can’t cry, I don’t remember my last genuine laugh, and everything just seems pointless. Does anyone have alternative hobbies or anything that helped distract you? Again I know my problems are on a much smaller scale then other peoples on this subreddit but I just need some advice.",4.563671875000002,4.812859273437503,5.4921875,84.18406250000002,69.546875,8.275,29.020833333333336,8.07648339933343,1.7817364583333335,1467,50,307,18,24,483,187,384,0.135,0.755,0.11,-0.8538,1,0,2,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,0,5,18,21,3,4,14,0,27,4,2,3,4,64,53,24,0,8,16,0,2,3,0,3,2,1,1,3,33,16,0,2,14,1,0,2,11,12,0,0,3,3,36,9,42,44,8,40,3,1,0,0,11,19,1,6,21,200,69,1,0.09102529817450476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08894886788891447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238006482982802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12729400985442824,0.09326617485185236,0.2996242581582792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08552126400453293,0.0,0.0,0.055488176900905885,0.10053029033926728,0.07745582441650453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267629379641814,0.0,0.09998701582597601,0.17611136096256544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796568518411689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15207991302729995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060121350964227466,0.08233759349550841,0.0,0.08697857320919558,0.08180766865413631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09205025152244073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24958642040753984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04755696136554415,0.08731976032402614,0.10346354926278133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689812251530218,0.0,0.08986863692163549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0610123386354338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500753700785174,0.0741977669969311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06429386003853145,0.13341108846796507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08613033803235101,0.06076009335450608,0.0922853653634641,0.09144714664792396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20074220298991274,0.0674941052190301,0.0,0.08791280019147152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13845768203747852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09857152757243612,0.0,0.1893164418009125,0.15895955871310855,0.09510206284522367,0.0,0.2581449862541904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17419783423592491,0.0,0.0,0.1019691660735689,0.290449827402024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10311391851031072,0.0,0.0,0.07238697059631516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657320255739147,0.09495923787589224,0.2056653552323231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07007572162844307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07610122511693107,0.0,0.0951594053631018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579026628931559,0.0,0.06843969598909716,0.0,0.0795601227069398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06047316344139941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053077583371611066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06180020240299116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10737815849495404,0.07225164481204377,0.07301500363424204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774513919488232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12932352035955486,0.0,0.0,0.0586173076427518
addiction,Usseerr22,2019/01/29,"Day 2 suboxone withdrawal.... I’ve been on suboxone for about 8 months. I started at 16mg and went down to about 1mg a day, hard to say for sure because I would just tear a piece off. I ran out and I can’t get more because my insurance also ran out. Right now is exactly 48 hours without any sub. Yesterday the runny nose, body aches, sneezing and restlessness started. Today I already feel a little better but I also haven’t left the couch. I worked yesterday and do again today and the rest of the week!! So I’m hoping this doesn’t get TOO horrible. I had trouble sleeping last night. I tried CBD oil and it did help me sleep. I also have clodine to help me sleep. I know everybody is different. I’m trying not to think about it but I can’t help it!! I just want this to be over and I want to be clean of everytbing. It started with oxycodone then fentanyl pills to the subs. There are so many scary stories out there and very few positive ones. I see a few people say it was easy to stop at 1mg, others say it took months. Just need some positive stories please!!",1.6930449978156403,3.7356338440366974,3.2897640891218884,89.96622324159023,79.8256880733945,6.7211882918304955,23.683704674530357,7.793537801064563,1.173722761031018,830,29,177,14,21,274,129,218,0.087,0.725,0.188,0.9755,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,2,16,5,0,1,9,0,16,6,5,0,2,31,35,16,0,5,7,0,2,0,0,1,1,3,2,0,9,12,0,1,3,0,0,4,6,2,0,1,8,8,18,3,26,24,6,35,0,0,1,0,6,12,0,2,19,110,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13488429128304075,0.29324283196659434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08312086680617434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490210406777558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10810286020505297,0.0,0.13577042499606296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1576569986112299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277047577279944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061803365341326175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12772068339570036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10949443431188284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24578539173867384,0.0,0.0,0.12140237171502972,0.12037232740811865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06717463394391103,0.09963409388629417,0.0,0.0,0.1328036925891413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12250697681143065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12392244577029725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.195126286125386,0.0,0.0,0.09063229647386026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11470495490463126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828264857229215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08473917252968648,0.0,0.0,0.1341722795026959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10438409794784152,0.0,0.2916075718897033,0.0,0.0,0.0974018074989977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3669560347760282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2595459291607977,0.0,0.0,0.1021900916300612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11520071010160438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07832030802661279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2317202636799737,0.0,0.13580247730824868,0.16597284305513624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10085288506425234,0.14418931940722868,0.0,0.098045858004097,0.0,0.0,0.11330880993676225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11782574854268126,0.0,0.0889851905403463,0.0,0.0,0.08682897269497952,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,fredleam1,2019/01/29,"There is Hope for Your Addicted Loved Ones (an update) My wife and I have an adult son who's addicted to heroin. He's now in recovery. I've shared here several times in the past about our journey with him for the past almost twelve years. 

He served 33 months in state prison and has been in and out of county jails numerous times. His mother and I prepared ourselves for the ""dreaded"" phone call or knock on the door saying he had overdosed.

Like many parents, we had to make some tough decisions and set some hard boundaries with him. We prepared ourselves (to the extent possible) that we might never see him again. 

I'm pleased to share that he has entered into a fourteen-month drug court treatment program in our county. He's been sober for 8 months, is living on his own, has a job, and is one of only two people in the program to have clean drug tests. 

You can read more in this article - [There is Hope for Your Addicted Loved Ones (an update)](https://moneywithapurpose.com/hope-for-your-addicted-loved-ones/). 

I share it to offer hope and encouragement to parents who think there is none. Maybe hearing our son's story offers hope to those of you fighting this terrible disease who think there's no way out. There is. 

I don't pretend to know what it's like to be addicted. But I have watched what it did to my son. I know how difficult it's been for him to get sober. It's been a long hard road. Now he has to fight to stay sober. He has a long road ahead in recovery. We've seen a change in him we've never seen, not in what he says, but in what he's doing.

addiction,Purplepimpp,2019/01/29,"Addicted to Video games First off, I want to say how I am extremely lucky and grateful for having such a mild problem compared to all the other major addictions. Although this problem is easy and minor I can never shake it off.

I grew up as a kid playing games far too much. Today, my day can never feel complete if I dont get in a video game or a least some TV. When I cut myself off., I relapse for a week.

It's one of those things where, I just cant be mindful of it. I just want it and I dont think twice about it. While I'm at school or work, I always visualize who I could be and that I need to stop playing for that day and focus, but when i get home, it's hard to keep those thoughts up when I get the feeling that I need to play/watch TV. As if I need to relax, when I really dont.

Some of you might be thinking ""Videogames and TV? Is this guy joking?"" But I assure you I've played an average 6-9 hours everyday, chasing my to ditch and fail classes and be late to work. It has heavily impacted my social life, I'm 20 and havent had a friend or at least a acquaintance for 2-3 years.


What can I do with my spare time? I know I can work out, but nothing feels like it's enough to make up for not playing. How do I dig myself out?",1.8747777777777763,2.6741330333333337,3.747592592592593,92.2391666666667,76.07407407407408,6.881481481481483,23.5,7.1686216300943375,0.6224222222222222,949,27,229,10,20,322,146,270,0.077,0.8140000000000001,0.109,0.6298,0,0,0,0,0,1,33.0,0,2,0,5,12,15,1,1,10,0,23,3,0,3,4,52,42,27,0,10,11,0,4,1,1,1,3,1,1,2,19,12,0,2,7,14,0,2,8,5,0,3,2,5,31,10,33,34,8,33,0,1,0,0,11,13,0,9,19,159,50,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26796264664373004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10226431123353087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12886041090880326,0.0,0.0,0.0981272480616437,0.0,0.0,0.1585232478700324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4321206934561773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12699062196050726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18642883518348335,0.0878012148677108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10454038021423258,0.0,0.0,0.09495378196220623,0.0,0.19263367053555305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12169230471878315,0.0,0.0,0.11009605348135312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232807289377644,0.0,0.12103371535991353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1092409464854205,0.0,0.0,0.0675437261972003,0.0,0.13863881161977062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08680931873761175,0.0600437102133163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08203804076123783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303796022013336,0.124095986713332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034711283989937,0.27339083184727003,0.18957920139788187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179277857143655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08328157736172419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23520123549162264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07873416964029009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09773660500675677,0.0,0.1243833875648004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12528311374183576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027515769552372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165062911310683,0.15750128077949674,0.0,0.0975704613922039,0.07166514578479165,0.0,0.116496727450808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449815702566296,0.0,0.09858457276191213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2684223638858096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07914485986143498
addiction,egriffith5,2019/01/29,"Happiness lost                                 Happiness lost


Lost in a slurry of emotions. I turn around to find myself, but instead I find you, standing there in a hue of blue...

    The love hate relationship we have is all I know.  Like silent whispers in the dark telling me to stay but I must go.

    As I await my fate the fire inside grows stronger.

    Like needles in my vein, my life in pieces my body slain.

    Sometimes I dream of a brighter day but maybe I like this, maybe I’ll stay.

    The wind blows cold as my demons get louder. Who knows what’s next, if I live maybe I’ll drown her.

    Wading through my own personal hell; will I make it through, only the future will tell.


    The night grows cold as I’ve lost my way. Shackled by my thoughts I’m tattered and frayed.

    Who else lives here with me? Maybe I’m all alone, I’m starting to feel the fear deep inside my bones.

    Like spears in my chest I just miss home.

    Clouds rolling in, the thunder inside.

    Is this it, have I met my demise?

    I ask these questions, but get no answer. These sick, twisted games, burn like a cancer.

    These thoughts aren’t mine, it’s something more sinister, it’s different this time.

addiction,sillychillibilly,2019/01/29,"4 months clean, and then, relationship ended. I'm hurting right now. Over the past 4 months I've made some strong and difficult changes in my life. I withdrew from daily, multiple drug abuse (cannabis, benzos, and various opiates) which had occuppied my life for near 7 years, I started exercising regularly, doing a little weightlifting, sleeping and eating at the right times of day. I felt so proud of myself, and many members of my family have told me how proud they are of me, too. It's been great, honestly. I'm surprised I even managed to get this far, to be honest.

Today, however, I broke up with my girlfriend. It was a very complex situation but, despite our great connection and love for each other, we just couldn't physically be together. This is mainly due to a few outstanding issues I have yet to resolve. Namely, long-term unemployment, and what some might call social-phobia from having locked myself away in the bedroom of my parent's house for near 12 years.

It was an amicable break up, but the moment that last phonecall ended, it hit me hard. I instantly had, and dismissed, thoughts of using again. I don't think I will do that, but the breakup and the thoughts of using have made all aforementioned feelings of pride disappear into nothingness.

I feel empty, my motivation to exercise has completely disappeared, and I've completely lost my appetite. I tried eating some cereal earlier but I honestly nearly puked. My body is vibrating like it did during my withdrawals. I know time is a great healer, but have any of you experienced a break up soon after getting clean? Do you have any advice or tips for dealing with it? I would honestly appreciate any kind of encouragement or supporting words right now.

Thanks.

addiction,agentOrange088,2019/01/29,"Demons. A poem I Just wrote. Why won’t these demons go away,
They sit and stare at me all day,
They crawl out from the crypt of my cortex,
Spiral me into a negative vortex, 
Just one more time they say,
It’ll just be one day,
But I know better, 
Than to go get her,
So in my comfort of soberness I’ll stay,
And keep fighting this battle day after day.",4.8141891891891895,3.8150216351351385,5.497972972972972,88.59533783783785,69.13513513513513,7.9405405405405425,23.90540540540541,5.985473137389443,0.4410378378378375,267,4,62,1,4,87,56,74,0.12,0.807,0.07400000000000001,-0.5478,0,0,0,0,2,0,12.0,0,0,3,1,4,4,2,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,1,12,9,4,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,3,4,0,1,1,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,1,2,10,2,11,5,2,15,2,0,1,0,7,5,0,0,6,41,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368449976914899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22295137237163634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6503036855397446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317055884983127,0.0,0.28653486792475313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22406741934016508,0.0,0.0,0.13854098585318675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3416427396207217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20047051553014333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686922932411006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469945545993423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22747023275315803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,abc123abc123youme,2019/01/30,"Television addiction... can this be real? I have been an avid lover of television since I was a young child. I started watching tv from the time I was very small. Some of my first memories are rewinding my favourite moments on VHS tapes and watching them on repeat. All through my childhood I was an only child and relied on television for entertainment  because I spent most of my childhood alone either in my home town or overseas in another country. Television followed me through my adolescence watching tv constantly when not in school, or having it on while I was sleeping. When I went to university I still needed tv to fall asleep and found myself either watching tv or videos online. Now I am working and am starting to realize all I do is work and watch tv. I literally can’t not watch it. I wake up early to watch it, it’s all I do at home.often I would rather stay home alone and watch television then socialize. But this evening I was sitting on the couch thinking about wanting to get better at drawing and I literally cannot force myself to turn off the tv series I’ve seen 3 times and focus on something different. What’s worse I don’t WANT to. Please help. Or advise. But I feel like if I’m asking if I’m addicted, I am.

addiction,dawbzy1,2019/01/30,"Alcoholism and the rest. Hey guys. First time poster. I’m pretty sure I’m an alcoholic. 29 yr old, steady job, own my
own business, ups and downs but generally moderately happy. In a fair bit of debt but managing it. I get excited about drinking as much as I can most nights after work and want to stop/cut down. At the weekend i drink a lot more. For example, mid week I’ll finish work at 5pm, go to the shop and buy 8 pint cans then go home and neck them all and then get more but I’ll only do so if my girlfriend is at work. If she’s home I’ll have a few beers/glasses of wine and as soon as I start I’ll be about the next one. I also tend to do a lot of coke on a Saturday/Sunday that my girlfriend used to be into but has distanced herself from in the last year so I’ve become quite private with it. Any help/guidance is appreciated.

addiction,dkran,2019/01/30,"Opiate relapse, advice needed! Recently relapsed on heroin, nowhere near as bad as I used to be. Used to do ~50-100 bags a day. Been doing less than ten a day for about a week. So very short time span relatively. I have 8mg Suboxone and some kratom. When I wanted to stop a couple days ago it seemed like I had minor withdrawal and got scared and used again. Thinking of stopping tomorrow and splitting the Suboxone over two days to make it a little easier, didn't know I had the sub the first time.

Should this be a relatively painless way of doing it? I'm aware that mental struggles will still be there and I can handle that but I'm worried about the physical symptoms since I have work. I know it was a bad idea, but I want to stop before it gets worse, and avoid it having major effects on my life. I have to stop by the weekend at the latest (for my own sanity), and just want to do this as painlessly as possible. I really don't care much about the mental withdrawal, but the physical I need to mitigate hard if I can for work. 
Thanks in advance guys. I'm an idiot, I know better and shouldn't have picked up after a great clean year, but my lack of sleep lately pushed me to a place I regretted very quickly after using.  I need to set this straight before I do any more damage1",4.09525525525526,5.026681590733595,5.193095238095238,83.4588492063492,70.93050193050193,8.381038181038184,25.97190047190047,8.680891452615391,1.727617589017589,1008,30,204,17,18,333,149,259,0.14800000000000002,0.7120000000000001,0.139,-0.5362,0,1,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,6,11,12,1,3,18,0,24,3,1,7,0,43,47,19,0,11,6,0,1,1,0,3,2,0,1,1,11,8,0,5,7,1,0,2,3,7,0,3,6,1,21,5,34,35,7,41,0,1,0,0,1,12,0,3,26,137,32,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433113159251188,0.0946421904666872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260498101548002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17829138088194565,0.0,0.0,0.1817011054012966,0.0,0.0,0.09442642280438712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10885571204733467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11813526396176957,0.0,0.2754226184338981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908156552352668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05578116632765996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08539104077318004,0.11771060502797935,0.0,0.10571576617072063,0.0,0.0,0.09564194443559934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12052654856816901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17602847069409513,0.0,0.12043742803007385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07541244010713884,0.05216079063998295,0.10700822870866733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07126756580262579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21519133640336305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784857701335679,0.2374983473242071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11154842179459533,0.0,0.0,0.1203633522954038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06839744786306147,0.0,0.10541918330115076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068920390494652,0.0,0.0,0.09719634538148283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08831847353775267,0.0,0.10684375240598544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526398205898629,0.3570467897103127,0.0,0.11161568077068552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11097142625506937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09829638383174638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06841175622793641,0.0,0.0,0.12451298069969526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042955001333386,0.0,0.0,0.3688484118354247,0.0,0.17618733025297353,0.1889212035518472,0.08474639465984958,0.08564176400654587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15545478092537893,0.10842671241245594,0.1088043344297446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0687542200639618
addiction,hyrum101,2019/01/30,"Addicted to media and see no solution I'm really addicted to Media. I spend most of my time playing computer games, watching YouTube, and Netflix. When I cut one piece of media out of my life, the others seem to fill its place. I could cut off all media, but that doesn't seem feasible for the 21st century, and it's so extreme that I'd probably relapse. (I've tried it more than once) This addiction is severely affecting my life. Besides the fact that I'm 24 and wasting the years of my prime, I'm going to bed really late almost every night and multiple nights a week I'm not sleeping at all. This has gotten so bad that I've been missing classes at my University and I'm afraid I won't graduate. I don't know what to do. I think the deeper problem is that I have no friends or purpose in life, but I don't know what to do about that either.

addiction,MixedBerryBeesly,2019/01/30,Weird Dreams Following Short Sobriety I’ve been having very odd dreams since my 7 day sobriety from alcohol and marijuana. These dreams feel like I’m drunk or high to the point where I’m stumbling and not remembering things. Has anyone had similar dreams? Usually when I have dreams they are very vivid and I can remember then completely but lately I’ve just felt drunk/high in my dreams. ,5.307083333333331,7.621266652777781,5.151111111111113,79.50500000000002,69.97222222222223,10.355555555555558,27.277777777777786,10.504223727775694,3.1662611111111096,317,11,58,10,6,98,53,72,0.065,0.726,0.209,0.865,0,0,1,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,1,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,7,2,0,0,0,11,12,7,0,0,4,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,3,2,0,4,7,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,5,1,3,9,0,11,0,0,1,0,1,5,0,1,6,28,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22837137012230166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941815982451315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2240516137257598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13781342635740018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804891141064338,0.15266134679731072,0.2051774809982164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4515538898895439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2410534721204212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043989389176808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20200766638920029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.484141931697329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1767679287649246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14196722705984569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.235351145911582,0.3526359570755819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Ancientitalians,2019/01/30,"It really is possible I never thought I could be happy AND sober at the same time but it’s a real thing! After years of opiate and benzo addiction I’m coming up on 7 months sober. I’ve been to 12 rehabs since the age of 18 and I’m now 25. I never thought I’d be sober and excited about life but I am. Don’t let anyone convince you that your too young or old to be free from your addictions because there’s no age limit to this stuff. Ask for help if your struggling and know your not alone. Whatever feeling you are feeling right now, someone has been through it. I am part of a 12 step program which helps me a lot but there are many ways to find this freedom and happiness that I’ve searched for in drugs for so long. Stay strong friends, I Hope everyone has a great day.

addiction,7rashbin,2019/01/31,"Advice I struggle with being empathetic.

My friend is addicted to drinking and probably cocaine as well. He lives with his family(mom/stepdad/little sister).
He was doing very well earlier on when he started working towards one of his goals.  Then he got a warehouse job and his downward spiral began. He constantly talks about his state of mind in a group message we have (5 close friends + me) and won’t do anything to help himself.


Today he sort of broke and left the gm because we roasted him too hard.  
We always poke fun at each other, so it is extremely normal for us, it’s just our banter.

I texted him after he left and he told me he’s “pretty sure” he’s going to AA but he’s not sure yet. 


Is there anything I can do to help convince him??

addiction,nerdofmanytypes,2019/01/31,"My secret addiction and nearly as secret recovery In July of 2017, I made a mistake. I used meth for the first time. Because I’m gay, it isn’t uncommon to come across. Then I used the next week. And then the next. I had all sorts of reasons why. And no one really noticed. I got compliments at work on the days I came in high. It wasn’t until November that I was really called out. And I quit. And then relapsed for a couple days. Then went clean for a while. And that cycle continued through 2018. I am now about 4 months clean, and still feel like it’s as hard as day one sometimes. Most of my friends have no idea I went through any of this. They have no idea. And sometimes I don’t even feel like my addiction is valid because it only lasted a couple of months of frequent use.

addiction,nobody7124,2019/01/31,"I Need Help I am an addict. A junkie. A fiend. I have been since I was 14 or so. It's now been 4 years of drug abuse, and some periods have been very dark indeed, but where I am now i feel is really an all time low. Klonopin, Ativan, Xanax, Heroin, Oxy, Crack, even fucking mouthwash. These are the thing I consume on a daily basis. It's nothing short of a miracle that I haven't died yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't do this anymore. It's pretty ironic, I started using to get rid of my suicidal thoughts and 4 years down the line those same drugs make me have suicidal thoughts all day, every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an extremely high functioning addict. The only thing that would give me away is how sickly and thin I've come to be. So when I break the news to my mom and my girlfriend, they'll be devastated. They think I've been clean for well over a year now. Despite my nightly concoction of heroin, xanax, and klonopin, I often toss and turn for hours worrying about what's going to happen when I tell them. My girlfriend will probably leave, my mother will never trust me again... it's looking pretty bleak. Part of me hopes I die before I get the chance to tell the,

&amp;#x200B;

I digress. I want to get sober, and I want to stay sober. But I don't know where to start. I've never been to rehab, do you think that that would help? I tried to go NA meeting years ago but I stopped going after a couple of meetings. I forget why. I'm less worried about getting off of crack and heroin because I've gone through H withdrawals many many times and even though it's a living nightmare it's something I know I can do. I'm worried about quitting alcohol and benzos though because I heard withdrawals can kill you.

addiction,2150331,2019/01/31,"Friend is falling into addiction Hello. I'll go straight to the point because I really don't want to lose anymore time.

I have a friend of mine, he's my childhood friend and I love him very much. He's not the type to fit in with anyone, and he suffers very much because of this. His family is not abusive but pretty dysfunctional still, and he's a only child.

He began to smoke tobacco some years ago, and I knew he was cutting himself and had a sort of onset of bulimia, but then it didn't got particularly bad and he was able to stop. He then started to drink (a lot). He nearly ended up in the hospital a few times for alcohol poisoning. Then, to try and stop drinking, he began smoking marijuana. He then became addicted to that, and spent all the money he received from his family in pot. Then he told me he really wanted to try something else. I tried as I could to tell him to stop and that he just had to wait until he will be able to get out of his house, since I know the environment in which he lives in contributes a big deal to his mental state.

But I couldn't stop it. We live in different countries now since I go to University, and he still has to finish high school (he's the same age as me).
He recently tried soft drugs, but when he tried cocaine everything went downhill I think. Now he says he nearly can't stop thinking about it even if he tries. He cannot study, and says his parents are of no help at all. They don't see any of this happening right in front of their eyes.

He lives in a very rural city in the middle of nothing. I told him to get help as fast as he can, he always tells me he will but never did (even if he did, I doubt there's someone able to help him where he is. Personal experience).
I asked him how I can help, since at least I feel I can understand him (I've got my own shit going on), but he says he doesn't know how. I understand that, I mean, what can I do through a phone?
I implored him to at least try and finish high school so he could go live somewhere else, but he says it's really hard and exhausting for him.

But I seriously don't want to lose him to this. He has a very beautiful mind and soul and he doesn't deserve to feel this way. I would literally do anything for him to feel better.

Does anybody here know what should I do? Any advice is appreciated.

addiction,desperateaddict,2019/02/01,"Felt I was given bad counseling advice for my marriage and I’m even more addicted to PMO than ever! I am starting to realize I am coming to a complete loss over this problem. My wife and I have been married for over 2 years now and we have 2 daughters. Before we got married, I thought I had a mild addiction to porn and would get over it once we got married and had sex. Boy was I wrong. It got even worst. So about a couple of months into our marriage, she caught me and I confessed to her and tried to change. Installing porn blockers on my personal devices, etc. None of it worked of course because there are so many loop holes to the software. So after a year of our marriage, I enter “recovery”. 12 step groups, recovery work; counseling, etc. It definitely started to help me. I was going from pmo every day/every other day to every 2 weeks and sometimes 30-45 day streaks of being sober. I got a flip phone, threw out my Xbox, and eliminated every source of porn in our home. That’s when I started using my work computer to do pmo. Because of this, my wife started to despair extremely so and we went to a 3 day “intensive”. When we were done with this intensive, I had “consequences” if I ever relapsed again. Because me and my wife didn’t believe in divorce, the consequence was telling my boss I use my work computer to look at porn during work hours. Also that she would separate from me and move in with her parents. Well that was all dandy until I was still addicted and no root issues with my addiction were solved. So I relapsed a month after the intensive and realized I couldn’t tell my boss what I have done and I didn’t want my wife to separate from me. That’s when I begun to lie again about my addiction to my wife. Well, she just found out that I had been lying to her 3 weeks ago. Since then she has moved out and lives with her parents and siblings now. Since then, her dad has berated me, asked me if I’m going to murder his daughter, and many other strange offensive things. They think I am a coward for not telling my boss what I have done and really want me to get fired from my job. I have since made appropriate actions at work to make sure that I cannot access the porn at work such as moving into a public area where everyone can see my monitors. I was also back in school taking some classes for computer science but used the computer I had for class to relapse so I dropped the class and disabled that computer. She won’t talk to me anymore and now wants to get divorced because I won’t get fired at my job and physically destroy the laptop I was using for class even though internet is disabled on it through covenant eyes as in she literally has to call that company for them to turn the internet back on the computer. I just don’t know what to do anymore. At first all she wanted was for me to tell the truth every time I relapsed but ever since I did that she said I relapse too much and love my job and pursuit of my dream more than I love my family. And now I feel like her family is turning her against me and filling her head with doubts and extreme anger. I’m at a total loss now and really need some help and support from Reddit!

Tl;dr wife found my porn addiction and now wants a divorce.

addiction,revengeofthesweets,2019/02/01,"Officially 20 days sober today :) I’ve been abusing adderall, xanax, and alcohol the past year very heavily, and today marks 20 days free of all 3 - and I’m kind of amazed at how clear headed I feel. 

I don’t lose my keys anymore, I remember things that happened days before, and finally - FINALLY I am starting to take care of my self again. 

I’ve been hiking daily, and have lost 10 pounds so far. I’ve visited my doctor, and now see a therapist once a week. Although it’s only 20 days, it’s the longest I have gone in 10 years without adderall - and the longest I have gone without all 3 (adderall, xans, alch) in well over a year. It just feels fucking good.

addiction,Ahmt12,2019/02/01,"Nicotine cravings, years after quitting I quit smoking almost 7 years ago, haven’t had a cigarette since, and this week I’ve been having intense cravings and I don’t know why. I am not unusually stressed, it’s just my brain keeps going back and like fantasizing about the relaxing feeling of nicotine. What the hell. 

Any former smokers ever experience that? I am certainly not going to give in to the craving  because it was so hard to quit in the first place but it’s so weird that I’m having cravings randomly, years later. 

I struggled with other very addictive substances  back then too, but I don’t have cravings for them and I’ve been clean for all this time, just occasional drinking (not frequent or in large amounts either).

2 hours therapy every day. Been clean for 30 days, just started my second month of therapy today.
Haven't had a drink nor any drug at all, the best thing no withdrawal symptoms so far. I am getting a whiff at my new life. More focused every day on my rehabilitation.

addiction,ramenqueenn,2019/02/01,"Can some people avoid addictions to drugs or nicotine by simply being strong willed or whatever you wanna call it? Examples : I have tried quite a few cigarettes in my lifetime but I have never once felt the need or urge, I have never even purchased my own pack by the current age of 25. I occasionally drink alcohol, and even though I have binges like any other 25 year old, I have never needed a drink. I tried cocaine once, I thought it was whack (even though the two people I did it with had been using this supplier for a long time and they love it).  Weed is nice, not addictive (I think it isn't even addictive in the first place?) . Tried acid a couple times, not addictive (are psychedelics even addictive?) . I guess the main thing is cigarettes, alcohol, and trying coke once. I've had people tell me their first-hand experience with cigs and coke was to be addicted. So idk?? Maybe they're predisposed genetically?
Do I just have a strong mind?

addiction,susiesheeps,2019/02/01,"My mom is on drugs again My mom has a history of being addicted to pain killers and other drugs. But she has been going to DACCO for years now, since I was in middle school (I'm 16). I thought this was making her better. But I found out she got kicked out of DACCO and has been hanging out with old friends who also have a bad track record. I was worried about her since she was acting so differently lately, all defensive and always texting people on her phone and making sure nobody sees it. I looked through some messages (which I feel sick about, but I am so worried about her and I was hoping this would prove my suspicions were false) and I saw that she is taking drugs again.
I desperately want to tell somebody. It's killing me inside. But me, my mom, and my 4yr old sister live with my grandpa. And my grandpa said if she ever got into this stuff again, he'd kick her out on the streets. If that happens, I'd be alone taking care of my sister since my mom usually does everything around the house. Plus I'd never forgive myself for doing that to my own mother.
But I want her in rehab or something. Something to take her away from all the drugs and the ""friends"" who keep coming by when she thinks nobody notices. I just want my old mom back. She's the only one I can talk to about my depressing thoughts. If she's not around, I'll be stuck with my grandpa. And he doesn't believe in all the mental stuff, so there's no way he'd ever pay to get me any therapy or mental help.
I feel like I can't tell anybody. I don't want people to get hurt, but I feel that no matter what I choose to do, somebody will get harmed.
I used to trust my mom with nearly everything. But it's like she's not the same person now. I can't look at her the same way. I just wish things in my life were different. I just want everyone to be okay.

addiction,qe71,2019/02/02,"I need help. I have never given it enough personal consideration and certainly have never said it out loud. 

I am an addict. I need help. It’s been about 9 years. 

Adderall, caffeine, nicotine, weed, my phone/social media. And probably something else I am overlooking. 

My mind is suffering. I don’t know who I am without drugs.

My body is suffering. I’m 26. If I don’t stop damaging my body, it will only get worse.

My relationships are suffering. I have trouble connecting with people.

Most importantly, my daughter doesn’t deserve an addict for a mother.

I am lost and scared. 

I cannot continue lying to myself. Everything is not fine. Nothing will improve unless or until I change. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who to talk to. 

I want to be me. But, I’m not sure if I know who that is anymore.

I am an addict. I need help.

addiction,thhhhhhhhhhhhheend,2019/02/02,"Coming to terms with my addiction I’m only 19 years old and I’ve been abusing pain medication and benzos for a few years now, on and off. 
There was genuinely a time where I was prescribed a benzo and I controlled myself, and only took it as needed. That was around a year ago. 
I took this year off school because of some mental health things unrelated, and 3 months ago I started using again. 
I ended up abusing alcohol, then those benzos, more benzos and pain killers, alcohol, and now benzos and pain killers again.
Now, I don’t remember the last 3 months. All my friends left me because of the person drugs made me become. I don’t even recognize myself, anymore. I’ve lost everything. 
Nobody even knows I have a problem. They don’t know I was high or drunk while talking to them, or while doing the things that drove them away. 
I’m just looking for someone to talk to who gets it. Thanks guys, stay safe. Take care of yourselves.",3.4274999999999984,5.578607138888887,3.940833333333334,86.84625000000004,74.83333333333333,6.5,25.13888888888889,7.413659706084162,1.2315555555555555,735,25,140,9,16,231,109,180,0.171,0.765,0.065,-0.9628,0,0,3,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,3,2,11,9,0,0,8,0,10,10,0,3,1,26,28,15,0,2,3,0,0,0,1,0,9,0,0,2,9,12,3,2,3,1,0,4,3,5,0,0,10,1,18,4,17,18,5,36,0,1,1,0,9,9,0,3,22,90,27,1,0.0,0.2632339630351217,0.0,0.12109851428343728,0.0,0.0,0.19693943407318826,0.2374311197877556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11016598616273957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888876656701884,0.0,0.0,0.10436755528335502,0.0,0.0,0.1354321743881364,0.12268411554439948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132580629237545,0.0,0.0,0.09568947060878404,0.0,0.0,0.12459072541538428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12882276640415954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838790560685803,0.0,0.0,0.14674054443667756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998355962139476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582361806946033,0.0,0.05803707244275212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10999113112034033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807764123579882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11736688541954128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209828487808935,0.0905487031686441,0.0,0.0,0.12069364683215353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328301235609388,0.0,0.12126186660759855,0.0,0.0,0.10511085074337756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11190595870716816,0.11194706029032707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17733319462845026,0.0,0.0,0.08236775777044568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11656450844960252,0.0,0.0,0.16896955339301115,0.3546052570011036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09699471075947108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10629287526605644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12583709695915865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1124234562115282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412154615671296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786261890266591,0.11840130905183825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083521728050459,0.17857104516094888,0.0,0.10227169356397632,0.0,0.0,0.1475992269781019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647742720050289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2468379593311621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594135174738933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2861391335676266
addiction,reemisHD1,2019/02/02,"My Grandfather is using and I don't know how to or if I should confront him I recently found out my Grandfather is abusing Cocaine and smoking pot. He has been smoking cigarettes since he was a kid and has no intention of ever quitting. I have a bad habit of being nosy and I had a suspicion that he was smoking pot when I smelled smoke in his house. He lives in the apartment behind mine and there is an entrance to his apartment from my basement. He recently was injured severely at work (he is 65) and broke his pelvis and part of his back. He is lucky to be alive. He is coming back from rehab tomorrow and I had the idea to sneak into his apartment to see once and for all if he really was abusing drugs. After a while of searching I found a straw with white powder in the lining, empty bags of pot, and by his bedside, a pink glass pipe. I know I shouldn't be sneaking around in there, but he has diabetes and has struggled with weight for a long time. I myself and no stranger to drug use but am yet to fall victim to addiction, except the occasional pot habit that comes on and off. In this glass pipe there was residue of what looked to be crack or cocaine inside, with a scorched black underside. I'm worried he may be using stimulants to wake up and get to work during the day. I love my Grandfather and his condition has been worsening over the years. How can I confront him about this without him knowing I was in his apartment? Is it possible? I don't want to ruin my relationship with him especially knowing I might not have a lot of time left. Should I let this be and let him live his life as he wants? I don't want to lose him prematurely but I also don't want him to suffer.

addiction,FallingapartCarl,2019/02/03,"Lost in hell I am not ok.  It's been just over two years since I entered the rabbit hole.  I know when I'm going to use long before I actually use.  The excitement and fear of driving into a city like Kensington or West Philadelphia, where people are murdered damn near daily.
I'm walking down the streets of Kensington.  The L  tracks are overhead giving the impression if being in a tunnel.  But it's freezing.  
I find a hooker.  I'm not interested in sex but SHE can take me to a trap house where I can hide out and score.
We pass a man who has OD'd.  He's dead.  He's just dead on the streets.  And my first thought is ""those are the bags I want!""  The girl agrees.
Six days go by and my family has no idea where I am.  I only stop because someone was wise enough to have my debit and credit cards reported stolen.  I am ok.  I can get out if here.
I turn to crack.  I've gone through the withdrawal from heroin and I don't want that again.  I can handle the crack.  I don't have to travel to Philly.  Here's a trap house close to home.  I'm ok.
I spend two days peeking out of Windows.  The people buying for me, the people I'm freely smoking up are also ripping me off.  
They're probably setting me up.  I'm not ok.  I make it out.
I go back to that same house over and over.  The paranoia appears after just one blast.  But I need it.  I can't be without it.  I'm not ok.
Nineteen days have passed since I've used.  I drive past the trap house every night.  I have money.  I make it to bed one more night.  But I want to use.

addiction,NoPornAgain,2019/02/03,"I Can't Win I have an addiction to pornography. I've been fighting it for 2 years. Every time I fight it, I have maybe 2 weeks (if I'm lucky) of not feeling urges, then I have about a week (if I'm lucky) of fighting urges successfully until I get exhausted from trying so hard to fight urges that are so strong, and the urges become so strong that I start having literal panic attacks. Then I relapse into a binge so hard that I just turn out more addicted than before. Recently, that cycle has gone from a few weeks to a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm just depressed when it comes to porn. I don't think I can win, and I don't see the point in fighting, since every battle just means losing worse than the last time.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't actually want to give up porn. I want porn to leave me alone. I want to be done fighting. But I know that means losing, and that means losing a lot of religious and cultural opportunities ahead.",4.8364285714285735,5.280056730158734,5.474193121693124,83.86779761904762,69.0,8.628042328042326,26.86111111111111,8.59863814320734,1.661257142857143,738,21,154,11,12,239,102,189,0.29100000000000004,0.638,0.071,-0.9867,0,1,0,0,10,0,31.0,0,0,0,10,9,22,8,1,9,0,14,6,0,0,0,26,33,15,0,5,7,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,10,7,0,0,6,0,0,2,5,14,0,0,3,4,17,8,23,29,4,24,0,4,1,3,8,7,0,5,15,95,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.1059568519993862,0.2367329571063486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11245447285807003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352892936831115,0.26386927158741136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12352360048226806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11991630795248705,0.09239221792852344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09353067407639007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09351841348391574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11111339685330887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829639633720193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05490049949829549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05672773056905792,0.10415829133702664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19452983192117812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069278487341394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05967184694180176,0.08850588461013807,0.0,0.11496884401722313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3644143559687282,0.0,0.09230946958818337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10908159283934102,0.3548211126941627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12739335333433865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052833599609904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072080671814931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08652292402200527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08981717129560565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07685234762962534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06957265203560417,0.0,0.0,0.12662587189361355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07371760369808092,0.11810211591637608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921270536173265,0.0,0.2612851200789502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11065066176674096,0.0,0.0,0.26386927158741136,0.06992092722414323
addiction,lakefoster,2019/02/03,"Losing a loved one Hey guys. I was browsing through this thread the other night and came across a post about someone’s struggle with duster and that kind of inspired me to share my story. I’m 17 years old, but i’ve experienced enough in my lifetime to be 60. My mom used to tell me that. She was the most important person in my life and my complete guardian. She was always the one to give me that advice i needed or that push to do something i was too nervous to. We were always a lot closer than her and my brother were, and we were always there for each other. She struggled hard with addiction and I sat back and watched her spiral out of control. I lived with her and multiple times I saw her look at me blankly like she didn’t know who I was. Multiple times I had to watch her piece of shit boyfriend yell at her over some drug fueled rage. I was too young to do anything about it. Her main drug of choice was duster. She did many other drugs but this is ultimately what led her to the decisions she made.  When she did duster she was a completely new person. She was very evil and manipulative. It was almost like she was possessed. Even her voice changed drastically and her eyes became a bit more sunken. I lived with her and a piece of shit of a man for a while. During this time she was always on some sort of drug, neglecting me and my brother leaving me and my grandmother to take care of us. Eventually we moved out with my dad. After Jail time and many other embarrassing events, including her coming to my football game and having a seizure in front of the entire crowd, she finally sobered up. She went to a rehab and I honestly saw the old mom I had. She was so loving and caring for me and my brother and she always made sure we were the first priority. She was the best and most inspiring human in my life. Everyone around her loved her and saw a real change. But about two years later I Gave her a call after she failed to pick me and my brother up and I heard thag same demonic sound in her voice. I immediately started crying and hung the phone up, conflicted on whether to tell anyone or not because I did not want to stop seeing her. I thought i could help her. I told no one. We talked aboht it for a long time and she told me everything was alright and convinced me it was a one time thing. I believed her. I called her again one day and heard the same exact sound. I was heartbroken and I finally told my dad. I was so sad because he said i couldn’t see her anymore. My mom knew i wouldn’t be able to see her anymore and I believe this is what sent her over the edge. The worst part is the whole time she was begging me not to tell anyone. I felt like absolute shit. The day after i told my dad i got a text from her telling me how much she loved me. It didn’t seem out of the blue because she did this often. I didn’t think much of it and told her I loved her too. The next day my uncle called me sobbing. I couldn’t even make the words out. He hung up quickly realizing how confused I was and about that time my dad walked in with big tears in his eyes. I immediately knew. She was found in her car with 14x the usual amount of duster to get high in her system. That was two years ago. I can truly say I have never been the same since then. It’s so hard to experience and i have never talked about it openly until now. I just felt the overwhelming need to share this with someone, even if only one person reads this. I’m sorry this was so long and not formatted well, being i’m on mobile. I urge anyone struggling with addiction to think of the ones around you. You’re not only hurting yourself, but you are severely impacting the lives around you even if you don’t feel like you are. Addiction is a disease, but it is one you can battle. I wish the best of luck to all of you out there, and to anyone struggling just know you can do this and everyone here wants to see you accomplish that.

addiction,wolphin,2019/02/03,"4 months coke free. Will it get better? So yes. I've done it. It was hard. My usage was so bad that I had to another city to quit. I don't have many friends here. I'm okay with that at the moment.

It was easier in a sense that I didn't know anyone who does drugs here. 

I had a question for former addicts - does it get better? I have random cravings still. I avoid any social triggers so that's probably good. My main question is will I ever be my old self again? Will my brain recover or atleast close to what I was? Will I feel again? I know everyone is different but at this point anecdotal evidence will suffice. 

Thanks. Sorry about the English. It's not my native language. 

One last thing though: Fuck cocaine. It starts out as a fun party drug. You feel invincible. You feel like you're the king of the world. But before you know it it changes you into an asshole. Please if you're reading this now - quit immediately. It's not worth it. I did blow for about 7 years. It started out maybe once or twice a month. But at the last month before I quit, I was doing 5-6gms a week.",0.049034690799395264,2.398549778280543,1.8060769230769265,95.23475641025642,91.94117647058823,4.756621417797888,18.226395173454,6.42735559955562,-0.06695849170437418,835,24,183,10,30,272,131,221,0.07,0.7659999999999999,0.165,0.9693,1,1,3,0,0,0,34.0,0,4,0,6,13,12,1,1,11,2,22,6,1,1,1,25,35,11,0,1,8,0,4,1,1,5,3,0,0,1,21,5,1,1,8,1,2,0,4,3,0,2,10,4,22,10,17,19,1,27,0,0,0,1,10,10,1,6,18,115,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12473852867135195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07781191880031102,0.11998303972729785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000758715490801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09553886150747283,0.0,0.0,0.1947319792893822,0.0,0.0,0.20239661359576014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12773449283138974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12104491439928305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11954822682390462,0.0,0.0,0.2002655906104668,0.11709499014056868,0.0,0.0,0.2653899172209071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350262663971074,0.0,0.10933657891054603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735679124980446,0.08174418707482745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840332936025737,0.1057827024160312,0.11956313531571892,0.0,0.0,0.09597302157805412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10250100076109098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18865252599228025,0.186540884885166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05590155315890818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1160074919610685,0.11495380754944308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2739952911078214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200682383705466,0.12185731669203227,0.07753633990145485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12560266656339653,0.10816721336667134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12336790981059745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25636106368474315,0.36511050137504975,0.11445448676327935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11936868842779705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166403711208298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280877650363332,0.16197911580096835,0.0,0.09137877258242752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10534580589518093,0.0,0.0,0.07601790375059735,0.0,0.11242052953587188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178364753475983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736849967312169
addiction,dawn990,2019/02/03,"4 days in and needing some advice I'm not gonna write my entire story because I don't feel like it's relevant just keep in mind it's not as easy as it may seem. (Also, I am aware that others have it worse)

This is my second attempt in getting off of xanax (prescribed). Well, technically it's my third attempt. First time I managed to lower my dose and stay on it for 3 more years. Second time I managed to stay ""clean"" for two years. 

I started using it (prescribed) again in summer of 2017 (I was literally waiting for my two-year-mark and then soon after took it). For next year it was really sporadic use and I do need it for my anxiety. At end of November/beginning of December of 2018 things started to go out of my control. I started to use it for everything and anything. My tolerance grew and it stopped producing ""buzz"" I wanted. 

So I decided to stop. I did it 3 or 4 days ago. I'm a hot mess right now. This time I don't think I have same will power. Last time I was so proud with every day that went by and now I just miss that feeling it produced. That's all I feel... Difference being that last time I stoped using it I didn't experience any ""buzz"" it just helped get rid of my anxiety.

For the most part I'm good. I stoped using on a low dose and after 2 months of abusing it so it's not that big of a deal. It could be worse. Last time I was battling 5 years old addiction.

I don't feel any special physical symptoms anymore. I do sleep a lot but that is common for me (and it's a fucking blessing!). But anger. Motherfucking anger. I feel so tense, so anxious, so mad. I feel angry. Like - I wanna punch a wall angry. Angry to the point of angry tears because I can't help myself calm down - I know what would help and it just makes me even more angry. I don't have a reason to be angry I just am.

Today is specially hard. Like really really hard. I'm super pissed. Weather changes affect my mood and weather here is out of control.

It's only 3pm and I don't know what the fuck should I do?! I can't focus, everything is boring. At the end of the day I feel claustrophobic and trapped. I'm on a verge of a panic attack majority of the time.

I don't have anyone to talk to about this actually because if I were to mention it that would mean that it's a real problem or I would get mocked for making up problems. This is first time I'm talking about it since I even noticed that it's starting to be a problem, I kept quiet while I knew I was making it worse and now that I want to be clean it's... I just don't have people around me to talk to about this. 

Same day I stoped taking it I also started to exercise. So far it does nothing for me, but having that healthy habit makes me a bit proud of myself. I'm trying to change for the better and not hide behind a pill. Yes, it has it up side and it has it's purpose. I abused it which makes that purpose unimportant. 

I know that I sound like a pussy with my addiction that's zero compared to what other people got going on, but please keep in mind that this is a lot for me.",0.7996099674972896,2.8041988153364628,2.9801502347417888,91.20606500541712,82.75586854460093,5.685046346454798,21.098374864572047,6.8785474669866105,0.44255438064283137,2349,72,515,28,65,798,262,639,0.223,0.7070000000000001,0.07,-0.9986,2,1,0,0,1,0,83.0,0,0,0,13,28,32,9,1,22,1,49,12,2,16,1,100,106,36,0,14,17,0,10,4,0,7,8,2,2,0,64,21,0,8,16,1,0,5,14,17,1,7,13,12,66,14,74,80,12,80,1,2,0,2,9,26,3,9,51,345,130,4,0.0,0.14561431228755672,0.05996547465381435,0.13397721686904684,0.0,0.060047366551377886,0.05447093514114988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09828167431702298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357501432113812,0.0,0.09401681356895024,0.06942001211290158,0.060941012807026934,0.04296665180196285,0.0,0.050567387995831735,0.05470274264989098,0.0,0.06990724237362435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11237643525033487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05434675092393396,0.0670865212574068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001003715616608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13784082106721454,0.049062120258115516,0.0,0.0,0.19814798652614696,0.06335134204291124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06420124913327904,0.0,0.0,0.05377453692619272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10885135829105876,0.0,0.0,0.08117312529309723,0.0,0.05177353187224645,0.0,0.11045300930695276,0.060109028192043785,0.0,0.0,0.21749364145096534,0.043899261904727566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104537176109897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361743812071574,0.09631388321050603,0.0,0.06984589927606097,0.051540604424708696,0.049146472843191236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11009267909873112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12356414474349753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923759831135092,0.0,0.0,0.10131248402950754,0.15026769709051185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008373981418745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044836847159129,0.0,0.0,0.2050888158526338,0.0,0.0,0.06693610351259861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12409218324056635,0.0,0.04904809942425993,0.0,0.0,0.09112748419026176,0.0,0.0,0.06535183371225073,0.0,0.0,0.05896208564675976,0.06996022769060285,0.06448051208635756,0.0,0.0,0.04673482295211294,0.0,0.0720972995732164,0.0,0.06654340620797257,0.0,0.08520216198231312,0.0,0.0,0.06745267832135146,0.05808927825952175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17639552002872155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06994254877369284,0.11809763472286885,0.06317992724784319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247721069387305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05594096881237239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05083134509163356,0.0,0.061493495436287814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21747000863602126,0.13099316663199373,0.0,0.10274842767672362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06386916165247086,0.04620208901202169,0.14817141927148916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04082406328343671,0.03937411336327579,0.0,0.0,0.2866517971522073,0.0,0.058246578445549736,0.0,0.06827223068034613,0.041719917236903284,0.0,0.12005371801441005,0.0,0.0,0.2653615398551493,0.0,0.0,0.07248856332618969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05525013648132944,0.05696394766465904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878657017945303,0.13095507028447367,0.0,0.0,0.1978560852890782
addiction,jrvaldez85,2019/02/03,"Having a candid conversation with a loved one Last night I had a conversation with my long term boyfriend in which he admitted to me that he believes that I don't have an addiction. That's fine, he can have his own opinions,  but his reasoning is what got me. 

He said that when he thinks of an addict, he sees someone who is ""fiending"" for the next fix. I can totally see his perspective,  but I wanted him to see it from mine as well.

I sat there and told him that, at that point and time, I wanted to do it even if my usual trigger wasn't happening.  I described what it was like to feel it, why I craved it, all for the simple reason liking it, wanting it. I told him what it was it was like, what I was like, in high school and how a few months ago I couldn't stop.

I told him that in the end it wasn't up to him whether I was an addict or not, it was up to me. I am an addict.

But the absolute worst part about it all, having to sit there and describe what it's like, what it feels like physically, psychologically,  and emotionally made me want it even more. It was a hard day and an even harder night. Day 20, no relapse.",4.94527004909984,4.205308659574474,5.921276595744683,84.8069230769231,68.78723404255321,9.273322422258591,27.86415711947627,8.617729084823388,1.6080572831423892,865,23,201,12,13,288,118,235,0.044,0.8240000000000001,0.132,0.9504,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,0,9,10,0,0,14,0,22,5,0,5,3,34,42,15,0,6,7,0,3,6,0,0,4,1,0,0,31,8,0,1,6,0,0,0,6,1,1,1,17,7,29,9,21,24,9,24,0,0,3,1,23,8,0,3,21,148,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4763215110880677,0.0,0.0,0.09682869499436116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12306847903913296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.140892833224688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287271607227072,0.09674824697221417,0.0,0.0,0.21644261578336615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046323756590512,0.07803626338405305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736381735783727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09659461182990556,0.0,0.09785154613134188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11541093742052222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08903968676982442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201951220257145,0.0,0.0,0.09666799849063287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858728267717813,0.1033591525752632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08718894667216667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11617081214868512,0.20501603130572868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07401928453758701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11828897680756136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10326073882261368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22461996987548666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10390584524267768,0.0,0.0,0.11054989167555447,0.2611342992818197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09255298745114857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09132389722040694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06999226291317805,0.0,0.0,0.06369479283794299,0.0,0.0,0.313131185520179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203050044781764,0.0,0.2577144295651571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982138199001836,0.0,0.0985660277790719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I havent played in almost 3 days and its a constant struggle with my self to not reinstall my games and go back to my old habits.

addiction,avadakedavra394,2019/02/04,"My boyfriend is an alcoholic and it’s making me lose my mind. I’ve basically been surrounded by addiction my whole life so I know it’s so hard to overcome that demon. I think I just forgot how hard it is to love someone with an addiction. I’m trying to be supportive. I make sure he goes to his counseling, keeps up with his meetings, and he knows he has a problem and he wants to change. I’ve even dabbled with al-anon and I understand I can’t control him and I can’t make him get the help he needs, but I’m anxious all day every day because I’m afraid he is going to drink and it’s starting to really effect my job and the rest of my life. I’ve never cried so much in my life. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, or just a space to vent, or even for someone who just understands. I just don’t want to give up on him.

addiction,31518148212,2019/02/04,How to turn back before it gets bad again I recently started getting back into some heavy drugs the past few weekends. It just escalated really fast and now that’s all I do when I’m not at work. I had problems in The past where they basically ruled my life and were all I focused on. I still feel like I’m at the point where I could easily stop but idk how or where to put that focus on. I don’t really have anyone in my life that would really care about this let alone to talk to. Is there an easy way to distract myself? ,2.2793838383838363,3.74768000909091,3.873030303030305,89.0639898989899,76.18181818181819,7.4343434343434325,20.404040404040398,8.167268648758528,0.7261919191919192,411,9,92,7,9,137,77,110,0.11,0.769,0.121,0.5006,0,1,1,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,1,14,5,0,1,4,0,9,3,0,2,2,17,17,7,0,3,4,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,6,3,0,1,1,1,0,1,2,3,0,0,2,1,11,2,13,12,4,26,0,0,0,0,2,11,0,2,14,65,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1891782878034396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277185090091037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809049889924772,0.15251154769280093,0.0,0.0,0.1554282470928501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18623169597338665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14583730836354347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118249389765808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09235722004361167,0.1304906955029672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19086221592223807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.186779871005755,0.2580330669746931,0.08923732454180039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.348734880591504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17267056420677712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17477874792906736,0.0,0.18362143625857255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3510455944723512,0.0,0.1803524401711295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292860583375533,0.0,0.1458706730739558,0.1527100138775693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14681333820114614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1986791232681504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449851781619959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.132976979133239,0.0,0.0,0.129754787511364,0.0,0.0,0.0

He wants to mess around sexually but then gets disinterested bc he's more.focused on that and can't get it up anyway and it's reallyaffecting my everyday life bc I go to bed angry and wake up angry and some days I can't deal and have a mental breakdown ,1.5786545454545475,3.993611120000004,3.4134545454545484,86.78172727272732,82.8,6.036363636363637,21.090909090909093,7.348242739294969,0.7464,392,12,80,6,11,131,68,100,0.14300000000000002,0.807,0.05,-0.8985,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,5,4,0,0,2,0,6,2,1,0,0,12,15,9,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,5,7,0,0,0,0,2,1,5,1,0,0,0,1,8,3,9,15,1,15,0,0,1,0,7,7,0,1,5,44,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2403961459591457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21578782335091826,0.2266117316191943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563282593982682,0.2499042560497024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27266791917631594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042328630833964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799327457763412,0.0,0.137761781627952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17121463104170678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2442826754666027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2274764343169549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4582936177761463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750731975648465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429740863095906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17647043990351222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I can feel the toll on my physical health already. My tongue is white, sore, and dry. My stomach hurts. My appetite is always gone. And other shit basically I always feel like crap. Along that comes the mental issues which don’t help. Not gonna go through the specific incidents because it doesn’t matter.

addiction,throwawayy_lmaooooo,2019/02/05,"S/o struggling with meth The other day my significant other told me that they have used meth about 2-3 times a week for the last few weeks.. They had done it “casually” (as casually as one can do meth) about 10-12 times for a few years, having not done it for a year until this past month. I was with them this weekend (not at their residence, which is where their stuff is) and they told me that they were scared of falling into a deeper problem, and that they would throw everything away and seek out help when they got home. They are currently already seeing a therapist for other depression-related issues. 

I’m really proud of them for telling me so early on, and I told them that if they need anything to just let me know. I’ve never faced addiction myself and have never had to have it hit so close to home for me, minus a handful of my friends who have smoke/have quit cigs. Because my s/o told me early and is already seeing someone, is there a better chance that this issue won’t get worse for them?

addiction,Derpy_Mermaid,2019/02/05,"About to start treatment and I’m so nervous. I could really use some advice! Hi, I’ve been addicted to painkillers for almost 12 years and recently, I finally decided to reach out for help. I start treatment in two days time. I’m absolutely terrified. I keep switching between feeling ready to fight my addiction, to not wanting stop and so on, so on. Now today, all I’ve done is panic. I’m worried about whether or not I’m strong enough to get through this and I’m worried about the treatment drug itself. They’re starting me on 4mg buprenorphine on my first day then 6mg the day after. I’m currently taking 1800mg gabapentin and 100mg quetiapine daily, for physical and mental health issues I have. I’ve read that those meds can have bad results mixed with buprenorphine, especially the gabapentin. My dr knows what I’m taking but didn’t mention any concerns about risks at all. I’ve had things overlooked by dr’s in the past and suffered for it so, understandably, it’s making me increasingly anxious. Do you think I’ll be ok? Also, how did buprenorphine make you feel?

addiction,crystalb4ll,2019/02/05,"Admitting I am addicted to meth. I've always had a lot of self control when it came to drugs, meth however is very different. I come from a family of addicts, and I have experienced the devastating effects of drug addiction first hand, yet I still continue to use. I'm wrecking myself, and my relationships with those that I love. I'm sitting back watching my body, mind and spirit decay. I remember watching an anti meth psa video when I was younger and thinking ""why would anyone want to do that to themselves"" yet here I am at 17 going down that exact same path. I am ashamed. As of recently, all of my dreams and aspirations have gone out the window and I'm feeling quite hopeless. I don't have much support from my family and I know they would be ashamed if they found out. If anyone wants to talk that can relate that would be really nice I'm feeling really alone in this.",3.440526315789473,5.535845684210528,4.796350877192981,80.97978947368424,74.6140350877193,8.302690058479532,27.774269005847955,9.029198982220553,2.460261286549707,696,28,131,16,15,231,107,171,0.131,0.762,0.108,-0.7312,2,1,5,0,0,1,18.0,0,0,2,4,7,7,0,2,5,0,17,8,2,3,2,34,36,12,0,7,2,0,3,0,0,3,5,0,1,1,8,12,0,1,8,2,0,4,1,4,0,1,5,6,18,3,20,26,4,20,1,1,2,1,7,5,0,3,10,89,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4422970368347933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14006859805779368,0.0,0.0,0.11253111182738576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1891269099710246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039917647327942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15022195058587473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15467935360049487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11649790408794965,0.0,0.0,0.15168396572106346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14129776647272171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3136725951019832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25498582686064103,0.0,0.1367635417597711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150356861984906,0.0,0.14828446751366536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07686041703408558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07432476212134599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497682274491687,0.12206002873452113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13655457304433447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994174892064848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438451513965755,0.0,0.0,0.17327733481126262,0.0,0.13353389410797342,0.14519791940726007,0.15320137063135092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410855644598599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800341261384573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15346956485240273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870136682591004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665679173196582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11680455877566097,0.0,0.11158775644257096,0.1595369596554752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12203371323618152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2882133788559412,0.0,0.0,0.0

Well things went to shit in 2016 when the oil industry basically crashed and was laid off. Therefore lost medical insurance and no longer could afford the medication.

addiction,Looktothefuture1990,2019/02/05,"Understanding Addiction Hello,

My partner is addict and we are on the verge of splitting up. I want to understand them and the journey they are going through. I was hoping that someone who has experienced this process could guide me. There is somethings which I sort of get.

To begin with my partner is the most beautiful person in the world physically and personality wise. They were expected to achieve so much. So it destroys me to see them this way. They have been drinking for 5 years, the last 2 years have been very heavy. It is now a full addiction.

They have detoxed once and have successfully been sober for a year. But after testing the waters he is derailed.

What I don't understand is he seems to want to stop. He will try stopping by reducing him alcohol levels everyday (well he tries but I'm not convinced). When we suggest doing other alternatives he refuses even when he is in immense pain. I don't understand this. 

I don't understand why he keeps insisting on trying a technique which has not been successful before,  why he keeps wanting this to work despite those hurt around them, and why he refuses anything that might be more helpful to helping to stop (like medication).

People say you need to want to stop, and he seems to want to stop. But he doesn't seem to be trying to most effective way.

Can someone help explain this thinking?",4.539058441558441,6.885539146825397,4.985209235209236,79.72292207792209,72.21428571428572,8.232611832611832,31.29581529581529,8.97023862654752,2.9012317460317463,1083,50,191,23,22,344,145,252,0.08900000000000001,0.79,0.122,0.7898,0,0,3,0,0,0,28.0,2,1,7,5,9,10,1,0,9,0,32,9,0,1,0,48,56,13,0,9,5,0,0,1,2,2,7,1,0,4,15,10,3,9,11,1,0,2,6,3,1,0,6,3,21,7,29,45,5,29,0,1,1,0,36,10,0,8,16,130,36,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2927880805942419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09567555011904108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07367187157119523,0.07969668972079609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617962022072798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07147883974082986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08770092292619279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05913075895989073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046773387062510115,0.0,0.05087941383945674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18002119870415098,0.0,0.0,0.0889190375679586,0.0,0.0,0.09583891645171357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15914878407805105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07297524432323846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043737644992207614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09018753877316424,0.0,0.0949724248393048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06581155517245292,0.06638203571464361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09534175270637897,0.0,0.0,0.0952614610053717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06206572045669589,0.1563404547617054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07119428358677783,0.0,0.0,0.07134024531679084,0.24450200217498186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15170935831239127,0.06892111601113805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3742367001715508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05736433574872494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431277949251709,0.0,0.0,0.465996097034339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07386792654195776,0.2640223442126229,0.14212237500712974,0.0,0.0,0.08049419043512847,0.0,0.2423485600665843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06517564186655371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17295449121712134
addiction,Guitarsark,2019/02/05,"just left r/leaves cause I'm anti-pot Hi everyone. I am a recovering alcoholic and addict (from all substances including alcohol,pot) for 30 years. I have had 2 short pot slips, the second one was recent and IMO due to the legalization and pro pot agenda going on in my state. However when I shared about this to help others on r/leaves I got modded out since r/leaves is a pro-pot sub. Just wanting to vent. Hoping this sub takes addiction a little more seriously and acknowledges the fact that all of the pro pot agenda does have an effect on us recovering addicts. MJ is a drug just like all the others. Most drugs are developed for medicinal purposes and are used that way before they become abused. The same is happening with MJ, it's epidemic but everyone seems to be in denial at the moment.

addiction,ItZace,2019/02/05,"7 days clean...do you have any tips to remain that way?[cannabis] Hello everyone! I am 23 years old and I began to smoke weed at the age of 16 and the amount i smoked daily increased up to 2-3 grams at the age of 22. On top of that me and my friends got into our local techno/ drum&amp;bass scene and I started doing Amphetamine, Mdma and Coke on a regular (weekend) basis. About 6 Month ago I started to realise, how many problems (family/relationship/bisexuality) I was trying to forget by doing those drugs. So i felt worse and worse everytime i called my dealer until i decided to quit. I failed twice already, but i managed to stay away from it for the last week... Since basicly 90% of my friends are smoking weed or do other drugs, I was completly avoiding to meet any of them, but like that i am just on my own and kinda depressive...
So what I really need is some advice on how I should deal with my friends, because most of them are childhood/teenage friends I really don't want to loose...
I appreciate any adivise on either that our anything that you think i should do in my current situation",5.816843997124369,6.14104938317757,6.600093457943928,77.06298705966934,66.85046728971963,9.201437814521928,32.81667864845435,9.057496981413335,2.7738178289000723,864,35,163,14,13,286,136,214,0.069,0.8140000000000001,0.116,0.9163,1,1,4,0,0,0,38.0,2,2,2,3,6,9,0,1,5,0,15,3,0,2,0,29,23,15,0,5,5,0,1,1,4,2,2,0,0,0,9,9,1,1,3,2,0,1,1,4,0,1,5,1,31,5,32,16,6,30,0,2,0,0,14,13,0,4,16,112,40,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339710687105107,0.12152954931465365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15129160530797148,0.0,0.0,0.14854616883347133,0.0,0.2796950464893164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11282038498564552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12880855493821208,0.0,0.0,0.08357397386435649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13999289831538836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437451701604627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841719143513259,0.14134253482160694,0.11808273824077745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3179814711307901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13100349317884424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13163606112332502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4236878479363704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965019564214903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11175357681816173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06697940260168009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13899636181456204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10943071570782656,0.0,0.0,0.10165680151371596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438618146196138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13118475014650385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14582113187555645,0.0,0.0,0.17565762102677038,0.0,0.0,0.14719248266887738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134092969771154,0.15410445961557984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19407804966449912,0.1461287608045778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878471838110245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09308088297194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08086424814142262,0.1088224088883326,0.1099721480547402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794301708682876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828693985897207

7165450087


So a few weeks ago I met this guy and a few dates in he shared he is a recovering Xanax and cocaine addict. He is in his early 20s and struggled during high school with addiction. He’s gone to rehab and has been out for a while. He shared that he hasn’t done Xanax for a year, but that he  “can’t say the same about cocaine unfortunately.”  He also smokes a lot of weed and gets wasted often. I really like him a lot and want to be supportive, but I don’t know a lot about this arena. I tried to talk with him very gently about it because he asked me to share my honest feelings and worries, so I explained I’m worried about his current substance use. He got extremely defensive and aggressive and flipped it back on me. I guess I’m just lost, he doesn’t want anything to do with me because of that conversation (which he told me to be honest about). I just feel like a bad person.",4.230396634615381,5.010937432291668,5.165833333333335,84.33173076923079,70.51041666666666,7.991025641025642,27.26923076923077,8.139509932561175,1.5836341346153842,745,24,155,10,13,244,108,192,0.135,0.7,0.165,0.633,1,0,3,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,1,12,14,2,1,11,0,12,5,0,1,0,31,30,15,0,2,4,0,2,2,0,0,5,1,0,2,9,13,0,1,4,0,0,1,4,6,0,0,7,3,17,8,22,21,6,15,0,1,0,0,28,5,0,5,11,96,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4689753805310396,0.0,0.0,0.1271137891087421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11467543186118695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180044417601016,0.0,0.13405789318317904,0.0,0.0,0.11026430967447994,0.1197314478753069,0.1748283367902262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14674607261651812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14501280519208734,0.10244365192789633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07491960380301656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1146885833378783,0.0,0.15796920581506105,0.14198669261806712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1515079962708247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07880786145026067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14011416490808798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565359970838791,0.3657358836377732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12520971501889158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09186451328281167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11403594766897253,0.0,0.14512656209256006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14991085938260856,0.0,0.0,0.16272649731422942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11525798417335245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13702305734162926,0.0,0.097357916612664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384994209227908,0.0,0.11831847419725465,0.1691598634678123,0.0,0.11502532934992188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29125552118750725,0.0,0.0,0.15678334292057794,0.0,0.09234369350974303

He’s had wicked stomach pains the past 4 days. (7 pain scale off of 10 being most painful). 

Is there any home relief he could be trying? We’ve tried; Tylenol, ginger, tumeric drinks, tonics, IBP with codeine, weed (eating cbd and smoking) kratom oddly (but in very small doses, afraid it will worsen the stomach pain).

It was so bad 2 days ago, he went to emergency. He has been throwing everything up and can’t sleep through it. Ended up getting so dehydrated he had to be hooked up to a saline solution. They also gave him 10mg or morphine. Which may have slightly extended his withdrawal symptoms after temporary relief. (?)
They also said smoking marijuana can cause intestinal irritation. So he’s stopped smoking and gone to eating it some. 

He is also currently on 1.25 of benzodiazepines &amp; SSRI daily. Tapering the past year.

He also has been on off kratom. For kicking the Dilaudids (hydromorphone). But has been worried if May make stomach aches worse.
~
Questions are: 
•Insight into the withdrawal timelines with these particular drugs interactions?
•Home relief for stomach pains?
•Can kratom help or make the pain it worse? 
•Are his other medications prolonging the withdrawals?

addiction,iuksb,2019/02/05,"Withdrawal, cravings, and don't know how to stop Hello,

So the past 2 years I have done - on and off - multiple drugs, especially research chemicals stims, and especially the past few months, but also some benzos and phenibut. 

I always did it without my SO being aware of it and felt bad for it so 2,5 weeks ago I decided to stop, at least the stims and benzos. 

However on friday I found an empty bag of stims and this probably reminded me the ""good times"" (or what my memory is, in fact it was not so good) of my sessions where I would usually mix drugs and porn. 

Since that day I had vivid dreams of using and today the cravings are insane. I nearly went out to get some this morning and now I am fighting the craving.

The first weeks of stopping have been relatively manageable without craving but now, wow it's hard. This is mostly psychological, but it is so hard. 

I have tons of things to do to keep my mind busy but still all I can think of is that. 

This is hard.

addiction,mrshaokahn,2019/02/05,"1 year after I admitted that I was addicted 1 year ago a seek help in this subreddit, it was a very low point of my life. I couldn't work properly and I had a very low self-esteem mostly due to failing to quit my bad behavior. It's important to say that I didn't have any drug addiction, but I seem to have a very addictive personality. One year ago I was trying to do home office, but I'd spend all my day with bullshit on the internet and porn.

Today I am a few months clean from porn (with many fails until this), lighter and more confident due to workout for the past 10 months and with a new job that pays me less but I don't do home office. I really better now, but I still struggle a lot with so many things. But in the end, I feel that things are getting better day by day, but I also find very hard to accept that maybe I'll struggle to the rest of my life with porn and some obsessions.

If could, I'd to tell my 1-year ago self that ""celebrates all small achievements, like your 1st week at the gym, your 1st week without porn and etc. Keep strong and in the future things will be better.""

Is there anything you guys might be able to help me think of to give them a special day or a special something to make them feel really good about the hard work they've done this past year?

addiction,for-audio,2019/02/06,"So I might be addicted to codeine... So I was prescribed cocodomal for a bad hip for a bit and my mum always has prescribed cocodomal and weaker over the counter stuff, she'd lend me the weak over the counter stuff every so often for various things. This was over half a year ago.

Now every week I am having to buy a new over the counter pack of 30 which is £7 and they're gone in a few days. I take 4 every night to sleep, I take them before work to feel relaxed.

I tell myself to stop buying them, trying to minimise how many I take but it's like as I'm saying it I'm taking more.

I'm going to the doctors soon for really bad leg ache and part of me is hoping I'm getting more prescribed cocodomal.

I have to circulate different pharmacies around town to avoid them cutting me off.

Its costing me a lot of money, I'm worried about the amount of paracetamol I'm oding on. I know it's a tiny amount of the drug but I'm growing more and more concerned, am I overreacting?

Tldr: was prescribed cocodomal, now I can't stop buying it",3.0850700934579436,4.242573710280375,4.07297897196262,89.68367406542058,73.57943925233644,6.845327102803737,26.45911214953271,7.1686216300943375,1.107608411214954,810,28,175,8,16,262,120,214,0.129,0.8170000000000001,0.054000000000000006,-0.9238,1,1,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,3,1,10,8,1,1,14,0,14,7,3,1,0,18,31,12,0,1,2,1,1,1,0,1,4,1,0,0,10,6,0,3,2,1,5,3,1,5,0,1,4,2,21,3,28,24,11,23,0,0,0,0,7,9,0,4,12,110,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15400642244503054,0.0,0.0,0.12522836411094151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11754892642048588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576128822970428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359110440368105,0.0,0.0,0.12021135644870395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15423152345721985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09110821446427053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14759829957033144,0.0,0.14459702372572905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.163829700973383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35708114889930537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07143094583471446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07380835305023879,0.0,0.08028765876272845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403141429320114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07763893781858122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06901795542102923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010369272486247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14322678809861553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14986638135075642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364405716398106,0.0,0.13257341854307286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529829051071137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09050192586433717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11234450075443653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413731895183213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23621803957625,0.0,0.0,0.3234433705844084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.424873339184714,0.0,0.12347722513929675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938542848236185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09591384786919926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331920735594167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028470907769313,0.14346772569807212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097399861390792

addiction,OnlyCheese,2019/02/06,"Reaching out for help Many times I’ve reached out to my parents for help. Like, sat them down and told them to stop enabling me, sat them down and begged them to send me to rehab, etc. I’ve never gotten anywhere. Personal anecdotes and words of encouragement. More than ten years on and they still won’t take me seriously. 



I sat them down tonight and told them if they don’t stop supporting my addictions then I’ll be dead within the year. They just won’t hear it. And I get that it’s all on me, but I can’t stop. I keep reaching out for help, but everyone keeps blowing me off.

addiction,Dcap1325,2019/02/06,"I sense I’m going down the wrong path I’m in my early 20’s, I don’t have a job at the moment and I’ve been smoking weed daily for a few years now.  Never done any other drugs besides cocaine at parties twice.  I don’t drink that often either.  I ran out of weed today, I smoke because I think it helps with my depression as well as suicidal thoughts.  I immediately felt ill this morning and wanted something else to fill the void, my sister had her wisdom teeth removed months ago and there were Tylenol-codeine pills that have never been used by her.  I did a quick google search of the dangers etc and I took two of them.  I didn’t really feel much but it took the edge off and I already have two set aside for the morning knowing I’m going to want to take them again.  I have a very addictive personality and I fear I won’t be able to control myself.  

TLDR: I tried opioids for the first time and liked them and I’m scared because I know how easily addicted I get to things I enjoy.

I only play on weekends and try to met her demands of around 6 hrs a week, but it’s just so hard for me when no one has the timer and times me. I lose track of time and also find myself pushing for another game when I lose, if my mom doesn’t tell me to turn the game off. I also think about gaming, but not all the time, as much as think about sports.

addiction,armanoroomchi,2019/02/07,"Today I lost a friend. I am now 3 years sober. See my other post in /addiction. I recently got a message from a close friend of 20 years. Friends since age 7. He told me he was having trouble with narcotics and needed some advice. I was shocked. I thought his life was perfect. He knew I had fought and won a battle with heroin and that I had almost died due to a heart virus. I told him that I knew 4 people who had died in the past year. He said he knew. He said he had heard the horror stories. He said: fuck, its scary eh. He asked me if he could reach out to me if he was in trouble. I made sure he has every way of contacting me possible. We spoke a lot these past few months. On Friday my friend drank for his brother's birthday. A lot. And did drugs. He went home, got in bed, took off his glasses, and never woke up. His father found him the morning. Tomorrow is his funeral. Today I visitied his casket. I waited and watched his chest, wanting it to move. It did not. He is gone. His family is destroyed. He did not want to die. He does not get a second chance. You have a second chance. Right now. Not tomorrow. Right this second. Do not make your family and friends grieve over your body. Do not make them ask what else they could have done. Get sober. And do it right fucking now. Please.

addiction,sarareheis,2019/02/07,"Can Mindfulness Really Help You Heal From Addiction? by Lena Franklin &gt;According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 24 million Americans struggle with substance abuse. Managing addiction is an extremely complex issue, requiring us to consider how our genetics, environment, personal experiences, mental health, and more all might be playing a role. If you're struggling with an addiction, it's always best to reach out for help and work with a medical professional. Mindfulness can also help us cultivate nonjudgmental awareness, which can be helpful in fighting addiction. For example, if strong cravings arise, a mindfulness tool such as mindful breathing can bring us back into the present moment and help us feel grounded. Practicing the art of letting go of desire strengthens the mindfulness muscle—bolstering the mind and body to ""host"" cravings without needing to react to them. In other words: Mindfulness becomes the portal through which we reclaim our lives by responding rather than reacting to our thoughts and emotions.

I don’t know what to do next. I am worried that I’ll take this year and just throw it away because “I got it, now what?” Of course I want to be clean. If I relapse I will die and it will destroy my kids (I have already put them through enough in active addiction).

Maybe I’m just having a bad day. Maybe it’s these pregnancy hormones. Maybe because my husband should be celebrating his year, too, but he relapsed a few times since then. (He’s currently clean)

I should be happy, but I’m sad today.

Driving around half lit, meeting up with sketchy people in sketchy parts of town. It’s not fun. The stuff I used did not really do much for me and really just caused problems. That was three weeks or so ago and I’m still clean. I am disappointed in myself for using, but I do value the insight that I gained from it.

All of the shitty things that I have done have started to catch up on my conscience and it's really damaged my self esteem, and I'm still dealing with the effects of some of my behaviours. I'm currently in university doing a course I'm really interested in (thankfully) but my use of drugs and alcohol is really affecting my work so i'm really going to need to take a break. However it's really difficult because everyone around me is constantly drinking/smoking/getting on mdma, ketamine, coke etc and I have no faith in my ability to be able to socialise normally while sober. Does anyone have any general pointers that might be able to help me? I just want to prove to myself I can do it",4.511807017543858,6.3421062157894745,6.428947368421053,71.53096491228072,71.05263157894737,10.96140350877193,31.08771929824561,10.93419730881044,4.09139298245614,791,35,139,28,15,275,116,190,0.078,0.826,0.096,0.5148,2,0,7,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,2,6,7,0,0,7,0,16,7,0,4,2,27,30,12,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,1,1,7,12,4,0,2,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,4,0,19,4,27,23,3,21,1,2,0,0,6,9,0,2,8,95,26,1,0.23714796304932464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3801585767982408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063437351185232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08290968486443676,0.0,0.0,0.1055559827008828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07228159857352763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12813634984949215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224456838587006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037648902881928,0.12134235110680165,0.0,0.0,0.4125245214628608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322413330164766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11330252072316001,0.0,0.0,0.11178099696734048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06195001138602744,0.0,0.06738832623894213,0.0994542299984375,0.0948344449646281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15895528076744428,0.0,0.1189393714007445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12021540634369515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125788256306744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792110485507268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11617732625410394,0.0,0.134997263868886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11319228229096236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3798076441251088,0.0,0.0,0.25460816216734383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12369852275469705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392727442008957,0.0,0.0946933348138514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17830575478494146,0.0,0.0,0.10916699127107453,0.0,0.0,0.07877528454662919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20481969827145835,0.0,0.0,0.06993800644917368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08632327075925829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07635775650119055
addiction,pityparty12,2019/02/08,"Addicted to tobacco Don't know if this is really the place to post this, but I have no other outlet to turn to right now so here it goes; I started using chew tobacco a few months ago (snus), and I've been on and off ever since, and I really want to quit. Started due to peer-pressure, and now I want to quit because I feel unhealthy using. Any tips? I am kind of desperate at this point.

addiction,hamburgerhelper69,2019/02/08,"Talking to the addiction I was wondering if there was a short script out there for ""talking"" to an addictive substance. For example, I am trying to hold a ceremony where I actually speak to the addiction as if it were a person. 

Example:

**""Hello cigarette, you have had control over me my whole life, now is the time for me to let you go**...""

&amp;#x200B;

Sort of like [this commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnqZoKZuHCg) but the opposite...more like letting go of the particular substance.

addiction,addicthero,2019/02/08,"What do you think of my idea for the cover of my memoir? I've written a memoir titled *The Addict with a Thousand Faces.* The title was inspired by Joseph Campbell's book *The Hero with a Thousand Faces* which alludes to us all being on a 'hero's journey.' While the details in our stories may be different, the underlying patterns are likely to be very similar.   


As addicts (in recovery or not) I believe we are on the hero's journey, and the struggle with addiction is only a small part of a greater journey toward reconnecting with our own self/inner hero. For me, realizing this has giving my addiction and my life a greater meaning. 

&amp;#x200B;

To recognize that we're all on this journey and to inspire others, I'd like to include a mosaic photo of me, made up of hundreds (or maybe thousands if we include the back) of recovering addicts [(as seen here)](https://www.jacobocain.com) on the cover, and include everyone's names and clean dates in an index in the back of the book.

addiction,justwanabehigh69,2019/02/09,"Is addiction as simple as Is the basic underlying principle off addiction that :


Yes taking drug x makes you top of the world but when you don’t take it, you can’t stop thinking about taking it again ? 


I’m currently suffering with  a drug issues, in my case it’s meth .. (Iv only used it 4 times but I’m really struggling not to use again )

When I take it I just feel amazing , and I keep saying to myself ahh just have a few days break maybe give it a week then have another weekend mini binge , what’s the harm? 

Yes there are obviously health and mental/ money problems associated with drug abuse but it just comes down to as soon as you use again ,your one taking one more step into the darkness off addiction??  The next time will be il just give it a few more days then the few days breaks turn into daily then you don’t enjoy it but your brain is now wired into thinking that taking substance x = happiness ",2.255623081645183,4.548821011049725,3.6521086556169458,86.78883210558627,79.22099447513813,6.674155923879683,21.10527931246164,7.793537801064563,0.9388303253529764,717,20,143,12,18,235,107,181,0.14300000000000002,0.752,0.106,-0.8573,1,0,4,0,1,0,16.0,0,7,0,1,13,7,0,1,10,2,11,9,1,4,1,28,31,15,0,1,9,0,1,0,0,1,8,1,0,0,12,8,0,2,3,1,1,2,4,4,0,2,0,2,12,3,19,29,5,34,0,1,0,0,10,10,0,0,20,93,24,0,0.0,0.13183234366288726,0.0,0.3638899958349771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166723927554273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420996292402275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09584604531090712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21527263120321505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38710066929922105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056259572749442516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21347350288188224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11844502068753268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11827084923858396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161330851379718,0.0,0.0988985792347904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07427110378959488,0.0,0.1117819302930114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11213023695027717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11833294771106813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507938175655784,0.08462301738966681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10646680009996666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07128002608156536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884834092470097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930235896149383,0.0,0.11631967105519465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5019503575622059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14258987493147476,0.0,0.0,0.12976052161386106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12102575828962615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28829501579223354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925109580520857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,PairOfDice-Paradise,2019/02/09,"Married to and Addict need advice/to just have an outlet. My husband relapsed this past Wednesday after being sober from Cocaine for 3 months.
Before that he had been using weekly for a whole year. When we got married he never told me he had an addiction ,we will be married for 3 years this June. Anyways I don’t know how to help him anymore without me being an enabler.
I grew up with a father for an addict and really don’t want to see another life wasted for so long to this disease.
My husband says he uses because he gets stressed out, (life has anxieties and stresses no one can escape them.
I refuse to give up on him but don’t know how much more either of us can take this.
He sees a therapist once a week, but they’re not (to me anyways) helping if they don’t talk about his addiction problems. Or getting to the root of what stems from him wanting/needing to feel like he has to use.
In the year of his downward spiral he put us in thousands of dollars in debt, wrecked his car, needing 12 staples to close up his head from said accident on one of his “binges” as I call them.My car blew motor from me trying to find him because he wasn’t in his right mind.
I’ve offered to go with him to programs, I listen to all his fears/incoherent ramblings.when he first relapsed a year ago and he was fired from his job I said let’s get ahead of this before it becomes a bigger problem. Trying to get him to a treatment program but he refused saying it was a mistake and he was ok and would get ahead of it.
I just don’t know what to do.
I can’t force him to change I can’t force him to see how it’s hurting him and his family.
But he’s trying to shift the blame on me of his relapse because Wednesday morning he was heading to a job interview with the company he is presently employed with for a higher position when I finally snapped and said” all you talk about is work I’m tired of it, same thing day in day out”.
He literally will talk about work problems until the moment he wakes up until we go to bed. Not much in-between 
I know I shouldn’t have snapped but is it really my fault he relapsed ?
With us not having a car my mom has been letting us borrow hers and Wednesday night I had trainings at work so my mom picked my husband up and all he had to do was pick me up 15 minutes straight shot from our home to my job. He never showed up and instead went to get high. 
Part of me refuses to take the blame but part of me feels like if I just didn’t snap he would be fine 

Sorry for rambling but maybe I just needed to write this down without dissolving and throwing in the towel.
Please no advice of just divorce because I’m not going to do that.

addiction,GenderAssumer9001,2019/02/09,"Sober from alcohol and weed but I still feel the intense urge to play video games for 18 hours a day. 40 days clean from marijuana and alcohol but my hardest addiction to overcome by far... is video games. I use to spend literally 12 hour minimum a day on them. 

To get clean from alcohol and weed I literally moved to an island and have just been working out and trying to find a job. I still get the urge to play video games and I’m afraid when I go to the mainland all this work will be for nothing.. 

Any advice robobros?

addiction,xxox96,2019/02/09,"Addicted to escort Hey, I’m a 22 years old guy. The first time I visited an escort was 2 years ago. At first it was simple curiosity. I never had sex and all of my friends would speak about it and I wouldn’t know anything about it, so in the end some kind of conversations started to become impossible with me. It frustrated me. So I thought it was a great idea. 

The first time I got out full of shame and promised myself to never go again. It wasn’t even that amazing after all. 

3 months later I went to see another one. 2 months later another one. Then a month later and stayed around 1 per month for a year.

It has been a year now, I’m seeing around 3/4 escort per months. Always with the same feeling of shame. And it’s always the same thing. There is nothing amazing In it. It just happens that I find some warmth in it. 

I moved to live alone 8 months ago thinking it was great idea, maybe it would make me more responsible. In the end I got kicked off my apartment 2 months ago since I didn’t have any money left since i spent all of it on escort (around 200€ the meeting, I’m getting 1200€ a month in apprenticeship and the flat was 500€) 
Hopefully my family had my back and took me back in their home. But they still don’t understand what and how it happened since I’m lying to them (yeah they don’t know I’m seeing escorts obviously) 

Right now it’s becoming stronger and stronger. Only this week I’ve seen two escort and Im actually -1800€ in my account. I got a letter recently that basically say they will close my account and I’ll need to pay a fine after giving back the money I owe them. 

It isn’t only about money, it’s just not right to see escort. But I can’t stop. Even thought I just feel full of shame and like a shit during/after the meeting, I just have the feeling that it’s the right thing to do. 

I’ve been in therapy for 5 years for different reasons. I told him once that I went to see escort but I didn’t let him understand that it was something frequent for me. 

What should I do? How can I get out of it ?",1.2837120448179284,3.3143416070588256,2.96066386554622,91.85922549019608,81.16470588235293,6.024089635854343,20.942577030812323,7.1686216300943375,0.4608106442577027,1593,46,353,21,42,526,188,425,0.045,0.8759999999999999,0.08,0.8593,3,1,1,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,6,3,24,15,2,3,22,1,30,3,1,4,6,62,70,20,0,6,8,0,3,1,1,5,1,2,1,1,32,20,0,1,14,0,8,6,11,5,0,6,24,11,41,10,44,40,10,75,0,0,6,1,20,24,1,3,45,222,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.06821749079547478,0.07620709759516739,0.0,0.0,0.18590049714761653,0.0,0.0,0.07240081054078316,0.0,0.0,0.11633362252967748,0.0,0.0,0.0475380025180978,0.1466036086148415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057526107232062564,0.1866916187064048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16125858673435473,0.0,0.0,0.1544098277669384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0730361620097484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12383069716638848,0.0,0.0,0.09234358536290764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06590049731741066,0.0,0.10603866333855322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389217959090696,0.1783842425219979,0.0,0.0,0.05400866292117892,0.0,0.0730452701249618,0.06705953552298022,0.039728794097548835,0.0,0.16772896795192085,0.15414168449500282,0.0,0.0692172394805099,0.12363405539378053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012071764057877,0.06943173807065535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15782915412124832,0.07550972197505304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07279561472012476,0.07683625160031977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07595231516818504,0.07148290752885078,0.0,0.034152199506268084,0.0,0.061727662394592514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04666233191165756,0.0,0.07022927177485963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4463819609969053,0.07429827299999878,0.0,0.05183389566956867,0.10783055686228288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0670760226298647,0.0,0.07335385511634235,0.07444686517268245,0.09473928360354772,0.1063322644561478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187429317236889,0.0690230522911016,0.0,0.0,0.17909623786762255,0.0,0.05559150194745634,0.0,0.0,0.2785273751386508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07175678794157116,0.17347916459906873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05381651674721842,0.0,0.0,0.049479332559492856,0.07450975074054311,0.05582646448125838,0.058443962628089936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07994280514977557,0.0,0.09288395288619893,0.04479249487218713,0.0,0.11099400258734048,0.08152468752489543,0.0,0.0,0.06679751179132931,0.07766736267677972,0.0,0.0,0.0682873224208657,0.14554776945941578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056073816645300006,0.0,0.0,0.12960583061908956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09931744172598478,0.0,0.0,0.22508361277813746
addiction,bill_clinternet,2019/02/09,"Found myself IVing meth, against my will, AGAIN. Something has to change Started meth at 16, i smoked it regularly from. About 17 until I was 22, with a few months here and there of clean time in between.  After a friend helped me get clean and stay sober for 4 months during the summer of 2012 I woke up 1 day in August and decided I was going to relapse but, not just any relapse, I was going to IV the drug for the first time(something that I looked down upon and never believed I’d ever do). That stupid decision has had me trapped for almost 10 years now. I am 29 years old now. I have the most  amazing and beautiful wife that is right by my side wanting so bad to help me, even after 3 years of mental and verbal abuse from my constant lies &amp; using. We have a little boy, almost 3 years old who needs his dad.
I tried getting a college degree, getting married, having a kid, changing friends/location, none of which kept me sober:( 
I know that I’m going to use again if something doesn’t change. I struggle so much with God and a higher power but I need him now. My addiction is telling me that I should give up that I’m  hopeless &amp; I’ll always be a user but I’m still holding on. I have the tools I learned from 2 treatment centers I’ve been to and completed successfully, but keep failing. 
I’m pretty sure I am stuck in this continuous cycle because I am so afraid/ashamed of people finding out I’m a meth user, the stigma that comes with that I cannot take. 
I need God, a sponsor and a real psychic change.

My Punctuation/grammar are shit, sorry.
I struggle with expressing myself in words and have so much more to say but Im just going to leave this.

addiction,tikitrona,2019/02/09,"Normal life I’ve had depression for a while and alcohol has made me enjoy/forget it. I had trouble getting out of bed but I finally got to start the insanity program again. I did it 4 days and I felt great! Positive and healthy. I didn’t feel like drinking or anything.

Today is Friday and my voice can benefit from alcohol. Or so I tell myself as an excuse. I get into it again and I’m up late again. I never said I’d stop drinking but that was implied by working out and losing weight.

I had been drinking 4-5 days of the week. This week with exercise just today so far. It might be habit but should I feel as guilty as I feel. I want to change. I never said I wouldn’t drink but I hoped it would happen naturally which it has been in less frequency.

As long as I keep my workout routine I think it shouldn’t throw me off but I still feel guilty drinking even today.

Is it possible for people addicted to drinking heavy to ever live a normal life where you can just drink a couple or few drinks or does that conditioning ruin you forever? So far for me it has. It’s part control but the other part is discipline which can be controlled.

addiction,AFriendOfAll,2019/02/09,"I need help with my pornography addiction. Hey everybody. I have been struggling with a pornography addiction for a while. Really only 5 years, but I'm 16 and it is out of hand. (Don't know whether I should mention that...) It's normal for a kid like me to have something like this, but I feel like if I don't stop this it could seriously mess me up in the future, like it has done to many others. I really truly want to stop. I am going to go to a addiction program soon, so that should help. Any other help you guys can offer? Please? It's tearing me apart. I feel like I am living a double life, which I am sure many other addicts feel. It just does not work.",1.0896428571428558,3.202887838235295,3.1221008403361346,89.98088235294121,82.38235294117645,6.532773109243697,20.00840336134453,7.7094869923839395,0.7200373949579841,510,14,110,9,14,172,84,136,0.048,0.643,0.309,0.9901,0,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,0,1,3,9,0,1,6,0,15,6,1,0,1,23,24,7,0,7,6,0,4,5,0,2,5,0,0,2,14,4,0,2,4,0,0,2,3,3,0,0,2,4,15,6,13,19,1,12,0,0,0,0,9,4,0,1,11,74,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5835308654663367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100166725705876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10684376853347644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171061125387593,0.13694353634417786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20298907497942603,0.19120097350311005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15210510789185794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13250207964164076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2690886331564001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07354355074921373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09452048173126773,0.3268865887226656,0.0,0.11816483436909753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27134339688651604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09922526560857137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311144357689679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10177555677738157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14689333260800946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145605451888407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030205833343514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2237577415349186,0.0,0.13989691754066302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612304336153005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893005072550392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09742199536058076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861751985782525
addiction,vaporwaremedia,2019/02/09,"Not Sure Who I Am I'm 27 and for the past ten years I've not been sober for 90-95% of the time. I've been full blown addicted to Phenibut benzos and opiates and heavily used stimulants as well, and non stop use of weed/extracts. If I quit one drug I cycle the others until I can use it again safely/no withdrawal. I get maybe 2-3 weeks of being afraid and take a tolerance break once every 1-2 years, but then I'm right back. My week is now basically 6 days on Adderall (50-60 mg+ a day) + Caffeine + nicotine, then maybe one day off, with a rotation of alcohol Kratom benzos and Phenibut at night, always smoking hash oil/dabs. I don't have prescriptions, I have to source it myself, not always easy, but I've had a relatively successful ""career"" and I can buy anything anytime and I always keep a stockpile of what I need. I've spent last year likely 6k in coke alone - and that was probably once a month average. I have a business and employees and 15+ people relying on me, and I use that as a justification for the stimulants, but I know there's no excuse. My life is so boring, I'm so unmotivated and bored, and I'm such an empty person, I need a crutch. I can't focus on anything anymore and my personality has became very dry, even with the assistance of drugs. If I'm not dry I'm likely very annoying and overly talkative. My memory is that of an old man. I am trapped by stimulants but I cannot slow down as there is so much on the line, it's a pivotal point in my business that will decide my future. 

I also feel like I've used my body and mind to the point I've actually hurt my iq and am guaranteed declining mental and physical health in the future; my heart has hurt pretty nice after 48 hours and 2 8 balls and similar experiences. I've even been hospitalized multiple times, once a potential stroke. I feel so empty that even sadness at its peak feels like a brief small wave that immediately fades away, I don't know how to explain it. it's difficult for me to feel sadness, or guilt, everything is very blunted. 

I don't know why I'm saying this and I know it's nothing compared to others here but I truly feel trapped and I'm worried I will end up irreparably miserable or continue until I die an empty junky, if I don't have a fucking stroke soon ",4.996280468991053,5.078440481641471,6.456336778771982,78.2257640388769,68.58963282937364,9.983616167849428,30.358608454180807,9.871247098662263,2.7275900030854667,1785,64,366,39,28,612,238,463,0.168,0.769,0.064,-0.9939,1,3,3,0,0,0,55.0,0,0,0,2,18,20,2,3,24,0,30,12,2,10,1,66,60,46,1,5,14,0,7,4,0,2,8,1,0,3,18,25,2,2,12,1,2,1,11,12,1,3,6,8,38,8,40,51,2,53,0,5,0,1,7,19,1,5,36,213,56,2,0.0,0.0,0.08318643148803255,0.09292919497740787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09110055129503092,0.0,0.08828769565544334,0.0,0.06817007464963101,0.21279100434814602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08453973583882234,0.0,0.0,0.14029808256596346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009010640330211,0.06554783443761714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946875319521683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649271418342765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08847043489187342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1977133418611816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755014123638098,0.0,0.0,0.16890976011229308,0.0,0.07182225083429977,0.0,0.07661234855893362,0.08338557452228232,0.0,0.0,0.21551115166200768,0.1217975164507608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07880725773154122,0.0445367843929701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09061102202452642,0.0,0.1010152596995538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394875833925987,0.0,0.1825122116027823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07576931592974886,0.0,0.0,0.18739280806180664,0.06948572525023315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06021078092685893,0.1665848198909273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712793137604328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859065055787417,0.0,0.08607274401591959,0.0,0.0680414252689464,0.0,0.06266458829172286,0.1264155793651804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07999628109670602,0.0,0.0817944913529288,0.0,0.08944986647652335,0.2723481460680004,0.11552789222840484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08137561492810033,0.05909787132755651,0.14886459080492564,0.0,0.0,0.1611673982077816,0.0,0.0,0.08672440269546307,0.09190809501168397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09066812350596944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07279842137948025,0.0,0.06778992622190774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07126830137489085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034202528992931,0.0,0.06409332927639971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994136218481792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3681198169806376,0.0,0.21100716398140465,0.0,0.0,0.13675615013814532,0.0,0.07664513154681098,0.0,0.0769199912278279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657002768258006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16468417980588726

addiction,sober_dad,2019/02/10,"Abusing prescription meds X post from r/stopdrinking

Hi... 

I feel like I've been posting a lot so sorry if that's annoying.

I've been battling with alcoholism for a while. I had a few months off then started a one step forward, two step back thing. 

I'm 35 and have also had a long history of drug use. Weed since 14 to 28 (successfully quit), ecstasy and cocaine in my 20s (rarely now and hopefully never).

Most recently I was diagnosed with adult ADHD and prescribed dexamphetimine. Well, I've been popping them like candy and using them in a way they were not meant to be used. 

The pills are like speed and I get all perked up and then crash. I also drink. 

I promised myself I'd try to manage them and only take X amount or whatever. It's not working. I can't trust myself around them and it's a fucking slippery slope. 

I'm planning on taking the pills and the prescription and throwing them in a bin at a gas station. 

The script is tightly controlled so I can't get more for at least 6 months. 

I think I can manage without the pills anyway. I don't think my ADHD is severe. I managed my whole life without. 

I think part of me wanted to get the prescription because I like popping pills and was hoping this would help or maybe even because I wanted to abuse them. 

Alcohol is scary by me on uppers is worse. I become completely different and it scares me. I can see myself wanting to act out and go crazy on the booze. 

I think throwing it all away now is the best way forward. Then I can go back to being sober. 

What do you think guys? Just need some encouragement.

Good riddance, drugs that lied to me and convinced me that life sucked without using. What a lie! Life is great man and I’m so happy I’m free. Total freedom! I feel like I was just born a brand new person man it’s the best. 

God bless you, all my fellow users, wherever you’re at in your journey.

addiction,Joeldub_M2,2019/02/10,"The Isolation.. No need to go into detail, because in the end, a lot of these types of stories are achingly similar. I feel like I'm completely alone in trying to support my loved one's recovery and relapse cycles. I can't express any of the negative emotions I'm having because it's not helpful. I can't reach out to friends/family without exposing the secret. I can't afford a therapist. I don't subscribe to either the higher power or detachment strategies of most of the support groups where I live. Meetings don't give me any hope because I don't get to hear the success stories; just more anger, sadness and overbearing loneliness to add to my own.

addiction,HorrorMaster101,2019/02/10,"Fast Food Addiction, what can I do? Where can I go? I’ve been addicted to fast food for a long time and I’m always worried about my health and weight. 

I’m about 30 pounds from the weight I want to be. I weigh about 170-180 and my goal weight is 140 -150. 

I believe it stated in middle school. I would go to school, during that time period I was having a tough time with self image and other personal problems. I would never eat breakfast and nothing at lunch. I never got school lunch because I was uncomfortable with getting food. 

So after school my dad would take me to Wendy’s and I would get a chicken sandwich and fries. I did this before I went to my tutor. School ended around 2:30 and my tutor was from 3 to 4. So I would always eat fast so I could be on time. It just became a habit and I did that for two - three months. 

Then I went to a boarding school with set meal times so I was removed from that cycle. 

Then during high school I was okay. Only eating if I went out with my parents or to the mall with my friends. 

It started back up again when I got my first job. My family shares two cars so I would often get driven to work. 

In the same parking lot of my place of work was an Arby’s so when ever I had a lunch break I was there. I worked for four months. I would always get the same chicken sandwich to the point where I was a regular. I felt horrible because the staff knew my name and order. 

I would always tell myself I would bring a lunch from home, but I never did because i didn’t have any food to bring or I never had enough at home to make a meal.

While I was working there even on my off days I found myself using Uber Eats. When ever I ordered I would always get way too much food for myself to eat. Throwing away a burger that I couldn’t finish. I always told myself not to order so much. Because I wouldn’t need it. Yet I couldn’t stop myself from getting the same thing and wasting food. I always felt guilty after eating which I knew was a bad sign. 

After that I was at college so I had meal plans and would binge eat. Instead of going to the cafe three times a day (breakfast lunch dinner) I would go once and get a days worth of food and then eat it all at once. ( my classes didn’t start until 12 and finished them around 3, so I would wake up at 11 go to class, then the cafe and hang out all day with friends) 

Then during the summer I worked in a mall. I would get food court stuff every lunch. Which then I relapsed. 

I would get subway ( I thought it I was gonna eat fast food, I would at least eat something kinda healthy) 

It was a way for my brain to make excuses for my to eat. 

Whenever I go get fast food I would order way too much. Like two servings. 

At the job I work at now, i have a Panera bread. And I get soup and a salad. So I’m working on it. But I found myself in a cycle getting uber eats, and I keep making reasons to do it, yet I know and want to stop. 

Anyone else with an eating addiction/food problem can help me understand and how to help myself? I know working out can help. Or when I feel hungry to drink 1-2 glasses of water. Or getting better food in the house so I can make meals. 

Though when I do go food shopping I get junk and really unhealthy snacks that doesn’t make a meal.

addiction,sophsophmostprob,2019/02/10,"500 days clean and sober, still can’t believe it! It has been the hardest but most rewarding time in my life so far, after a heavy few years of battling with cocaine addiction and alcoholism, I’m happy today to say I’m recovering one day at a time.  500 days ago, I rocked up to a rehab centre, jobless, having everyone finally giving up on me, it was my last chance, I’d lost the will to live. It couldn’t be more different today! Everything I lost in my drinking and using I have gained 100 times over. Putting my head on the pillow clean and sober hasn’t got old yet, and I hope it never does! To anyone struggling out there, it does get better with a little bit of honesty and work on yourself!

I'm 20 now and I just have this constant thought of ""im bored if I'm sober."" I used to smoke weed everyday from about 18 until I used heroin, but I only used for about a month and that was recently. Between that I've used kratom when I ran out of anything since I just have to go to the smoke shop. I've also been addicted to coke and Adderall. I also would use Molly and acid A LOT over this past summer. Even going to work I needed something to get me through.

addiction,TheIllestBlanco,2019/02/10,"The Sinclair method. Has anyone ever tried this method for alcohol addiction?

The principle behind it is you take this pill one hour before you drink any alcohol and it blocks the happy hormones in your brain. Then over time you don’t want alcohol as much due to less fun and less craving.

I watched a documentary on Amazon Prime called One little Pill. Is about this Sinclair Method. Then did some reading online. Seems legit to me.

Just wondering everyones opinion or experiences with it.",4.358620689655177,7.561818942528737,4.350126436781611,79.37001724137933,77.9655172413793,7.617931034482758,27.090804597701148,8.548686976883017,2.5987204597701155,396,16,63,9,10,122,67,87,0.021,0.872,0.107,0.7787,0,0,7,0,0,0,9.0,0,4,0,0,3,2,0,0,4,0,5,8,1,0,1,12,9,6,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,3,4,1,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,6,2,10,8,4,10,0,0,1,0,5,4,0,5,6,44,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20145232848007666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5924645593453485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12566600225921534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12921199969332778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15724576470168708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20629080110366055,0.1886949529152388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810274014311845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671564140002755,0.0,0.17657822842858145,0.0,0.1807636249646472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19671625068688506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18198449738606445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852117598900127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358445774514881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2504418864218669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18484363339095686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16822917639345852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1389418086093394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077546491650032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546274161800394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108996068223374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20040080420730108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,jjtaylor1998,2019/02/10,"Cravings have been so bad recently i'm almost 2 years off benzos, which is great and im really proud of myself. my dad is prescribed them and i know where he hides them- every break home from college i've been doing so good not even looking or checking and i'm so proud of myself

i had a way to buy them now at school, and i probably won't but the cravings are so bad from knowing that i can do that. i literally can get any drug i want and all i can think about is stupid xanax (not saying i will do those drugs). i smoke weed and it used to help kind of but it's weird now because i'm just like high, not fucked up, if that makes sense. i can't escape my problems, they're still there, i'm just high. idk how to deal with this but it's been bad recently. i miss the feeling of just taking as many as you can and just forgetting fucking everything 

even though i still have cravings, im almost two years clean which is amazing. it would be three years clean but spring break two years ago my friend, knowing i was addicted to benzos before, offered it to me and i couldn't say no. we're not friends anymore. but everything will be okay. just need to work on keeping distracted, doing my work, and using good coping skills",1.3777014652014683,3.56930525,2.471746031746033,94.60445054945058,81.8174603174603,5.464224664224664,20.406593406593405,6.67199483983844,0.17805384615384678,961,27,210,10,26,305,144,252,0.124,0.6890000000000001,0.187,0.9489,0,0,3,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,3,5,20,21,3,1,3,1,28,6,0,4,1,45,49,24,0,6,16,1,1,1,2,4,4,2,3,0,12,10,0,1,5,0,2,0,8,10,0,3,5,4,25,11,20,37,1,22,0,1,1,2,13,7,2,4,13,132,37,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11693395443304225,0.0,0.0,0.0950833581495599,0.0,0.21481946792252368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07294342385034755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10637739432437324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26868370976702044,0.06538734105194616,0.0,0.09127404594002718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058481608792592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2487851413500408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14169415899254434,0.0,0.0903748257840639,0.0,0.19280452989131408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054236069072554016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16574431328074,0.19832829256324427,0.05604118617478484,0.0,0.0,0.1799364647241823,0.0,0.11825930444642757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718970205464943,0.2266613114587781,0.107594870558561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23172776991424135,0.0,0.0,0.09534146657039268,0.0,0.11169929525236463,0.17684901459901534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052403934369327936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09007502346968337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07159977437381466,0.10874919660634537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07953514286176899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11564909172770442,0.10263747913394546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06871627758836009,0.0,0.21182117430355973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17060180378790513,0.0,0.10855723031477328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171322867811811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08064942827590986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06873065265063655,0.10538666134760373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2095633320333235,0.0,0.0,0.18528388593134215,0.0,0.0,0.06326728199755348,0.08514143381077732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15617942207278004,0.0,0.0,0.0761975037212879,0.0,0.0,0.2762988514276372

addiction,nomoreramen78,2019/02/11,"Need someone just to listen to me. Isnt it just crazy how a drug can bring you to almost death, and you still want to do it? I have been clean now for 5 months from meth. And i feel great. I used for about 2 years. Towards the end, it was a daily habit. It ended with me being in heart failure.  I know it was caused by my meth use. Why? Because now my heart has miraculously made a significant recovery. And they have search for a cause of the heart failure and jave not found one yet. The cardiologist was amazed that my heart has returned to normal size and my heart squeeze has returned to just about  that of a healthy heart again. She's amazed at my quick recovery. 

That's because my heart is not pumping like a frieght train 24/7 anymore. Five months ago, i thought i was going to die, and i knew it was all because of my drug of choice. And once i took that drug of choice away, my heart got better. And i have a new lease on life again. I am so happy.

And yet, here i sit. Craving. The thing that just about killed me. That i swore i would never do again. I can almost feel the burn in my nose, i want it so bad. How can i be so stupid.

addiction,42Five9,2019/02/11,"Codeine Addict  Even writing that title hits me hard in the gut. Ive tried to deny it many times but I'm only kidding myself. I hate the fact that I have become so vulnerable to this and how it's became a permanent fixture in my life.

I spend almost £300/$390 a month on over the counter painkillers. It's such an embarrassing amount to spend and I'm tired of it. I WANT to stop and I NEED to stop.

I hate that warm feeling I get when it's time for my next dose because I know I'm going to be popping more pills and I don't want to. My mind is literally screaming at me to stop this but I can't. 

Cold turkey unfortunately is impossible due to the nature of my job so the only other method I can think of is a taper. Has anyone had a codeine problem like mine? Do you have any suggestions for me that might help me through this?

addiction,nevillxxx,2019/02/11,"10 months coke free as of the 13th Okay I know it's 2 days away but I wanted to share my story and I couldn't wait if I'm completely honest. I'm telling this because there's not many people who I can discuss this with in my personal life who'll care very much. 
When I was 17 (I'm currently 19) I worked in a shop at the time and was pretty open with my drug use (as of this point I'd only experimented with acid, weed and nos) but I guess word got around my work but no one really seemed to care because they all used drugs as well. A few months into working that job I was offered a line in the back room by my assistant manager, I'll call her Jo, I took the line and didn't think much of it other than it was a good way to bond with the rest of my team who were all quite a bit older than me. I ended up involving myself with 3 members of the team, one of which was jo, and we became quite close as we all used coke. Over the coming months I used coke more and more frequently, it started out as just using on a night out or at a drinking ""sesh"" at one of the 3s houses. It eventually got to the point that I would be using everyday, at work (which was now a different place as I got fired from the shop) I'd use to make me feel more awake after having gotten no sleep the night before because I was using coke the night before. I was a terrible person while I was using, my temper was short my depression got worse and I used women for sex like a piece of shit. It was weird because I realised it was a problem before I stopped, I had a discussion with Jo the next morning after a night out and I literally said ""I'm addicted man I'm doing it everyday at work"" and she didn't see anything wrong and that was my first red flag, I stopped using as of May 13th and I'm so much happier for it, I'm glad I stopped when I did before anything got worse and I have since distanced myself from 2 of the 3 friends who are still using but I ended up dating one of the three and she quit when I did so we are in this together and I love her more than anything. 
I know this is badly written and doesn't make a lot of sense but I just wanted to brag if I'm being honest because no one but my girlfriend seems to care that I quit. I'll never go back and I try not to look back either. And to anyone struggling with the same or similar situation, you've made it as far as this subreddit so I hope you get the help and support you want, you're gunna need it. :) ",1.7443589176761876,3.075361617870726,3.605412503315944,91.00108276593865,77.30798479087451,6.642072685471749,21.54814749314705,7.3071595529392575,0.5079072950747192,1905,49,437,23,43,643,236,526,0.107,0.7440000000000001,0.149,0.9781,3,0,3,1,0,0,37.0,3,2,1,12,16,25,2,1,31,1,33,13,2,15,4,93,89,44,0,10,15,0,2,1,2,3,4,1,1,4,28,36,5,4,6,5,3,3,10,9,1,7,29,7,57,17,66,54,17,66,0,1,3,2,32,27,1,10,36,287,85,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06137322989519036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03936493473283509,0.0,0.13898559775432134,0.050117237527492434,0.0,0.0,0.052893910399364856,0.12986927239764942,0.047006555020955035,0.1715939708903892,0.0,0.1916221180443906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061462935090281584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748664615943815,0.0,0.1721989697669036,0.0,0.0,0.04849582105092092,0.05902747806196688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036307611740359666,0.0,0.048489463911891566,0.0,0.0,0.05881952341891721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05515069698717226,0.13057582588919067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09972679822615893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507033646791752,0.0,0.0,0.028466006746631505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047887128064898365,0.0,0.0,0.043495766016465584,0.0,0.029413429310420614,0.0,0.03199550291969352,0.04722016829751773,0.22513363442167195,0.0,0.06201869514261232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03773542417318913,0.0,0.0,0.05591670798525721,0.0,0.06496043912892298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05586716910309279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0618799177840642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039765007120651716,0.02750440389239435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047276218015743686,0.0,0.0,0.047862624349288216,0.050811225809786,0.05327061562500653,0.07515882678207242,0.05707742867842775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13480979910918228,0.0,0.12415672548708775,0.04174432166661448,0.04342055900876452,0.0,0.05987365924184763,0.21132778140182945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19074521980859735,0.042817235649171184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03903000821414923,0.09831464435848476,0.05881952341891721,0.0,0.10643978767082372,0.0,0.0,0.057275398817838635,0.0,0.053869670561405916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2395198016920384,0.0,0.0,0.03606599915670378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053552377367679885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044862290169603185,0.10250333660348199,0.0,0.0,0.05778918213462761,0.04657036324675785,0.0632814139011112,0.05633874953767697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03984807909056103,0.0,0.04495972877808724,0.1412031766416651,0.0,0.058854989101493636,0.0,0.0,0.0638864073316378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04920701361009227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036073543962710966,0.0,0.0,0.03282787002451235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06254925138649299,0.03822270878027676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5834817054946992,0.0,0.04645182168966102,0.09961821940529064,0.044686804754106704,0.0,0.0,0.05061874559349322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20492840642918891,0.0,0.11474513030501955,0.0399925490932066,0.0615531254832954,0.0,0.0
addiction,iNick20,2019/02/11,"Fortnite is ruining my life. Please don't fall into the trap I did. I spent roughly $2K on Fortnite since Feb of last year. Money I don't fucking have, but I end up getting somehow to spend on vBuxs (In-Game Points for Skins). It's really is killing me to the point that I'll hop on the game, go check the item shop to see what new skins or items came back to the shop. EpicGames knows exactly what it's doing. Part of me would give up almost everything I own to get the Season 1 skins, if they were to bring them back.

The way the item shop works in game that every 1 or 2 days, they update the shop with skins/pickaxes or emotes and gliders.

A New Skin/Glider/Pickaxe/Emote will probably be there 3 days. After that it's taken off and YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S COMING BACK. So, I basically don't even think twice about it. I gotta have it, if I like it. Because like I said earlier the Season 1 Skins, have not been back in the item shop. So some skins will not be back and or will take a full year before returning. So it's like that one chance you get to buy it now or forever hold your peace.

The skin can usually be 1,200 points, 1,500 points or 2,000 points. Which equals out to $12, $15 or $20.

Emotes, 200 points, 500 points or 800 points. $2, $5, $8

Gliders, 500 points, 800 points or 1,200 points. $5, $8, $12

Pickaxes usually 800 points or 1,200 points.  $8 or $12

vBuxs are usually $10 for 1,000 points or $25 for 2,800 points, $40 for 5,000 points. $99 for 13,500 points.

The part that does it for me is that you don't know when the item will be back in the shop. So it's like forcing me to open my wallet right now. If I knew for sure that Beef Boss, Which is in the item shop, will be coming back in 1 month on this day. I'd feel better and wouldn't spend if I didn't have the $$$. But since I don't know, I spend $$$ not needed at the time on a in game item.",2.1028705238726784,2.560622862980772,3.4213096816976147,96.08317307692309,75.17788461538461,7.084084880636606,20.594827586206893,7.0983637204850245,0.04542632625994658,1445,26,374,14,29,473,177,416,0.026,0.899,0.076,0.9586,0,0,0,0,0,0,86.0,0,4,3,2,19,9,2,0,21,0,33,8,6,1,2,49,57,28,1,7,21,0,8,4,0,8,1,1,0,0,23,11,0,1,7,10,14,6,11,3,0,2,9,10,26,6,38,35,13,74,0,1,1,1,12,37,1,19,34,199,49,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052545198378832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824452302062023,0.0,0.031987704282723586,0.0,0.04465156623967688,0.0,0.0,0.046409048126745615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060016353558786074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040352494177432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10152429670484568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045920409771949784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1770787881532304,0.04647644835900066,0.0,0.0,0.034658626452190214,0.0,0.044211664754599415,0.0,0.04716030799932132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02653246501600316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04851142951638438,0.08224660288241159,0.05033790669085125,0.029822221621817437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05805478061211863,0.0,0.1153534999420401,0.04277336834069804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037063985464510514,0.102544714551131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04188429976047429,0.0,0.0,0.03890885588886808,0.0,0.10135956206357348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03555778593455385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136486023072762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05760076805465249,0.8432842276228135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05657591954706465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033616231086071764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044812566625335865,0.049914854291949605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04181503767133172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0868141811828509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049456187275706574,0.0,0.03945396801211183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033623263414252536,0.0,0.0,0.030598050535428262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17337831442770632,0.0,0.0,0.04165147203007681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03820174584207281,0.0,0.0,0.0372760717427237,0.0,0.0,0.06758315761839948

addiction,MurosMaroz,2019/02/12,"Addicted to World of Warcraft. Sorry for this post but I am desperate and don't even know where to look anymore. Any advice or redirection to a different reddit or a place I can find help at will be deeply appreciated. 

I am genuinely addicted to this game. I have dropped out of two universities and currently struggling at the third one (which I chose close to home and because the subjects are few and easy), abandoned my music hobby too. I ran out of money to get professional help and I don't know where to ask anymore. My relatively decent situation at home and simultaneous little contact and connection with family members keeps me in a situation where I am not forced to work more than weekends playing wedding receptions or teaching the occasional kid some basic English or guitar.

I am at the point where partaking in any activity(physical exercise, studying, practicing music on any of the three instruments I know the basics of) leads me to thoughts that they do not grant me happiness and are too hard to achieve or have too many possibilities and outcomes to be worth even starting. The worst part is that I feel like there is no point giving up on the game because if I get a 9-5 job I will end up wanting to commit suicide anyway, so while I can I am pumping as many ""endorphins"" as possible from Wow. (worked at a bank's back office for 4 months).

A big realisation was that despite all the effort I put in, I could not even ever become a streamer or join one of the top World guilds (highest I have been was 3 months in a rank 40 world guild) so there are literally no benefits and improvents coming from playing and no future prospects, which led me to enabling my addiction before because I thought someday I could just start streaming too and maybe earn.

I am also happily engaged and in a relationship of 7 years but I feel like my fiancee is too supportive and also believes that once we grow older (I am 22) I will get a job anyway. Maybe that's true but will I be happy? I know she makes me happy but WoW stimulates me so much that even if I quit it (and I play for years now, Wc3 as kid and now WoW, I guess parents were not paying enough attention to me) then nothing else will bring me joy. I do not enjoy travelling, sightseeing, going to concerts, I do not and also cannot drink alcohol due to Crohn's disease, neither board games. My best effort of stopping playing the game is when I just replace it with watching TV shows.

Please help. I am currently trying to only log in for raid nights as not to fuck up my guildmates but doing nothing in between just convinces me further that I might as well be playing. I listen to records of amazing musicians and just get depressed and resign more. What also sucks is that even if I take the game in moderation, it feels like reality is working against me and putting up all events at i.e raid night hours or when I am pushing keystones, I get a call from a friend to meet or a proposition of band practice at the same time I planned raiding while other evenings nobody wants to do anything. And if I go and the meeting completely sucks it yet again, draws me back to the game.

I don't know if there is more to add but ama, I have embarrassed myself completely already anyway.

I got pregnant and sobered up. My boyfriend has quit drinking and other substances, although once or twice a week has been smoking and can’t seem to drop it. I totally understand the withdrawal is hell and mentally and physically painful but if you can go 3-4 days without it I feel like it’s just stupid to give it and do it. Then clean for 3-4 days. How can I help someone who has the mindset they’ve already done soooo well due to dropping 10 years of alcohol addiction. I’m so proud and shit but I’m starting to feel like when he says he’s stopping meth he’s lying. It could be so much worse I know. And it has been so much worse and I’m proud of him but I want this to stop.. how can I help?",1.5986931818181844,3.3918433011363684,2.779545454545456,94.7268181818182,79.05681818181819,6.445454545454545,25.20454545454545,7.413659706084162,0.9719272727272732,655,25,152,9,16,210,105,176,0.187,0.679,0.134,-0.8913,0,0,6,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,3,9,9,3,0,5,0,17,8,1,2,1,31,31,24,0,4,7,0,2,2,0,0,5,1,1,0,10,11,4,2,5,1,0,1,2,4,1,1,5,3,12,5,16,24,3,19,1,0,0,0,10,2,2,3,16,90,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30889206568089755,0.0,0.1384426063341997,0.0,0.3028137441740658,0.0,0.0,0.156341248576435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311549849573857,0.0,0.0,0.1827365646157496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14498212288803236,0.0,0.1387869983802492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14326969006958598,0.2024244719887276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13590701591427926,0.08051683939594836,0.0,0.11330997816070305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18992275853995305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786055769398909,0.11548356365885802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13842993350931998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14277449605635906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082940041305541,0.1050497893957093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508786365859145,0.0,0.0,0.15075157470553927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15068818775401194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11266518744798887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12897507364654442,0.0,0.0,0.14542675914286246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200402787328143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002778856898957,0.0,0.0,0.2368923225323397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474880706072744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356324525666564,0.0,0.11364267634355488,0.0,0.1273823205594014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13656908796711725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28875668094436463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737010500175529

addiction,Itzmecorey,2019/02/12,"10 years on and off addict - Always trying but always crawl back somehow. So I’m just sitting here because I am thinking about how much harder it’s becoming for me to want to be clean.  I always have fought to stay away from it or at least be above the influence.   Meth and Heroin have made a big wave in our area in the last 10 years.   

Without major details I basically have always kept good friends and friends I like but are essentially drug friends around.   I’m learning that I can’t associate one bit with people who are still using because I’m just too weak.   I make it a week and all someone has to do is mention a drug and I’ll make my way to find it.   I’ll use a little and then feel bad and go back to my life as normal.   But it’s been going on for so long.  

How do I really break this cycle.  It’s starting to affect my health now.  My sex drive.  My energy levels.  My skin in some ways.   I’m still a healthy 32 year old dude.  Always stayed in shape and ate decent but I just have a serious weakness in willpower.  

Do you guys recommend AA?   I really want to try giving it a shot.   I just don’t have as many friends in the good category as I do in the bad category.   And the good ones just don’t understand that it’s a serious issue.  They think... just stop... and it’s been a pattern of life for a decade for me so it’s not that simple.  I almost need to create a new pattern and never look back.  

I really desperately want to not think about using sometimes anymore.  It’s hurting my relationship and my brain.  I’ve gotten some anxiety I never had before.   

I’m really just rambling because I feel super desperate to hear anyone’s advice in a similar situation and how they put intermittent narcotic use behind them forever.   

I’m not a bad dude, fairly educated, halfway decent training for the job I do.   Treat other people really well.   Just can’t keep doing this anymore.  Someone who can help would be so much appreciated.

addiction,MansonsRib,2019/02/13,"Great friend, old roommate is struggling I just need to vent and want to get some advice. 

My ex roommate and honestly one of my best friends is a recovering addict. Crack, heroin, etc. 

When we lived together he was on probation so he was clean since he had to get drug tested. Once he was done a week later he overdosed and survived but was a complete mess. 

After that he was doing very well. Then I suspected that he was using again and I confronted him and felt he was lying then I moved out. He was taking benzos but nothing else and stopped. 

Once I moved out his gf moved in and he’s been doing amazing. His businesses were doing well and everything and he’s been keeping busy. Then I got a phone call today. 

Things seemed a bit off but I thought nothing of it. Then he told me he’s been fucking up a bit lately. Nothing hardcore but still not being clean. We had s long talk and I reassured him how amazing he’s gotten his life together and how proud everyone was. He went to a meeting and he said that helped. But I’m just scared. 

I’ve seen addiction take so many damn lives. His is one I never ever want to see. He lost his sister to suicide when he was in and out of jail and rehab and he has a lot of demons. But he’s a great guy and has the drive and heart to change things for good. I’ll just never understand addiction and I was hoping you guys could guide me in how I can help him. 

Also, I suffer from severe depression and anxiety so he says that’s another reason why he relates to me well but I don’t think it’s near the level that addiction is so I feel kinda useless.

addiction,AmanDog2020,2019/02/13,"How do you handle a boss thats an addict? We work in F&amp;B.  The place is legitimate and tries to treat us like career professionals but the truth is we are all stuck in Peter Pan mode trying to avoid real adult choices.

I've been there for over half a decade.  It pays my bills and gives insurance to my family.

But one of my managers is without a question an addict.  Cocaine and booze is the favored flavors but it doesn't really stop there.  He's often late or sometimes MIA, cranky AF, walks around making conversation with people by talking shit about someone else, regularly fucks subordinates, also fucks all over our small town, recently got in an almost bar fight at the neighboring bar down the street and quite frankly is lazy when it comes to managing.

But!  He's young (late twenties), handsome, well spoken and has this way of making you like him.  He just generally plays ""cool guy"" real well.

TBH, I've spent enough time around addicts to know he's on an out of control train even if he's still making all the curves in the track and not falling off the rails. I'm also older, have worked along side him for over five years and am actively trying to find new work.  

But, I'm also in the running for a fellow management position there too.  

Anyway, many of us have seen the antics and are kind of over it, but he's still pulling it off and duping apparently enough people in power there into thinking he's worth keeping around,and I don't think those people have drug problems. Our GM definitely knows what he gets up to but continues to have a soft spot for him.

It's really annoying. Thoughts on working with/under a (currently) high functioning addict?",7.05795597484277,7.060803663522017,6.9220125786163536,76.90144654088051,64.25157232704402,9.833962264150944,31.188679245283016,9.444778638647367,2.6520113207547182,1327,43,245,22,18,421,193,318,0.105,0.774,0.121,0.2043,3,1,2,0,1,0,40.0,6,2,0,7,21,18,5,1,20,1,17,11,1,6,4,56,37,23,0,2,12,0,1,2,2,0,5,0,1,2,10,18,3,4,7,3,4,5,4,7,2,3,6,4,15,11,43,31,5,47,0,0,1,2,28,27,3,5,16,150,25,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4033809080887021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09263142650253324,0.0,0.0,0.2219311161308992,0.0,0.1002302447761904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24704993715413096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07968575373756202,0.0,0.0,0.1037533785093712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10727762599337656,0.0,0.07727691788866085,0.0,0.0,0.1911669146680937,0.0,0.06109936032096444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08720645218838491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454883546431262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17104066808852608,0.04833058259074175,0.08874021314578226,0.0,0.0,0.07398552271846523,0.0,0.0,0.09159551340402912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977376995502752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08222360979354304,0.0,0.09633079495649673,0.1016777896112739,0.0,0.20870166207111587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038754712355404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852454798900628,0.09378659494942368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08934290014407181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06268447995271705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923961006657908,0.0,0.09664911236782933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08851577742693505,0.0,0.0,0.10362792451660446,0.09839154961857803,0.0,0.2105842284061418,0.11852346304571505,0.0,0.09133854454130318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495611037165044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07838005896287101,0.0,0.09149082896985662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14775086998759895,0.07733918316394486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07435284278836944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854825749358533,0.0,0.07343945473741607,0.05394100996362676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18841656619337796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22254672806781653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07342698075397659,0.0,0.0,0.1663480608620733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08917251176327061,0.0,0.2693819661104556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059570850343005674

addiction,cgsmith9856,2019/02/13,"One day at a time Sorry for the length, but this is the short version of my story.

I'm in a couple subreddits for support on a few different things I deal with, and I'm here today to introduce myself as a newly sober addict. 

For 6 years I've been an alcoholic and addicted to cocaine and any pharmaceuticals I can get my hands on (pills, cough syrup, etc.) I've lost everything, and multiple times over. I've burned bridges with the people who truly cared and traded if for a circle of addicts who couldn't care less if I OD'd. I thought when I had my daughter, it would make me sober up, but it only made me better at concealing my addiction. 

I recently put myself into a detox program, just got out, and will be in rehab by this time next week (waiting for an open bed at the facility my insurance is accepted at). I've started going to meetings, and not only has it helped and taught me valuable lessons, but it's showed me how much worse it can, and WILL, get. Today I'm only 5 days sober, but that's still something for me to be proud of.

2 days ago was the 1 year anniversary of losing my brother to an overdose, and in the days leading up to it something clicked in me and I knew what I needed to do. It's going to be a long road, but I'm staying hopeful and I'm working on repairing the damage done by my addiction. 

Glad to have found this subreddit, and to all my fellow addicts, you can do it, I can do it, we can do it.

addiction,I_Am_Tyler_Durden,2019/02/13,"How do you cope with the fact that your friends and family are made to feel uncomfortable with your sobriety because it makes them acknowledge their own addiction? Especially when you do not have any friends or family who are not addicts? Cutting off toxic relationship is one thing. But bI didn't realize that every person in my life was an addict until I started trying to get sober. Who here has been in the same boat and what did you do to combat it? 

I just feel now like every relationship I have now, in some way, has this thing floating over it that is unspoken but often felt. I can't be the only person to have dealt with this. 

I just wish that I knew one person who wasn't a current or forget addict that I could converse with one in a while.

addiction,Teh-Voice-of-Reason,2019/02/13,"3 Addiction Lessons 1. Giving in is never an isolated event – When you're in the heat of the moment, and you're thinking about giving in, you may make the decision to give in just this once.  But whatever cravings and urges you're dealing with will come back and at some point you'll be in the same situation only you haven't established the ways and means of tolerating the stress
2. You need to practice and learn how to tolerate the stress – Think of dealing with the stress as a learning experience.  You need to learn how to tolerate it which takes practice.  The only way to quit is to learn how to tolerate it so think of it as practice.
3. When you don't give in you make progress and when you do give in you lose progress – When you don't give in you establish the ways and means of tolerating the stress, but the cravings and urges also start to subside.  Then when you do give in the cravings and urges increase in strength and you have to deal with increased cravings and urges.",7.402499999999996,6.66758341666667,6.8323750000000025,80.27512500000002,63.79166666666666,10.388333333333334,35.34583333333333,9.642632912329526,3.048573333333332,784,31,158,13,10,243,82,192,0.048,0.858,0.094,0.8454,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,13,0,6,13,6,0,4,15,0,12,1,0,5,1,40,31,26,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5,15,0,0,11,0,0,3,4,5,0,0,0,0,13,1,32,27,4,29,0,1,0,0,23,12,0,2,11,105,18,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10513703534705504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712538077825877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07415866443119483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307704940284881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2982852955137513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09433969699312496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6476179628127753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078949758207846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12875281684741818,0.0,0.0,0.21010926022972493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14302242948910288,0.07438273747510751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10270857888746188,0.0,0.14669839686123085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09116974728062513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10257893343653453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084059004470635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06826280622693573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4419002276632388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07251308512122051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853902168670924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22965573975833645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i am 9 months clean and sober. The longest I’ve ever stayed clean. Today, I am no longer homeless, I have family and friends, I earned a human services diploma and now
working on a psychology degree, I love myself,  I’ve forgiven myself, I’m grateful, I’m sober, I’m alive. Today, I woke up and didn’t need drugs or booze. Today I am forever grateful that I have found recovery and have freed myself from the grip of addiction,  #onedayatatime #recoveryispossible",8.04449101796407,8.79881036526946,8.728988023952095,62.22461976047906,62.113772455089816,11.949461077844312,36.46047904191617,11.602472056035307,4.797060359281437,749,33,114,22,10,252,106,167,0.14,0.6509999999999999,0.21,0.9022,0,0,3,0,0,1,26.0,0,0,0,4,3,9,2,0,8,0,11,11,3,0,1,15,21,13,3,2,1,0,3,0,1,0,4,0,3,1,2,10,2,0,1,1,0,0,3,5,0,2,5,5,17,4,16,13,1,18,0,3,1,2,4,5,0,1,12,72,19,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30887070727185345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633680407339863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11310767710000033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14702551660080904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13877740192306964,0.3285719829628955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547281100682725,0.0,0.0,0.09356814989391743,0.12814376534346672,0.0,0.13536662175870745,0.12731903193021527,0.0,0.13354880226593416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553279511642426,0.10944973920860564,0.0,0.07401392048222835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15165491290763464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250924608317915,0.0,0.0,0.15848648091910816,0.0,0.0,0.2557157131866764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22615070701638665,0.0,0.0,0.1050425257051805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508682040497821,0.0959956173915228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12003197852164088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15099564303142066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15495810855929673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260578309154798,0.0,0.5371260069755599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313353548765694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912273749663128
addiction,Oh_NiGhTmArE,2019/02/13,"Today is my first year!! Today is a huge day for me. I’ve gone through a rough patch in my life the past couple years and recently I’ve changed my life 100% for the better.  I’ve been through many ups and many downs, I had to completely move away from the place where I called home to many friends and many memories for 25 years to fully commit to this. I’m so grateful to say as of today I have a full ONE YEAR, yes that’s right, 365 days of continues sobriety from any mood altering chemicals or substances, I’ve been completely honest opens and willing taking any recommendations from Hazelden and I owe my *New* way of live to the amazing people I have also made that are on this journey with me. Being open about my situation publicly has been tough as many people can have a negative first impression on someone going through chemical abuse recovery but that has helped me create new friendships and a great amount of support along the way. I just wanna say I can’t thank you guys enough for sticking with me and encouraging what has been the hardest chapter of my life so far and I’m looking forward to helping the next alcoholic/addict going through the same thing as I did, and continuing my sober lifestyle just one day at a time. 😇❤️",7.2019563152896495,6.692270506172843,7.044855967078192,77.84749287749288,64.10288065843622,10.2752769863881,35.15321304210193,9.661875296680813,3.1553332700221604,995,40,192,17,13,316,142,243,0.025,0.7979999999999999,0.17800000000000002,0.9883,1,0,1,0,1,0,17.0,0,1,0,3,7,11,0,0,14,1,19,3,0,1,1,22,30,17,0,1,4,0,1,0,1,1,3,2,1,1,7,14,0,0,0,0,1,6,2,1,0,4,8,4,20,9,38,20,4,43,0,0,1,0,10,16,0,1,21,123,27,0,0.0,0.11825742627148808,0.0,0.1088066179556746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798172766934596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13574717950393564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09377390616126582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827301093576981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10191621912199893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055847611544333,0.0,0.2092958205179523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11043683682903258,0.0,0.19310577818355312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10312944927717016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16979508679109578,0.0,0.0,0.07711223938719032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11344758841690307,0.0,0.0,0.1100398513074684,0.0,0.0988266706089574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13379983059126185,0.0,0.10011663448497496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21149429214514104,0.0,0.0,0.08813323681666108,0.0,0.08381448069154533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09444175469454813,0.0,0.5059536533038685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10608124518824256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19279244224201844,0.1061480775553332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526641693147512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09527905031935832,0.13839008309701428,0.0,0.10427923418575898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854941492022777,0.0,0.0,0.08523639987131057,0.0,0.15874435596829758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121895757774468,0.0,0.0,0.08456790056153095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11326214909929115,0.0,0.0,0.07504399875388873,0.0,0.0,0.09189078127953017,0.0,0.0,0.06630871070296747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058199470977094124,0.0,0.2838219821066171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15844758702917638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25709507315168345
addiction,brohammerhead,2019/02/14,"Booze and food sometimes weed Maybe pills are the natural next step. I mean I’ve been on antidepressants for close to a decade and in therapy for most of that time and I’m still a lonely, fat, miserable fuck. There are later term abortions for babies that may have a shitty quality of life right? Why can’t an adult who is capable of making their own decisions not have assisted suicide? 

The fear of failing at suicide and being committed is what is keeping me alive yet addicted. People say they care but I look around and no one is there. It’s easy to text or call but not catch someone when they fall. They rather leave to bereave than stay through the grey.

So my question is what advice can we be given or what resources can help us save my friends father to kick his habit in a more efficient manner(especially if he's stubborn about it)? My friend is extremely worried.

Thanks in advance.",5.106972477064218,7.8092371743119315,4.7912752293577965,80.12562844036698,71.75229357798165,7.295779816513763,32.00091743119266,8.238735603445708,2.7344524770642202,488,23,79,8,10,149,82,109,0.128,0.63,0.242,0.959,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,2,0,0,3,5,8,1,0,3,0,9,0,0,0,2,16,16,6,0,2,6,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,8,4,0,1,2,0,0,3,2,1,0,1,3,0,8,7,16,12,1,21,0,0,0,0,17,8,0,4,9,56,16,0,0.0,0.22943259631457616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18922347663915653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16471070288011305,0.0,0.0,0.4488190344076453,0.0,0.10116928727210736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3893798912280864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2016470182168089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854542885667981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2169219302322445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1911968562424369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16407115901678415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741198054948577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825040929057904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17827836433660416,0.0,0.0,0.1286462942287279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.225826929460732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329259514003196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866627500799435,0.0,0.0,0.1966515571150141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have many personal experience with addicts in my own family, but I figure the more help the better.  

This is a great company and I really want to do everything I can to help.

addiction,badnewsbaby,2019/02/14,"It’s been over 5 months since I was forced to quit drugs I’m a teenage girl living with my parents currently. I just really need to to tell people about this experience, people that didn’t see it. I smoked pot for the first time a few years ago. I was young, and just tried it because my friends were trying it. I remember after the first puff it was just pure bliss. I smoked occasionally for about a year and a half, just here and there with friends. I’d buy at most 2 grams a month. Normal teenage stuff. The first time I smoked by myself, my parents caught me. It was so stupid to do it out my window, but I kept doing it. And they kept catching me or finding my stash. The summer before sophomore year I got my first real job. Everyone there was a high school or college kid. And that’s where I met her. Let’s call her Jenna. She was older, and loved to party. We started partying together whenever we could. Jenna introduced me to other drugs, and she had an affinity for alcohol. We were best friends for a long time, until we had a drunken falling out last May. I got too drunk and threw up on her boyfriends couch, so she screamed at me and we didn’t talk for a few months. Over the summer I started smoking daily. First once or twice a day with friends. But as the summer went on, I was smoking around 10 times a day, with friends and without. I also was drinking daily. In late summer I was doing Xanax regularly. Then I tried cocaine. I still think about that goddamn euphoria everyday. Smoking weed, drinking dirty sprite, and snorting cocaine everyday. Things got bad.  I got a sugar daddy to pay for my drugs. I got raped by him. In late August, Jenna and I became friends again. For me, when my life is toxic I seem to want to add more toxic to it. That was Jenna. One night we got way too fucked up off anything we could get our hands on. I, being completely barred out and drunk and stoned, had sex with her boyfriend. She found out. I think it was a week later when I overdosed. I was with another friend, and we wanted to get fucked up out of our minds. My mom found us unconscious in my bed the next morning. My friend woke up quicker than I did. I cut myself that morning for the first time in over a year. My friend went to school, and my mom took me to the hospital. I went to a mental institution for 11 days. They kept making me stay longer because I was having extremely violent anger outbursts. Most likely due to the withdrawal from everything I was on. I also got diagnosed as Bipolar 1 for the first time. They concluded that I was manic for a couple months before I overdosed. I went home for two weeks before I went to residential in another state. I didn’t use any substances during those 2 weeks. Fast forward to December, I came home. It was easy at first. I wasn’t back in school yet and wasn’t really around other teenagers. My school situation got complicated but I’m back in public school now. It’s been tough, to say the least. It feels like everyone my age does drugs. And I want to so bad. I crave the release every day.  I’ve drank a little bit twice so far. Not by myself. But god I wish I could just smoke a joint or do a line of coke. I’ve swung back to the depressive side of my bipolar now. I self harmed twice this week. Sometimes I want to die. I’m mostly just lonely though. I doubt anyone read this far but if you did, thanks.

addiction,Motion_ambient,2019/02/14,"Tempted to relapse. I’m a little under a year clean from abusing opiates. I began pill popping in order to deal with severe depression and anxiety. Thankfully the addiction didn’t get so bad that I had to get treatment for it. As hard as it was, I managed to stop all together on my own. 

My grandmother broke her neck and is currently taking morphine for pain. I would never take pain pills from someone who needs them, but they recently discontinued her two other pain meds, which happen to be hydrocodone and tramadol, which are nearly a full 30 pill prescription each. 

Since she is no longer on these meds and they are available in my own home, I’ve been super tempted to start popping again. The temptation gets really bad when I feel down and depressed. I sometimes think about overdosing on them. My family knows nothing of this problem since I did it under the radar and never sought proper treatment for it. 

Should I get treatment for it now? I’m currently seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for general mental health treatment. Is there anything else I should do?",6.308418367346937,7.97516280102041,6.245510204081636,75.22091836734695,66.39795918367346,9.273469387755103,33.38775510204081,9.606745405546679,3.421718367346939,863,38,140,18,14,272,126,196,0.197,0.7609999999999999,0.042,-0.983,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,4,1,6,11,0,0,7,0,15,9,1,0,3,23,32,12,0,5,1,0,2,0,0,3,8,0,2,0,12,9,0,1,3,0,0,0,4,9,0,1,6,3,20,2,27,22,5,24,0,3,1,0,9,11,0,0,12,103,32,1,0.0,0.15492681338721764,0.0,0.14254548848893162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000294895620798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10760266845251196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21835488727208016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13480572606255567,0.22524329684752906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923150588907844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232669774628647,0.0,0.06611515874196806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732625710818025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11562884151286487,0.0,0.11713345812014304,0.0,0.0,0.1389896081646627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13116090580393125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186116099191653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13105383783155228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2904852559890246,0.0,0.1317732797004849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695537832648717,0.2016972157058289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546579929419885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4174070993278804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12511771855623322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08376690417651662,0.0,0.1291077211482212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10419717322811836,0.0,0.0,0.1477192879325633,0.0,0.21632868889099527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107908041120961,0.0,0.12932297633578338,0.0,0.09255116455513024,0.0,0.0,0.10931951832499973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966274416303177,0.0,0.0,0.12038437138498585,0.0,0.1518200819655519,0.0,0.0837844277459896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12773153734043732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0928867106414985,0.0,0.0,0.0842038459586939
addiction,epcool77,2019/02/14,Please save someone the trouble. For the love of god don't be in a romantic relationship when you're in an addiction. I think most standard psychologists recommend a year sober please just abide by that somewhat as an addict who has been in a relationship with addicts and non addicts. Don't put another person through it. Just don't. If they love you anything like I loved my addict I would deny my own issues because theirs were always more important and it's crushing beyond belief  so if you're not dating the Buddha spare someone until you are sober goodness me. ,6.625485175202157,7.817123839622643,6.679865229110515,74.14235849056604,65.32075471698113,9.076010781671158,34.01078167115903,9.23628265651192,3.2199045822102432,461,20,76,8,7,147,77,106,0.081,0.6509999999999999,0.268,0.9709,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,2,2,0,5,7,0,0,8,0,9,8,0,0,0,15,13,8,0,3,5,0,0,1,0,1,5,0,0,1,4,3,0,0,2,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,2,0,10,6,11,9,4,9,1,0,0,3,11,4,0,4,5,55,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7199561005782901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990459404128332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13850174815703828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869400134947722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08051727202623285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11078591853219596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13786153631216275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06452964397968047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3576333075064375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11533078526737775,0.0,0.2899774656777281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13278105287942582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28361789249131625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22382894374007906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08463419015028313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938287906518906,0.0,0.0,0.08505786220631392

addiction,Drawneb,2019/02/14,"My story and now recovery It started off with marijuana 14 years of age. Then with ecstasy and alcohol for a couple years to the age of 16 every weekend. I was found out by my parents after owing money to people coming to my door, coming home with black eyes going to the police cell and dropping down rapidly academically. Then after I was caught I still went out and heavily did drugs and alcohol and overdosed on salvia and woke up with my mam and dad and a doctor near by. I decided to get my life on track then because watching and knowing what my family were going through for my actions was killing me more than any drug. 
That was it for the time being...
I started the gym at the age of 19 started getting rapidly big got a full time job, and started the use of steroids. I felt like there was a barrier what I couldn’t get over of how big I was getting. I eventually stopped after my second cycle over acne and a constant fear of balding. I was constantly hitting the pubs since 18. Then after a several drinks I was pretty wasted and was offered cocaine I took it and was sober after. I then thought wow I can drink more and enjoy the night more so i started doing it more and more every time I drank £50 here and there spending my pay up my nose. Now it comes to my age 21 after a year of heavily drinking even sometimes drinking alone about 10 beers I buy a bag of something to sniff to sober me up to drink more beer. I woke up with sick and blood all over my bed with my nose bleeding, and now it’s time to stop. I’ve got a problem and I need to address it

addiction,MomsPolpetti,2019/02/14,"Getting sober while suffering dp/dr shit, this is hard.

nothing satisfies me, nothing makes me truly happy (''except drugs''), nothing to look forward to, nothing.

I've been sober from everything for 45 days, from benzos, opiates, alcohol, stimulants and a shitload of rcs, i know it's too little time to rebalance my neurochemistry and get back my brain reward system, and i will continue to stay sober, because i know drugs are not the answer and merely a band aid, but it's hard to stay sober while feeling like a fucking ghost 24/7, detached from every emotion i feel (expect anxiety, thank you brain?) and the people i know i love but don't truly feel like (worst part for me), and having a hard time finding motivation towards goals because i don't have a firm sense of self.

But i will keep on, love you all, just wanted to vent, i just hope this fucking disease leaves me for good in the future

addiction,PinkCloud1995,2019/02/14,"What have you lost because of your addiction? If youre clean now, how is it to have some or all of it back? Hello. 23m heroin and fentynal addict. I've been in recovery since I was 17. My longest stint was 1 year 9 months clean. I slipped in October 2017. 

Anyways, during that time I had gained quite a nice little life. I was engaged to a beautiful lady, had a brand new 2017 Ka Optima with a sick aftermarket sound system, my relationship with my parents was going pretty good, and I was driving for Uber making money enjoying little trips here and there. 

Then after the relapse I got the car repod, lost my fiance after she got tired of being lied neglected and manipulated to. Left our apartment as I could not afford it alone. Rented a room. I later weasled my way into getting another new car immediately dropped 2k on rims tires and sound system, moved into a sober living house. Life was getting better. Then began driving for over again with my new whip. Landed a passenger in the tenderloin. Before I could think I had already bought a dub of some good black tar. I smoked some for a few weeks until I was back on the needle. So one day I shot up a speedball and drove down Lombard street about to hop on the GG bridge when I fell asleep and rear ended someone doing 40mph while they were stopped at a red light. So lost the car. Got paid monies for my injuries, blew that on cocaine and heroin and a new computer which I now no longer have as I sold it for drug money.

I'm tired of this guys and gals. Im so tired of it. I want my life back. What are some things you lost because of your addiction but regained thru sobriety? How does it feel today compared to your active addiction? 

Thannks...

addiction,peach821,2019/02/15,"In college, developing a weed habit and disappointing myself Hi, this is my first time posting anywhere on Reddit, I just lurk usually. So here goes nothing...

I’m in college, and I smoke a lot of weed, a lot more than I’d like to. In fact, what prompted me to write this is that I was hanging out with my friends tonight and I took a much larger hit than I was expecting (or wanting) and got uncomfortably high. I mean, usually I at least feel somewhat relaxed. But I feel this looming sense of panic, and it’s horrible. 

Now I’m on the train on my way back to my apartment and trying to figure out how I can convince my future self to just not smoke. I smoke weed about once a day, and I feel so much shame even writing that. I just feel so stupid that I keep automatically doing this habit that makes me feel the way I’m feeling right now. I almost never smoke alone, and I have kept it as a social thing for the past 2 years. But the problem is, all my roommates smoke weed too, and all of their friends, and their friends’ friends... It can act as a really social drug for a lot of people. 

And I wouldn’t consider this issue I have to be getting in the way of my life, per se. I get good grades, I have a part time job, I exercise, I study. Overall my life is pretty normal and happy right now, if that makes sense.

(A bit of background; I experienced severe depression and anxiety in late middle school that evolved into an eating disorder. I was hospitalized, went to ED therapy and rehab, and was prescribed antidepressants which I am still taking today, 7years later. Fortunately, I made a near full recovery and was able to have a mentally healthy high school and college experience (you know, besides this weed thing..) 

The point is, I know what that kind of hell feels like, and I can honestly say I don’t feel like I’m in a pit of addiction at this point. I feel like I have a bad habit, like biting my nails. It’s not really impacting my life and my relationships, only the way I feel about myself. I just want it to stop. 

I’ve had so many moments like I’m having right now, and I’ve even written myself notes while I was uncomfortably high for me to read the next day, describing what it felt like and how much I would rather be sober. That kind of thing usually stops me from smoking for a few days, but that’s as far as I’ve gotten.

god damn it I missed my fucking stop

Anyway, I guess because taking a bong rip once a day doesn’t really feel quite as urgent as anorexia, it’s hard for my to keep myself motivated to quit smoking.

So I’m looking for tips or advice I guess, about ways to make changes like this without necessarily checking into a rehab facility again. I know first hand that I can end up there, and I would just like to nip this in the bud. For my lungs at least...


Thanks guys

addiction,LeahJustyce,2019/02/15,"After getting over my SEX ADDICTION and a few years on I HAVE DECIDED NO...  

Hello my name is Leah Justyce and I suffered from Depression and Anxiety for most of my life. After a suicide attempt in 2017 I woke up the next morning and decided to live. I started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/leahjustyce) last year, I study a double degree in Criminology and Psychological Science and work every day on becoming a better person. I wanted to introduce myself as really my mission is to reach out to many and help one another, as some people can defeat depression and other mental illnesses. I post a vlog most days on my channel and many of them resonate with people as they are stories of the things I did and do in my life to make changes to live a healthy and happy life that I choose to live. I had many addictions that I used for either pleasure or to avoid facing my deep seeded issues, I needed to overcome all of them to feel that I was living my life to the fullest.

So I searched for ways to quit everything that was not healthy for my mind, body and soul. I always say each to their own as we all have different lives but for me, I needed to give up all of my addictions to finally love the life I was living. I hope that some of you will come and join me on a path of self-discovery and possibly if you want to make a change in your life then maybe my stories and things that I have done may help you.

I think we all need to know that we are not alone and that there are many that care. So I am sending you my love and please drop by and check out my channel as there is at least one of the near 300 vlogs I have made in the past 10 months ",8.991685971685971,6.0862317057057105,8.640182325182327,75.48168918918924,62.273273273273276,12.036808236808238,36.9989274989275,10.125756701596842,3.374824281424281,1310,44,271,21,14,422,173,333,0.057,0.809,0.135,0.981,1,2,0,0,0,1,29.0,3,5,4,5,4,12,0,1,15,0,21,15,2,4,4,60,42,29,1,7,6,0,1,0,0,2,10,1,0,1,12,26,0,1,6,2,1,2,3,5,0,2,8,2,50,7,56,32,14,35,1,4,0,3,22,17,0,8,13,199,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2767592686274388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876453594027248,0.0,0.0,0.07041428183660367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873606435349443,0.06473743613552256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09346100374334124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07484340690893744,0.0,0.09399863375404692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628021806987557,0.0,0.17904279368501885,0.07289642942838306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10915147736813097,0.0,0.14577374740647714,0.0,0.0,0.08841448902197319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08660014452210366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07129970876181484,0.0,0.07605495617803645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04278864048378237,0.0,0.0,0.0927018963161229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044212757460533686,0.08117943774925886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09008424983716606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11344390611729815,0.0,0.0,0.08405112583277735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08832588989560723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04650735838706378,0.06898018254642478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3586363079300449,0.0,0.0,0.4483493857530727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275365407355504,0.08007365559266201,0.11297489131458616,0.3431834464451502,0.08501658640730222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528149365077221,0.0,0.08544652262185178,0.0,0.06754639055530462,0.0,0.0,0.18824376610992336,0.0,0.0,0.08999901189340766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1146873701961154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08078356745005112,0.11733581070354568,0.07389076397664959,0.0,0.09289218149891812,0.0,0.0954012985478696,0.08104678506201436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000846847407082,0.0,0.0,0.054212559047721404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672967212870844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828170749962523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05989758751030669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09256536102448827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1124413852918255,0.05422390001291666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308831298179666,0.0,0.0,0.09982733004333164,0.06717091160735826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0616075727492099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10899068112775416
addiction,arieuqesr,2019/02/15,"Findom addiction Hi! I'm not sure if this is the right area to put this. I'm currently addicted to the sexual fetish of financial domination, where you give dominatrix's your money in turn they generally humiliate me and call me a loser etc. I have been addicted to this for a yeafr now. I started last year in January when I was 22, I am 23 now and have probably spent over 10k on this addiction over that duration. The thing is I enjoy doing it in small amounts, ie sending small amounts, makes me feel great. However alot of the time I end up overdoing it and spending hundreds, the most I have sent is 1.5k in a day. My savings account has dropped down from 10k ish to 1.2k during this time. I currently have a share portfolio of 2k. However I really don't want to end up like some paypigs who are in huge amounts of debt and also end up in breaking up with their significant others.  Most of the interaction with the dominatrix's is done through social media such as twitter and formerly Tumblr. Do any of you have advice on this topic?

addiction,photoshopuser1,2019/02/15,"Sleeping Addiction: any advice? You're probably reading this and laughing at me. That's ok, I'll probably delete this post by the end of the week. I don't mind, to be honest IT ALSO SOUNDS SILLY THAT I'M FIGHTING SUCH AN ADDICTION. There's not much information online aside from silly ""depression nap"" memes. It's a strange addiction but it's taking control of my life and I feel like I can't control it. No, it's not narcolepsy. It's my form of escapism. For the past couple of months, I've been addicted to napping multiple naps throughout the day even if I sleep a sound 7-8 hours. Caffeine doesn't work and neither do vitamin supplements. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I can't control it anymore and I succumb to taking several 1-3 hour naps through out the day. It sounds innocent but it's wrecked my work and relationships with family. I know I'm using it as escapism, hell I could be just about to start work or studying (university student) and I begin to slowly drift off because I'm overwhelmed or depressed. Sometimes because I've gotten so used to sleeping my problems off, my brain or something in my subconscious will make me sleepy as hell as soon as I encounter a problem or challenge. A defense mechanism? It feels like one! I always wake up feeling really depressed and shitty. I swear I'm hooked. I'd rather sleep than eat or do anything else. I used to be so motivated to work and study but now I just want to push everything and everyone away by napping it all off. I always tell myself that I will get a good nights rest, which I do, and promise myself to not nap but it still ends up happening. I know this sounds super ridiculous because it's not as harmful as other addictions, but I wish I had more power over myself because this has me feeling so depressed and ashamed of myself. I would like to hear advice from people on this forum no matter what addiction you are fighting, maybe somebody will also be struggling like me? who knows.

addiction,GarthbrooksXV,2019/02/15,"I feel like I'm in heaven right now I hadn't taken a klonopin in 2 months. I don't plan on taking it again, at least not regularly. But today my muscles were so tense from my recent initiation at golds gym group classes... and was really feeling some stress from some other stuff. So I caved and took just 0.5 mg one pill.   


My muscles feel like I got a good massage, I have a nice sense of warmness and well-being, and I feel just a little bit more chill than I should. My neck pain is gone.  


Funny how I would have had to take like 4 pills 2 months ago to get this response. I won't take anymore though. Maybe once a month if I felt too much pain.

addiction,ButteryMucus,2019/02/15,"I feel like I'm wasting my ljfe My uncle commited suicide last year, I was on ritslin at the time and quickly became hooked to abusing it to deal with the pain. I finally quit the ritalin and went through months of withdrawl. Ever since then I've basically been abusing weed instead and I cant seem to go crutch free. I've lost all my friends and I've become so isolated from this situation that I've forgotten how to socialize and how to make friends. This all happens right after I left school and I've been doing nothing but wasting the days ever since. Does anyone have any tips on how to attack these problems that I'm trying to overcome",4.8364216972878395,6.084844015748033,5.5227821522309695,80.60041119860018,69.4724409448819,8.164129483814524,33.0087489063867,8.515128840125781,2.68248801399825,518,24,96,8,9,168,83,127,0.202,0.738,0.06,-0.9524,0,0,0,0,0,1,6.0,0,0,0,2,8,8,1,0,4,0,6,2,0,4,5,20,15,12,1,1,1,0,1,1,2,0,2,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,2,0,1,2,1,4,0,0,5,1,8,5,15,10,2,18,0,1,0,0,4,5,0,1,12,57,14,1,0.0,0.3774816024312127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10832736780315327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11138410997182498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.181223242813048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17593093229530168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027333347901956,0.1642281293290805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13940180776193015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2881863672676217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08054530885023424,0.11380175113981646,0.0,0.17450198897098682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2461448097484423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09053211036670054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14086573985243458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12984825049193024,0.0,0.0,0.17307656916364325,0.0,0.0,0.07782442848316402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17389140517072596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633193074577696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12714928138597012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528496905487719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16950315364567758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15242563846937388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16943188216340715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603869889331155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16121698701896114,0.0,0.14501793276438332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2635441159249765,0.17905641182873885,0.0,0.16238314872466456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17424497502734831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09288731480865628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815215183507472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476698403299792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025819934213571
addiction,cholz,2019/02/15,"A Question About The 12 Step Philosophy It has always been counter intuitive to me that the 12-step program as in AA involves the idea that we must admit that we cannot control our alcoholism, addiction or compulsion. To me the whole point of succeeding in any kind of program like that is to control addiction/compulsion. That there are people who succeed in these kinds of programs looks to me like evidence that people can control their addiction/compulsion. If someone who is an addict begins such a program and then eventually is able to live sober for the rest of their life is that not a case of someone controlling their addiction/compulsion? I'm seriously asking here. I really don't understand and I would like to hear opinions from people more experienced with such programs.",8.952357142857146,9.513809950000002,8.429285714285715,65.79821428571432,60.21428571428571,12.428571428571427,41.785714285714285,11.93303328291395,5.514571428571428,643,34,99,19,8,204,86,140,0.012,0.875,0.113,0.9186,0,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,3,0,3,6,5,8,0,0,9,0,12,4,0,4,1,19,19,6,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,2,4,1,0,0,11,5,1,4,4,0,0,1,3,1,1,0,1,3,11,7,19,16,3,7,0,0,1,0,13,4,0,4,5,75,22,7,0.13780702072148285,0.0,0.0,0.3004599873333081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14727379536009558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114666480730534,0.0,0.0,0.0937134996947069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12883096179421527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6182491668318341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15531852786230754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15556735246634099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2870096115314601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09733717417336248,0.20197664826908399,0.0,0.12168612403872806,0.0,0.11572318982099257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2866141099385385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13027217774732902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15437540182635154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828270622462006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23352688291325466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14346196859667734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538566172631066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789415364395893,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,henrydelamere,2019/02/16,"Best college major to make an impact in the culture of addiction? I'm at a state university in Arizona, currently a social work major. I am also a recovering heroin and meth addict with a long period of sobriety. I was recently told I should consider choosing another major due to my felony criminal history. I don't really care what my degree ends up being in, as long as I can help other addicts achieve sobriety as a career. Can anyone give me advice on what could be something that would work? My felonies are non violent and non dangerous, however for social work you need internships which require a fingerprint clearance card. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

addiction,Built240,2019/02/16,"Time to stop neglecting AMP WITHDRAWL! It’s astonishing how people just say amphetamine addiction can be shrugged off and get over it. It comes with serious side effects there is serious body pain and serious mental effects. I’ve had a long  battle and I just started an outpatient rehab program. They are good with teaching the behavioral aspects and underlying addictions(CBT/DBT) but unfortunately they neglect medications needed to help with the  I find it astonishing that amphetamine/stimulant addiction has no well know withdrawl drug. Opiate users have many options with methadone, Suboxone, naltrexone,etc.. alcohol/benzodiazepine users have gabapentin  yeah nothing for Adderall when doctors hand it out like candy. I recently read some pieces of Dr. Edward Fruitman who seems to be extremely knowledgeable with the importance of medications needed to ease the withdrawal.  He also mentions genetic testing as many people like myself ultra metabolizers.  He brought up Topamax(Topiramate)  in several studies I read they used it in cocaine and methamphetamine addicts during tapering off.  Not only did it help reduce tolerance but it actually increased the positives instead of attenuating them like most medications do.  I’m wondering if anyone has any experience and your thoughts with Topamax for amp tolerance ? 

 He also mentioned transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) which I may try.

I’ve always done my best not to judge her, but when she asked I told her I wouldn’t smoke while pregnant. My fiancé and I have tried for two years, we finally conceived after four rounds of IUI. I quit as soon as I know I was pregnant. With a couple cheater puffs in the first week, but nothing since. I’ve seen my doctor for morning sickness and am on a proven safe RX.... every time I talk to my cousin, she encourages me to smoke and I feel judged for taking an RX instead.

addiction,monicajay1,2019/02/16,"Forgiving my mom Before I start , I’m sorry if it’s confusing or all over the place. My mom got addicted to heroine when I was 6. Growing up she had a lot of different men in and out of the house. When I was 10, one of them molested me and made me touch him. I never told my mom, idk why. I guess I felt like it wouldn’t matter anyway. I always hated her for that happening to me even though I didn’t even tell her. At 12 I was put in foster care. I never heard from my mother when i was in foster care even though before I left she claimed she loved me and was gonna get herself together. I hated my foster mother, so I ran away a lot. That led me to doing a lot of things I wasn’t supposed to be doing like having lots of sex with lots of different people and eventually getting involved w a pimp. At that age I had already completely ran away from my step mom and was a prostitute basically. Once I got in contact with my grandma, she had kept me updated with the things my mother had Been doing in her life. My mom began getting clean when I was about 16. My grandma would always tells me that my mom loved me and wanted a relationship. But because of all the bad things that had happened to me I didn’t care about her getting clean. I hated her. I was so deep in love with this older guy who was abusive and manipulative . At around 18 I got addicted to drugs as well. Cocaine. I hate myself for following in her footsteps, but I did. I was addicted for about 5 years. At 23 I got pregnant, I knew I had to stop using drugs. So I knew I had to leave my fast life behind. I left my abusive boyfriend/pimp ( who I loved more than myself), I gave up the fast money, and I never turned back to the drugs. I let everything go for my baby. I gave Birth to my daughter in the hospital , ALONE . I also resent my grandma for never getting me out of foster care or really doing anything for me other than offer her fucking opinion on ME but never my mother. Everyone feels like I blame my mom for my bad mistake and even though this sound pathetic and weak but, I do. I don’t need a pity party but I do know that if she would’ve been a good mom , I feel like my life wouldn’t have been so bad. My grandma told me that since I have been addicted to a drug I should sympathize with my mother. I feel the complete opposite. When I found out I was pregnant and carrying a child I gave up EVERYTHING &amp; EVERYONE , who wouldn’t benefit my child, with no hesitation. Yes it was hard and I struggled but the love I had for my baby growing inside me was stronger than anything else. So when I was able to get through my addiction and leave the toxic love of my life , it makes me really upset because I wonder why couldn’t my mom do the same for me. Why wasn’t her love for me stronger than an addiction or a man. She always put drugs and men before me. Now she wants to be in my life after all the damage has been done? I want a mother and I want a family but I want to genuinely forgive my family, not just sweep it under the rug because I’m desperate . I’m 24 and I have no one. Sorry if this is confusing or all over the place but I am emotional and just venting. I would just like so advice please.

addiction,exclusiveee420,2019/02/16,"I am addicted to dopamine, what should I do? Hello, I am addicted to dopamine rushes. What I am doing daily to achieve it:  


\-Check all the social feeds and participate in discussions with memes and while doing that, wobble with the knee. 

What it prevents me from doing:  
\-concentrating on one thing only.  


I am sure there are more millennials or Y out there with the same issue.   


What is best to cure this disease? Should I meditate daily or let's say, read a book every Saturday with the phone turned off?  


I need to figure out where this is going, but it feels like I am totally losing the ability to focus.   
If this proceeds, the symptoms will be worse than a drug addiction.

addiction,Kyoko_IMW,2019/02/16,"I'm addicted to sexting a few months ago, I got into sexting with strangers via Discord servers. Even though I never show my face, I almost regret it every time i do it. I have the urge to log in every few days, just to check if someone wrote to me. I found the idea of me talking dirty to a real person very exciting, and it took over my life for a short while, I would stay up late and shave parts of my body because someone told me to. That's when I realized it was going too far

I often told myself that the last time would've been the Last time, but horniness always takes over.

I have gotten better at it recently, by just looking at p0rn and leaving certain servers or at the very least, stop posting in them, but I'm afraid that it won't be enough.

I’ve been clean for three years but have been using suboxone (prescribed) and have run out because I’ve been abusing it a little lately, even though I know it’s not going to get me high. I’m all alone right now, my mum and dad are out of the state on holidays and my boyfriends gone to visit his family. I’m really having a hard time not wanting to get some drugs and use. I’ve already messaged someone who can help me get on. I don’t want to start again, but I also really do want to. Ive got a “kit” stashed under my bed: needles, spoon, filters etc and I can feel myself getting really close to getting high again.

addiction,Ndp5002,2019/02/17,"Meth aftertaste when I cough? Hey everyone I don't know if this is the correct sub to post this but this is getting me freaked out and I really appreciate some answers. So I have never smoked anything (tobacco/weed/anything) in my life until two nights ago when my friend offered me a joint of weed. I smoked it but instantly I realised it's not weed because it smelt/tasted nothing like weed. I panicked and wanted to stop but he told me he will tell me what it is only if I finish the joint so I did.

While smoking it he kept telling me to inhale more and more deeply and I tried, but it suffocated me and made my lungs choke. Afterwards I felt really sick, he still didn't tell me what it is and he wanted me to sleep in his room, I didn't obviously. I managed to walk back to my room with the help of some other friends.

The problem is now whenever I cough I can still taste the whatever it is! The taste is kind of sharp and bitter and smoky but hard to describe. What's going on, I just want to know if this is normal and I'm freaking out or not. Whenever I cough + breathe in the aftertaste I think I feel dizzy and short of breath, but I don't know if it's just placebo or something real. Does anyone have any experience about this?",1.872852941176472,3.8732358196078462,3.3615931372549035,89.88591911764703,79.0392156862745,6.602941176470589,23.958333333333336,7.6454224807358475,1.088950980392157,974,34,209,15,24,320,130,255,0.129,0.792,0.079,-0.9152,1,0,5,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,0,11,8,1,0,8,0,17,11,4,1,3,50,32,28,0,9,16,0,4,1,2,1,5,0,2,0,18,13,2,2,7,0,0,2,7,4,0,1,7,8,33,4,21,24,4,26,0,0,0,0,15,9,0,8,15,138,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13186868517236347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10116337477254186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10401796599785698,0.0,0.2448371760217341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11438892381512672,0.0,0.09068403618932296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301827747556465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.142148625547465,0.0,0.14551794446218894,0.0,0.0,0.07521862139392993,0.0,0.14283500925900894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2298665622721135,0.0,0.07772209227974891,0.0,0.08454496768183317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332616816861403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099712144709526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15491290470031768,0.2452673894049693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10507511791021316,0.07267768048613131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076235925128805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11473455401957755,0.0,0.0,0.1396032162217871,0.1457553383754913,0.1427413112903345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11314033141690305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14247303424107266,0.0,0.0,0.14234530296574222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16932391412944772,0.1906017067942217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14886960117029535,0.0,0.0,0.11452438395111347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23760331732043186,0.124371832667707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3900740725182475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09532078980447548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.142148625547465,0.0,0.10099974632846227,0.0,0.14531902108519354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632313410194316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,SirGoodLeaf,2019/02/17,"Just need to vent I have been struggling with alcohol for most of my life and I really want to quit. I used a lot of other drugs when I was younger and now suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. This was the first weekend in God knows how long that I didnt drink. It was because I tried CBD, the new craze going around that everyone says is a miracle drug. I was skeptable, but also desperate to quit drinking and finding something else to do on weekends when I'm most vulnerable. I didnt feel like drinking when I was on it, but I have become pretty depressed. I spent more money than I wanted to or could really afford to on CBD and I also feel like I'm just trading one addiction for another. I really dont want to take any drugs at all.

addiction,Jizzgernade,2019/02/17,"3 years clean and it feels like day 1 again. have been benzo and opiate free for almost 3 years, I went through all the withdrawals back then but now I am experiencing like my skin is on fire, intense itching, very short triggered anger, lose of appetite, extremely thirsty, twitching, shaking, mood swings.

I was abusing my klonopin to excess of 8 mg up the nose everyday, along with heavy ambian use the same way, for about 1.5 years, I quit cold turkey 3 years ago and haven't touched them since.

I had 2 hernia repair surgeries, one last year and one 2 years ago, for a total of 5 hernias, I was forced to take a percocet after the first one before I left the hospital and again I was forced to take an oxycodone after the second one. I haven't touched any other that that.

I quit all that at the same time 3 years ago, I went through the pain, I did my time then, I survived. I understand I caused this, I did this to myself, I chose to abuse my meds, I took that jump from a plane with no parachute into addiction, I wanted to feel nothing. Now I feel everything 100 fold.

Anyone out there that knows what I'm going through?
Please help me.
What helps?
What can I do to ease this suffering?",5.082992907801419,5.629885072340432,4.981276595744681,87.25333333333334,68.48936170212768,7.798581560283687,28.43262411347518,7.554174236665415,1.4557007092198575,932,30,193,9,15,288,143,235,0.179,0.7090000000000001,0.112,-0.972,0,0,0,0,1,0,34.0,0,0,1,5,7,9,1,1,12,0,14,6,3,3,3,26,28,8,0,1,1,0,7,2,0,0,4,0,1,0,13,10,0,0,5,0,1,6,3,5,0,6,10,10,28,4,28,18,5,39,0,2,0,0,3,7,0,1,27,121,41,0,0.0,0.2673174561704378,0.0,0.12297709007993285,0.0,0.0,0.2999917711742965,0.0,0.11296065879974415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671313305939251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07887779627856788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674219056927221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09599107995577108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11588462559397332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07275166138732657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138432483201516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17111695189619547,0.08058987358988047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09595420791382844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06411123956531829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15122530346457866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0619961849528312,0.09195336616705664,0.0,0.0,0.1225659420049827,0.0,0.0,0.11022432942982216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262030084535427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253039709335608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10824207111227888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057657824921709,0.0,0.12003539127098604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238290254404295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2399698392842593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09331573009652776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.169634766121945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131558203341459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12533355235377505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11743683804117824,0.0,0.0974296697696391,0.0,0.09307820152307307,0.06653692911566424,0.08954153501477709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2091478144410925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085114121475828
addiction,kameelyon1314,2019/02/17,"Addicted gf ""slipped"" what do I do now, and boundaries for a healthy relationship So my (36m) girlfriend (27f) of just over a year, has in the past had an issue with cocaine. Before I knew her she dated dealers and was a heavy addict. Since she has got herself cleaned up. More about her she went thru a slut phase before I met her as well. She basically only has guy friends. She's been married and now separated but is best friends with her husband. Her snapchat is full of guys she talks to everyday, all of whom she admittedly slept with.

  


We live in two separate cities an hour apart. And she still likes to go out and party. Not often but when she does it's often till 4 or 5 in the morning. And everytime she has something I dont like happens. The first time she a while back she got back into coke and broke her clean streak.. she felt terrible and said she isnt that person and will never happen again.. next time she goes out she meets a dude and spends so much time with him that her friends had to remind her she's in a relationship. Of course nothing happened, but she got his snapchat and talks to him all the time now. Also she goes to house parties and i see hes there too in snaps. Then next time she goes out with her husband and his work buddies, gets so hammered they sleep in the same bed, no again I'm reassured nothing happened and ""it's like having a sleep over with my best friend"" which she got mad at me for being upset about. I said have a little respect for me, she said it's her bed!! Then the other day she goes out again, and of course I'm up all night, not sleeping at all because I knew something was gonna happen. I asked her to let me know she makes it home safe and she doesnt respond till 6:30am. Said she had a couple bumps of coke, after 7 months clean. And this time she feels really bad, shes worried shes gonna lose me. I said we have different ideas what a healthy relationship entails. Now I've always been told she has a life outside of me, which I agree. I'm not trying to change her, just think a little consideration for me when she's out with friends (or even randoms like last time). So basically she said she would do anything to not lose me, and I said I'm not going to change you but I'm going to give you a list of my expectations of a relationship. Now she may not agree with them all, and room for negotiations, but I have zero boundaries for her. I hate to set ""rules"" for being with me, but I feel like I need to do this for myself more. This is what I will allow and what I will not. So the advise I'm looking for is a list of rules I can bring up in our relationship, some of which are zero tolerance, others may be things I just dont think are ok..

addiction,ominous_tones,2019/02/17,"Need advice for addiction evaluation Hey guys, not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I'm hoping that someone might know something about this topic.

So I'm thinking about going to get an evaluation by an addiction center for alcohol abuse. I've been working the steps and am not physically dependent on alcohol as I'm 21 days sober from alcohol. 

However, I am currently tapering off a research chemical benzo, diclazapam. Now I am on the equivalent of 8mg of Valium a day unperscribed obviously. The facility I was going to go to will do a UA, which I'm sure will show the presence of Benzos. My question is, how would the center treat this? I am comfortable right now tapering off at a rate of 2mg a week until I jump off, but I have never been evaluated in this way. Thus, I am wondering would they require inpatient for something like this? My plan would to be honest about it, but am absolutely certain I do not need inpatient treatment. 

In addition although my dose is low, if I did do inpatient, I have no clue if these doctors know the dangers of tapering too quickly off of benzos. Otherwise, I think I will just stick with AA, meditation, and exercise as that is what has been working for me. 

Anyone have experience getting an evaluation when in a similar circumstance? I would greatly appreciate any input. Thank you!",6.987499999999998,7.427415130952383,8.334222222222222,65.23300000000002,64.35714285714286,12.593015873015876,38.62539682539683,12.10132525352546,5.257094920634922,1071,55,181,37,15,371,145,252,0.07400000000000001,0.809,0.117,0.9199,2,0,5,0,1,0,29.0,0,1,1,4,11,12,1,0,16,0,31,8,0,3,6,38,49,15,0,10,10,0,0,1,0,8,8,0,0,1,12,4,3,1,6,2,0,5,5,2,1,0,5,0,19,10,34,35,0,32,0,1,0,0,5,15,0,8,11,134,31,5,0.0,0.15254707770855785,0.0,0.28071186948352306,0.0,0.12581249943917855,0.0,0.412782109076025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08755405978887386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002462832591591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16606552377190414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178054592590305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12594169419953594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13453257623478398,0.0,0.21951388549187004,0.0,0.0,0.1419467536009255,0.0,0.1274822248071996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12787728184349542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14151469161974672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06290049137750338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365828496429011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19093221255209195,0.09929953429357567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13451580118278947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233064099165552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14422888063585174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10995135041173686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10908901457903444,0.19823527600349136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24268971793752686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11853522095405393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16499493316486216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219534253934977,0.1032750648974764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13962331639317954,0.18746230621153928,0.0,0.0,0.3658397395912637,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have an addicting personality and thc makes me lazy. It’s hard to “limit” so I’m just going to quit cold turkey. I’ve done it before and it was hard, but wish me luck on quitting this time. I know what it feels like to be free from something like thc. It’s a good feeling.

addiction,blergster,2019/02/17,"Business partner says he’ll drug test, but I suspect he’ll try and forge results There is a guy in our business who has a history of drug abuse, but has been clean for a number of years. 

Recently he has been behaving oddly and started drinking again and there are lots of signs he’s abusing drugs again. So obviously we are very worried about him. He also has a wife and two adorable young children which he has a lot of responsibilities (driving them to and fro places) and so we are worried about them and their safety as well.

In the past, he has mentioned multiple times that if anyone ever thinks he is ever using drugs again, he will happily take a drug test. Currently he seems to be in a constant state of lying about all kinds of things,  so obviously we cannot trust him. 

We would like to all come together and ask him to take a drug test. Does anybody have any experience with this? How to make sure of the results are not forged, what kind of place to go to, that sort of thing? We want to get him help, and we have to protect ourselves. His behavior is causing a lot of havoc and damaging business relationships etc. thanks all",5.0858108108108135,6.063775058558563,5.4369549549549605,82.44272972972976,68.68468468468468,8.442522522522522,30.56576576576577,8.648137234880735,2.2427581981981985,901,35,178,14,15,287,128,222,0.141,0.71,0.149,-0.3382,1,0,7,0,1,0,21.0,7,0,3,0,16,9,0,0,11,0,21,7,0,6,8,46,36,19,0,3,4,1,0,1,1,4,6,1,1,3,8,18,1,1,3,1,0,3,2,1,1,1,2,1,16,8,28,29,7,22,0,1,0,0,35,5,0,6,14,119,24,3,0.0,0.23110737093408185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07799239994195205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663217836629751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06819322757355295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09117468886600072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10018721387064188,0.0,0.08401097534484775,0.0,0.1053921659456084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08534663699587512,0.0,0.0,0.09553944534675557,0.6786029549571851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876851518332993,0.0,0.17643772106853994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09540023406100953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05095389316144476,0.0,0.055426907900167056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656717866568043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06537037050084059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2031189682083675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047646822905677934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24874220089555976,0.0,0.0,0.06510010766810666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310066825677207,0.0,0.0,0.20379015860165592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09629626192362434,0.10470762476754532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07755747760447948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878502412731322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06903019512756749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09191815324779773,0.0,0.14665650862869484,0.0,0.0,0.08978986582135318,0.0,0.0,0.12958536545020474,0.0624914383709572,0.0,0.0,0.05686884600546014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06621451035093154,0.0,0.09526982171361344,0.0,0.0,0.08423211545556811,0.0,0.08047008509446134,0.057524020235117976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08768859039579713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19808704205496103,0.0,0.06928046547184277,0.0,0.0,0.06280426556445823
addiction,bigsiswiz,2019/02/17,"My mom is a meth addict, do I (24F) tell my little brother? My mother’s addiction got to the point where I have temporary guardianship of my 11 y/o brother. He has been with her the last 3 years and he knows she’s a wild one. He wanted to stay with my mom to help her make good choices he told me when I was taking him in. But I told him that’s not his job. Breaks my heart. We got her into rehab for a month and I explained to him that just like I tore my ACL I had to go to rehab and he knows that my mom is hurt so now she has to go to rehab. It makes sense to him and he’s happy. 

She only lasted in rehab for a month and stayed with my grandma for 2 months until she disappeared and hasn’t tried seeing us. She will message us on facebook and tell my brother she has money for him and that she’s gonna see him but she never delivers. 

It’s his birthday soon and she’s telling him she’s gonna get whatever he wants but I know she’s not and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to tell him not to trust her or that she’s sick and I don’t know where she is at. 

My brother is an incredible kid and helps me more than my 22y/o sister. He’s been through so much but he’s a freakin champ and an A/B honor student. I just don’t know what to tell him anymore. I want to shield him as much as I can but I don’t want him to be completely angry in the future",-0.15085707949883442,1.3107467427652717,2.2515777802417136,98.02073954983926,83.18006430868166,5.189976715822153,18.11963632331744,5.935793293072707,-0.5261042022397158,1051,23,270,7,29,360,138,311,0.057,0.865,0.078,0.478,1,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,3,0,0,2,11,7,0,0,10,0,23,8,1,3,1,46,49,26,0,4,12,9,0,1,0,3,7,0,0,1,9,18,0,0,8,0,1,3,10,1,0,1,8,2,62,6,34,37,3,28,0,1,2,0,63,10,0,1,13,176,71,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137865121941084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724314985827087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280767917895653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051229130963788234,0.0,0.11145261520012874,0.0822429836492624,0.15684536910567445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10438023090512516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11619437817577052,0.13144696366686684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10496875917433104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09730339473012363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3772151259740443,0.1598540787116135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04790419689638863,0.09827579671816612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309035182422394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3445187302748367,0.23479713231940466,0.0,0.1441618403368728,0.0,0.07562523500763076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644388006011445,0.07457443161181014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09269265689490026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15627257292435764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20902488400612226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372435177255766,0.0,0.4285172799751107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873894626583798,0.0,0.0665721814763644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358936074553487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23133899165281416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06314351556007658
addiction,comicsans987,2019/02/17,Addicted to Phone From the moment I wake up I get on my phone and I rarely turn it off through the day. On average I spend about 10 hours a day on my phone. I think one of the reasons I’m addicted is because I can’t think of anything to do when I’m not on my phone. ,0.4986885245901647,1.5341641147540983,2.9024262295081966,95.9831475409836,79.98360655737704,6.847213114754098,23.67540983606557,7.554174236665415,0.7100859016393448,205,7,54,3,5,71,38,61,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,3,3,1,1,0,5,9,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,9,0,13,9,0,11,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,0,5,34,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.603530385327808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2277921267164043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16874160859427267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3570407968003808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14462248732750466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726033862695245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18757451124393548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2846081350842211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547390275065309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30109122277815875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,michaelwallaceAZ,2019/02/17,"Too smart for my own good (not trying to be cocky) My dad suffers from extreme depression and addiction issues. Growing up I was constantly reminded how my pastor father threw it all away and the addiction/depression traits are genetic. I’m easily the most successful and accomplished of my siblings as I’ve worked in my career field for 4 years (1 year part time) , held executive positions in college organizations, and moved out while
My brother and sister have been in and out of community college at home and had kids. But I can still remember coming home my first time after going to college, after I’d been dragged into my dads affair, subsequent drug spiral, and eventually suicide attempt (only person on earth who he told any of it too) telling my mom and step dad I was worried I may have my dads bipolar tendencies. Ill never forget being told “do you really want to do (not listing career for protection)? Because your strong, and you can handle it. If you seek help and you dont need it that path isnt possible”. I was 18. Im in my career (which is high stress but i love it). My step dad is dead, my dads wife left him, and my moms bounced through three marriages in 2018. I moved 1400 miles away and lived alone for my job to help them and yet when i come home im the alcoholic and irresponsible family member. I’m the family embarrassment. And if they only knew about more than the alcohol who knows. But every time I consider opening up, I remember these words “your strong, you can handle it, dont ruin your career.” So for them I keep it together when im with them and support them, and deal with my issues alone.

addiction,marijani101,2019/02/18,"Out of my wits... I (23M) have been battling addiction for a long time, but now now I am almost 2years free from them. I attribute it to my girlfriend(22F) who never liked me while I was high, so I had to quit for her and myself. But recently she confessed to using drugs while I wasn't there (I traveled to another country for a month on work) and it was her first time using them. I am sad and very disappointed that she let her friends influence her. I am also worried since she is in university and the university does random drug tests, that she may get caught and expelled.

It's her first time using drugs and I am really scared that she might like them. I am even more scared that my worry for her could make me relapse into drugs again.",5.313978978978977,5.5220862837837865,5.653063063063066,83.82226726726729,67.91891891891892,8.739939939939939,27.93093093093093,8.515128840125781,1.736808408408408,582,17,121,8,9,186,89,148,0.19,0.74,0.07,-0.9617,0,0,4,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,3,4,7,9,1,2,3,0,16,5,0,6,1,23,22,12,0,1,2,0,0,2,1,2,5,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,5,0,2,6,0,31,5,14,12,1,21,1,2,0,0,17,5,0,4,16,93,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14065040565372233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129194490394665,0.0,0.0,0.10317692577931104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352882977614187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030116504551741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129059195176859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5984870899331222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08521622756064477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21948800802636384,0.0,0.0,0.09968022124438818,0.0,0.06740741478398142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363162887856354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13193128013679864,0.0,0.1260649169462156,0.0,0.0,0.1141782840786049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861215834119296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368694045104708,0.0,0.0,0.10298221207728456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950786766027307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13722822363926296,0.0,0.0,0.08265325811204742,0.0,0.1273912878269381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583422501777261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10672634458514962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22569709514622635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.334294523481591,0.0,0.10645468024353087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09392780384365952,0.2620513287340756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,NostalgicDreamscape,2019/02/18,"I need help This will be long but for those willing to read thank you. For the past 7 to 8 years I have lived with my father who is an addict to methamphetamine. About 3 years into living with him it was discovered he had stage 3 cancer in front of his brain in his nasal cavity due to snorting meth his entire life. He quit during the chemo and radiation which, due to being focused at his head, caused alot of alteration him and his personality already. After he beat his cancer, he started using again and has used semi regularly to very regularly ever since. His longest time clean since is 10 days. Im 18 so I grew up, as a child, with him. Our relationship is horrible and due to his addiction, in the past, hes used things like suicide and such to prevent me from leaving or going to child services and me being the child I was not wanting to see my dad either die or go pack to prison for the fourth time, I never sought out help. The one time I did I asked a teacher to mandatedly report him for me and he attempted to end her career if I didnt drop the case. I've had to deal with emotional manipulation and abuse which has caused an extreme amount of stress (im underweight) and trauma. Ive tried hard the past 6 years to get him help and to help him and its all been for nothing. Im not in the position to move out and hes convinced meth is the only thing that helped him live after the cancer. I dont know what to do and Im tired of day in and day out waking up in hope that today will be a better day and instead it's him in a bad mood because hes either coming down or hasnt gotten high in a while which means hes just going to do it again. I hate seeing my dad, the man i once knew as an extremley intelligent man, nothing but a shell of his former self now. I want resolution in our relationship and I want to forgive him so I dont hate him anymore and I stop suffering day in and day out because of this. All we do is fight and argue and i beg him to see him for what he really is and he just accuses me of being crazy and having mental illness and its driving me insane. If anyone knows what I can do to help my situation please.

addiction,fuzzgrub1,2019/02/18,"When your friends use drugs I’m hoping someone can help me understand this. I had a drug problem in high school. Mostly experimenting with all types of drugs and moderately abusing. I got in terrible trouble by parents and school. I was shamed for a while. I still feel guilt to this day.  

Now I struggle with others using. I smoke marijuana often and I’m kinda okay with it. So when others do it it’s fine. But recently my bf opened up about taking mushrooms and I freaked out. I want to cry because I have so many feelings relating to the past. This has happened to friends ‘recreationally’ using adderall or LSD. I’m pretty open minded but I get terrified by ones I love using almost any substance. 

Please help me.

addiction,puffysmile8,2019/02/18,"Never told anyone about this I have absused my sleepingpills for over 5 years. It started because i wanted to self mediacte and I didnt want to feel so anxious. Fast forward the pills started to be a huge part of my life, i couldnt walk outside befare popping one,be around family or friends, and suddenly the pill was giving me alot more problems then I started with.

addiction,iNhab,2019/02/18,"I have addiction and almost no control Hello.   


So this post is about asking for your advice, help, suggestions on what to and how to.  


I'll go more into details and share a bit of my story so that the picture will be quite clear.  


I'll start from this- I have Computer (phone less, but when there's no computer, Phone is a substitution for me) gaming addiction, porn addiction, some habits like biting nails but these two are my main issues right now.  


Context- I'm 23 years old. Been playing video games since 8 years old. Even though most of the time I'm not even liking the games I'm playing, I still do because, I guess, it's easier, I don't want to stop using my computer (or give it away, which is a good decision since i've done it for a month and things were way better but then came back to it). I call my computer usage addiction because there's a correlation. If I start playing games with my computer (or use more of it than less), my other activities in life goes down- less to no physical exercise, less to no meditation, less to no being energetic, motivated or overall no desire to do/aim for anything. There was once a time where I shut myself in my own room, stayed there for so long without almost any other activity that I became severely depressed, suicide thoughts, no happiness, not for even for brief periods of time.   


It feels like I can't let go of it when consciously I understand that it would be way better for me. All there is to computer (or i'd say 80-95%  to it) is free time, gaming, watching youtube videos and that's it. And I sometimes even hate it that I spend so much time on it, like literally feeling of hate and disgust creeps upon me, not very strong but it's still there. And yet only when my state is very bad, only then i'm willing to do something. I guess it's like any other addiction- when it's good, we don't think about doing something else or dropping it of and changing for something. Only when it's really bad, when we destroy ourselves, feel down, no health, no energy, no happiness, pain or something- only then we think about quiting whereas we consciously do understand where that path leads us.

&amp;#x200B;

Next addiction- Porn/masturbating. Now I know that it may not be at that level where everything is falling apart but I tend to read a lot and learn more and more about world and myself. That's why I care about it- I know where it leads and I see that barely I can control it. Most of the times my urges to masturbate and watch porn are way stronger than my will. It scares me because there were days when i've done it enough so that my penis started hurting for like hours on end. And I tend to not find many women attractive/sexy and in a sense I don't need the love or their affection. I don't seek for it and it feels like it's because i'm stuck in the porn cycle where the dopamine rush and that most satisfying (or one of the most satisfying) natural rewards (sex) is being felt on, mostly, a daily basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that (or because of that), I barely have any discipline. I set out to go work out, one week and im almost off of it. Only good thing where I actually improved a lot is staying at the job for nearly a year and never once thinking about quiting it (longest i've worked somewhere was for 3 months). I'm not saying that everything is bad, it's somewhat okay but there's a lot I want to improve and get better at. And the worst areas right now are addictions and having no discipline to do anything that I know I should but I don't do.   


And adding to the porn thing- first time I saw it was at 8 years old, I'd say, and then once or twice through a couple of months turned into a couple of times during the month into a couple of times during the week and yeah, it just always increased. And it went to from just naked bodies pictures (or even half naked) to hardcore stuff. It's not good. I'm sick of it to myself yet I do it. And consciously I understand that while I'm doing it yet I often find no power to oppose it.  


What should I do? I want to eventually quit it because I can't really do it half-assedly. That's why I quit drinking for the most part. If I start drinking, even one beer or whatever that is, it turns into drinking spree for a couple of days or weeks.

addiction,tj1311,2019/02/18,"40 days clean, gf of 2 years cheats on me then dumped me. Long story short, daily smoker through all of college. Was never a problem because I maintained a 3.5 GPA, had a gf who didn't mind, and had a good life. Over winter break, everything changes. I get an amazing summer internship offer contingent on drug screen, so I immediately stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

GF of 2 years who I loved too much goes on study abroad trip, gets drunk and cheats on me on my 21st birthday. Comes back, says she needs to be independent and that we're done. Waited a week after breakup to reach out when she was drunk and let me know that she misses me, but that she's casually sleeping with him.

Problem is, I'm back at college. I have a roommate who is a daily smoker, and always offers. He offers me adderall casually (free, he likes me). I always refuse, but lately it's so hard to focus with all of this going on that I've considered it.  I have a prescription for Xanax, but I don't want to create a new addiction during this period. I'm at my lowest, I know I have a future but with cheating/breakup it almost feels justified.",3.4503196347031952,5.2330714977169,4.5650456621004585,84.00364155251144,73.7488584474886,7.0584474885844735,25.40867579908676,7.793537801064563,1.4136045662100458,874,29,169,12,18,286,131,219,0.129,0.767,0.103,-0.5546,1,0,3,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,0,6,13,3,0,11,0,14,8,1,1,3,30,28,13,0,4,4,0,2,1,3,0,4,1,1,0,12,10,2,3,3,4,1,3,3,6,0,0,6,4,24,8,24,20,3,33,0,1,1,1,19,11,0,1,19,105,36,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15264732361016953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14021426452532554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2330231262626789,0.3034328755393302,0.34029007691302243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2153403243787328,0.0,0.08535760770222049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14812730610567307,0.12061866879652244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09030418911156904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14329363223619682,0.0,0.0,0.16238391220578774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12584495072677376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07080057137554778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463139961869427,0.0,0.07957912426302541,0.11744586888041116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12543440747780712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15390755629263325,0.0,0.1579536835250738,0.0,0.0,0.14318449150390242,0.09890341311143064,0.06840887547937491,0.0,0.0,0.1239172357732863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12637753695644474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138478239274047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293408535595472,0.10382635864549927,0.1079954914164418,0.1352364905437146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2679689841646926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113530662567428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401255783206551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11706671370353353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259005107491202,0.0,0.1123191711221294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34029007691302243,0.18034231541850115

addiction,ellelitellelit,2019/02/19,"How to STOP weed when your SO is a daily user Hello, I’ve been smoking weed regularly since I was sixteen (I’m 40) with occasional bouts of abstinence lasting several weeks. Since 30ish I’ve been mostly smoking multiple times daily. I’m highly educated and have a stable well paying job but I’ve noticed in the last few years that I’m much more irritable, unable to control my moods, I eat like there’s no tomorrow (I’m fat still but have been about 80 pounds fatter) and have little motivation or drive. Since legalization in Canada in October, I’ve been experimenting with oils but all that has done is make me more dependent on it. We also have a buddy who grows so we get a full for about $150. We just bought three oz.

My issue is that my husband is a regular user (5-6 fat j’s per weekday, more on weekends) and I usually smoke just as much, plus edibles. I want to stop and he’s not ready, or doesn’t want to. I’d like to quit cold turkey but it seems impossible since it’s around all the time. I also suffer from pain and chronic illness but I want to switch to cbd. Anyhow...any tips for how to move forward with my addiction while hubby still uses? He’s supporting my choice but doesn’t want to stop right now but would at some point.

addiction,zierquitte,2019/02/19,"phone addiction I (F19) am pretty addicted to my phone. It’s all about social media, mostly Instagram. Does anyone have an idea of someting that can shift my focus off of social medias? Has anyone of you dealt or does anyone deal with the same addiction?
I already tried deleting apps for a day and then re-download, using this screen-time application of apple etc., however that does not address the problem at its source. My goal is to be less interested in it in general. 
I would love to hear your thoughts about this topic!

addiction,InspiredLife008,2019/02/19,"In case you commit to quit something, but then talk yourself out of it **Procrastination kills more dreams than failure ever will!**

Based on my research for overcoming procrastination, I have found the most powerful technique there is - at least for me, anyway. Want to know what that is? It's doing more of what scares me. It's doing more of what makes me feel vulnerable. Simply put, it's taking action, taking action in the face of adversity.

This is what I have found works best for me. Here is some good content on overcoming procrastination.

addiction,SiLvErOvErEvErYtHiNg,2019/02/19,"Self Medicating Again. Yes... Marijuana is addicting. Single m27. 

I dont need your 2 cents. I don't want to hear what a loser i am. I dont want to hear ""i dont want this"" i really dont fucking want to hear that Marijuana isn't addicting... It is... Im that guy.

Im here to rant. Share my story. So if you're reading, just do so and leave me alone and keep your opinions in your pants. I dont want to hear it, i dont care, i understand the truth.

If you read, thank you. If you made it this far, also thank you.

Over the past week I have been in a slum. I've been Jobless. I tried to make a transition and it didn't work out. I warned my employer of my 2 weeks because this was gonna happen. Start dates, pay, benefits, and everything was talked about. But no, the company I interviewed with pulled the plug and went with somone else. Had nothing to do with a drug test, Or using. They simply went with another person. This whole thing was the biggest mistake I've made in a while. 

My current employer had already replaced me. They have no regard because it's a grocery retail position. Go figure 2 part timers get paid less and have no benefits. So you can already guess that's what they did, it's been taking a long time to find a job, ive been worrying I may have no choice but to find another late hour retail job that will hire me, like... Tomorrow... My degree is worthless. I owe a ton of money, i cant seem to place myself in a career. Im 2007 Brittany stressed out.

So now, I've been off track with my addiction. I've let it become a problem again. I know... I know.. I know... I take responsibility. I have been contacting my therapist, but even if i go twice a week i still have to wait in between appointments. 

Any of the aa groups make me so uncomfortable. I dont need a sponsor. I wont check in, in busy. Last thing i want to do. I dont want to hang out with you. I dont want a hug. Im here to learn. All that crap really spoils it for me. I have trust issues and social anxiety. I keep my circle small for a reason. I just feel like using after those meetings. I got people telling me to get rid of those people who i know care, care about me more than some of my family does. 

You might ask. Do I want sobriety? Hell yeah i do, also, hell no i dont. Rehab was only full of those judgemental people that would tell me what i wanted based on my ability to control myself. I dont want to hear what i do or dont fucking want based on that. I also feel everyone there was thinking about how easy quitting marijuana should be. I know there's worse out there.. 

I learned a lot about myself from that experience, just by the way people viewed my particular circumstance. I really found myself saying ""yeah okay dude, i dont know you, you dont know me. We don't  know each others needs, so why dont ya just shut up..."" To myself. I couldn't believe that for the first time in my life I've wanted to actually fight somone (meaning stand up for myself, not physically).

I dont need earfulls from people that have been fucking sober for less than a year. I also dont need earfulls from old men that think they're so damn smart because they've been sober for x amount of years. So PSA for anyone who's like this on here, keep your damn mouth shut unlees you are asked for advice.

The minute i got out of rehab i smoked, I've kept it under control, (whatever the hell i think under control is, is most likely different than you) up until these past few weeks. I cant seem to ditch it. 

So, don't tell me im not doing enough, dont tell me i dont want it, dont tell me you know me. I dont want virtual hugs. I've heard all the advice. Im hearing all the advice. Im getting help... Yes. Im okay. It wil be fine. Constantly working on this... Im honest to those around me. I'm not ""jerking myself off"" as my dad likes to say. 

Addicion itself is a brutal conniving bitch. It's bloody painfull. Im tired of the nights where i fiend at 3 am. Im tired of the using dreams and im tired of the dependency. I'm really really tired of the judgment from everyone else too. Im tired of the ultimatums. So if you dont want to be here, go.",-0.12701906974231747,2.0873910404624283,2.254826859705041,93.29529090810871,89.46242774566473,5.5920263627032565,18.026308681324625,7.073111158540453,0.19274447625736,3170,86,718,51,107,1077,338,865,0.168,0.76,0.071,-0.9973,8,1,2,0,1,0,151.0,1,18,3,8,38,40,13,1,35,6,82,20,2,13,4,118,171,36,0,31,17,1,2,5,0,7,13,9,0,4,45,22,0,8,25,3,8,7,39,18,1,2,27,12,111,22,93,132,18,73,3,2,1,5,54,35,10,17,34,444,156,15,0.0,0.0,0.026754238570067243,0.08966305471010175,0.0,0.0803723265509573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02839489601987596,0.060508876646623036,0.08769884260646059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018643943740569446,0.05749651408131856,0.020973304008202586,0.0,0.0,0.01917003174748659,0.0,0.0,0.024406214338188046,0.05126085807401483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0501379498069216,0.030279018778521988,0.0,0.03088864842283548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838578735039168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029627152710062356,0.092248737281319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028644074706724795,0.0,0.0,0.02399208541621602,0.0,0.7068943385359452,0.0,0.031794066784799534,0.0,0.04580540379272089,0.0,0.0,0.028328244569733044,0.0,0.018108129487067616,0.0,0.0,0.052394673140650105,0.02463989636403304,0.02681828651818306,0.025845536189569696,0.0,0.027724890528113527,0.01958612573033702,0.0,0.0,0.05011578689288579,0.02332019020304224,0.0,0.030060428210153863,0.0,0.07603745478753064,0.042971470231822205,0.0,0.04674374370820788,0.0,0.043854450145353135,0.0,0.0302020151408986,0.02714633031248757,0.024244038990727083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18540017637372394,0.0,0.018376488728216157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026999416468448882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38498435229432937,0.028615370814154124,0.054412660029392525,0.07310628614837009,0.0,0.0,0.13560494852244906,0.022347847326836343,0.030926647194809295,0.02902977790411756,0.0,0.02803490335701109,0.0193648599728549,0.06697080782571385,0.0,0.0,0.02426245812436577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023308257323961752,0.0,0.05188370816160543,0.0366010284354511,0.0,0.0,0.029864259270277724,0.0,0.02761891879879581,0.0,0.029084236308508662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10164375694478106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025728229362589432,0.0,0.0263065658212347,0.0,0.02876867086332286,0.0,0.0,0.02085124165211873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029689053163189587,0.05234369539906353,0.09503464208030417,0.02393875242504777,0.028644074706724795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02623358331208951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029160484030716045,0.05484720194464091,0.0,0.08781754034792504,0.028188401012194237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043604896287661926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049917324396654326,0.02860105682710032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027947344707392043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01940531456299447,0.0,0.021894598171793938,0.0,0.031405143581250614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041227113401477375,0.022036088395534337,0.11981475639506753,0.05048227337652676,0.0,0.03183230013022921,0.03642818587829233,0.052701546772745134,0.0,0.0,0.031973192123564934,0.15755433927326634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018613787772437343,0.0,0.0,0.028541212100084062,0.0,0.0710363353472111,0.0,0.0,0.25873238933255993,0.021761688966180692,0.087966429170513,0.0,0.0,0.050830150332718864,0.024738839727880955,0.030609187851403045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03991861369893301,0.027842463394649592,0.02793943144762696,0.019475668916585327,0.0,0.0,0.035310244362599115
addiction,beDeadOrBeQuick,2019/02/19,"Worried about sideffects of game addiction. Hi! I am 24M and i am addicted to gaming. I really spend lots of hours playing games every day since i enrolled to university. The outlook of course is not good. I feel like my life is on hold since all the time is wasted on gaming. I came to realise after all these years that this needs to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I always wanted it to stop, i just didn't make enough effort and put myself in discomfort. What worries me now and always, was the fact that this behaviour has an impact on my health.

I am mostly concerned about my brain and my eyes. They are the ones that feel mistreated. I am worried if i can recover by following any healthy diet or habits. I feel that i lost so much and stupid like everyone feels after they had enough. I really wanna change this now.

Aside from that it feels that i have wasted so much potential and it hurts..

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to add that i study Computer Science and i am sitting in front of a screen most of the time. 

Should i stop playing at all and fight through it. In the end i will follow what feels right to me but it hasn't helped so far. Do you have any advice?",2.1620163280805045,4.464513532751095,3.2362749193089044,89.59375925574335,79.61135371179041,6.4280235428137456,21.74691475223087,7.586124646067393,0.8887697360926525,905,27,183,14,23,290,130,229,0.123,0.856,0.021,-0.9353,0,0,0,0,1,0,30.0,0,1,2,2,8,10,2,1,8,0,20,7,2,1,4,38,34,14,0,6,5,0,6,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,18,10,1,4,6,6,1,5,3,5,0,1,5,8,30,5,27,27,10,28,0,2,2,0,10,9,0,5,15,132,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385188233436601,0.0,0.10690196101564982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18205495050138076,0.2370642692113425,0.26585984877172897,0.14878808906958915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212377865548565,0.0,0.12512158462683276,0.0,0.0,0.11572803872939146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055233075982946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689370516003318,0.2260737017273261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09217210351954044,0.10453398973012767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318879475348253,0.07815358864638335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09175742420309033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11628441611116258,0.0,0.0,0.07332683148282808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10773449110965312,0.0,0.11711227555540543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07727068238764309,0.10689217537330227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11942028319193065,0.09300583382549407,0.0,0.0,0.07302367399664407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16083948503255993,0.08111685259358029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413057038853982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997469314342237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14016566663121913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09342485864066137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18098946826283965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743836001663351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12758111222917592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12905094787373278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3332953838354617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26585984877172897,0.07044839676086269

addiction,hreamer,2019/02/19,Sex Addiction or not I am concerned someone I am close with has a sex addiction. They have been sober for over 2 years from drugs but they have made some less favorable decisions in the last 6 months. I am concerned they are developing a sex addiction. They actively sought out a prostitute and paid her for sex and oral sex on a few occasions while having a beautiful girlfriend. They also were caught pleasuring themselves in their car just a block away from their house. All while pulling away sexually from their girlfriend. What are symptoms of sex addiction?

addiction,redisk,2019/02/20,"Microtransactions in Android and Facebook I am a 37 yo single father of 2, growing several enterprises and getting my life in real order and finally know who I am. I love me and like me and have real joy for the first time. I've lost 90lbs. Been over 10 years since my last cigarette. I still neglect to prioritize solving my porn addiction and I'm really coming to grips with the fact that I am addicted to these games.

I never stay on one for long and after a few months and several hundred to couple thousand in phone bills I take a break then move on to another in a few months. I know I have an emotional reaction to speeding up and getting highly ranked fast. Especially when I'm stressed or tired. I lie to myself constantly about how it will only be $5 or $20. I'm on Sprint who allows all kinds of billing to the phone.

In my addict brain I also keep telling myself that it at least limits me to 200-250 max wasted a month. But that is still crazy. I'm on disability and this is stopping me from repairing my credit or building up to be able to move.

This isn't okay and I understand that I'm not okay.

I don't know what to do to disable this ability with the phone to help me get clean.

Please help and direct me to tools and strategies.

Thank you",3.211887159533074,4.638208817120624,4.802822957198448,83.51598540856034,73.66926070038909,8.097198443579767,26.468677042801556,8.697196308434329,1.8747651361867697,994,35,204,19,20,335,150,257,0.08199999999999999,0.787,0.131,0.9174,0,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,4,6,11,0,1,10,2,14,8,1,2,3,36,32,21,0,0,5,1,1,1,0,1,5,0,1,0,13,16,0,4,4,1,3,4,4,3,0,3,2,1,27,8,37,27,5,40,0,2,0,2,12,14,0,3,20,134,40,1,0.11895945138689833,0.0,0.0,0.3890500832587061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951318302952366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12473935704480398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13279809000043674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10247303398012768,0.0,0.12855290582989193,0.0,0.0,0.13162637031467586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13381337130584134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13031426430230084,0.0,0.1011868485792318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18645421043809168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15947202541404593,0.12568719171735454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10573662624930176,0.0,0.12387796264587125,0.19613101027145632,0.09696783018679583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08402457856350043,0.05811757907365012,0.0,0.0,0.10527537104177988,0.0,0.0,0.1298582936901887,0.0,0.10736554936374804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848568974729647,0.2528701412230019,0.0,0.0,0.09174886252713056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806100029545624,0.09047402329791744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13058175477001505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2708037984331646,0.07620847068929007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687806392111478,0.0,0.0984044874802936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679494711978107,0.1900023430875296,0.0994554280110736,0.1362676496416603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944270275655594,0.0,0.1039758038622142,0.10952188013071217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06936621275026725,0.1367263897270027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384098422414205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660598645434467
addiction,sinner4206,2019/02/20,"the Loser me Hello there , am gonna Talk About my life and Problems and i hope if someone could advise me 
I am 22 old and I feel dead and old from the inside I have this addiction of being loser and lazy in life I have never took responsibility or did anything useful in my life I drop out of school cuz I basically was missing alot of classes while I was just chilling by myself, smoking weed ,jerking off and being lazy spending time watching stupid shit on the internet. 
I never had true friends in my life I mean there is some people that I call friends, we do meetup but I never had the balls to talk about my problems and be honest I have nobody to talk to .
 I am not bad with talking to people and being around them , but I get really anxious and desperate about my life and the way I look and the fact that I didn't do anything interesting in my life .
So that's why I had no girlfriend what so ever ,I had sex only couple times with a girl I meet and i was really bad  in bed so I have 0 confident after that , so she left me and because I was a lazy loser she said.
I try to escape from going out a lot and always afraid of meeting people,  because I just dont feel comfortable with what I have 
I started working after I dropped off school  and I also fucked that up by being the awkward guy there and missing on many work days ، so ..Unemployed.
I watch and read alot about being successful and happy  and healthy in life but I never stick to something I always relapse after a while, for example I tried to loss weight since I was 15 years old and I never committed to it till now .
I just imagine myself being perfect in the future but this future never came ,my life is just useless no goals nothing. 
I get depressed and lonely and start blaming myself on everything, so everytime when I feel like that I end up smoking weed ,eating like a pig and jerking off. 
And what piss me off the most is that I know it's not complicated to loss weight or be more active and have some goals but I never DO .
I am actually good at many things and I have a good body structure under my fat and some beauty signs 🤣

I really would like to believe there’s a higher power. In the programs here that’s part of it you have to believe in a higher power in order to stay sober. I stopped going to meeting I’ve been sober almost three years but I am isolated I feel like I don’t fit in with the people in the meetings and it’s very hard for me to believe there’s something greater looking out for just me....does anyone else have this problem?

addiction,TrueBench,2019/02/20,"Man and Dog I am writing because recently a friend of mine lost her son to the disease of addiction.  He suffered an overdose and with no one close by at the time with Narcan or EVZIO he died.  Narcan and EVZIO are trademark names for Naloxone which is a medication used to block the effects of opioids and hopefully extend life until medical personnel can arrive.
                The Surgeon General recommends all Americans, at this time, get access to Naloxone and carry it with them.
                My friend told me her son was especially keen on an organization by the name of ‘K9s for Warriors’.
                “K9s For Warriors is dedicated to providing service canines to our Warriors suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, and/or Military Sexual Trauma as a result of military service post-9/11.”
                During these trying times I encourage all my fellow Americans to keep our military in mind. We need also to keep in mind all those who they stand to protect.  At this time the scourge of opioid addiction is sweeping the nation and killing many Americans – young and old alike.  Warriors, good and proud, who have suffered grievous injury in the defense of our nation have succumbed in numbers that chill the soul.
                Times are tough right now.  It is important to realize that something can always be done no matter how small.  Don’t you think?

addiction,wormwood0010,2019/02/20,"Going back to Florida to get clean.... I leave later today at 130pm from LA to Jacksonville, FL. I want a life. I deserve to live happy. Its the same story once again. I tend to change locations when I want to get clean. My motives are pure this time and Im not running. I just got out of a relationship that will take some time to heal. And I know I have a better chance to recover

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as the plane touches down Im going to detox. A close friend of mine who will have a year clean in March is letting me stay with him. He is actively working a program and has a huge network of sober friends, alot of the same friends I know and know me.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on and on about all the horrible episodes of the addict that has happened the last couple years while in California but they arent any different than the next person. I wan to concentrate on the other side. Once I cross that threshold and stop using, I am sober. And my sober life and the life before cant mix. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im on a small taper only because I have a long flight. There is a 14 hr layover in Chicago where is stupid cold. Please keep me in your prayers I will update as I move along. I can do this but only with your help.

addiction,TheHungHorse,2019/02/21,"Quitting Weed Cold Turkey: Is it a good idea? I am on my third day without smoking, and MAN is it tough. I have gotten tempted MANY times within the last 24 hours, but didn't succumb. Thank you God! That doesn't mean that staying away is hard, though.

And let me just get one thing straight: It's not finding something to do that makes it hard, it's the PHYSICAL WITHDRAWAL that makes the entire process tough. It's nearly impossible to concentrate on a simple college assignment. The temptations always come on around 9-10 pm. I want to stop smoking completely, but I have been smoking every single day for about 4 years now. I have no more bud to my name except for a thc oil cartridge with maybe 10 hits left in it. I do NOT plan on buying anymore. I have the money, but DO NOT want to submit. I want to stay committed to quitting. But the temptation to finish it off is killing me. 

Because of this immense withdrawal, I've been contemplating gradually weaning off the pot, instead of trying to quit cold turkey. For example, I could take a couple hits from the pen twice a week, only before bed, and work onwards from that? Or would it just be easier to continue quitting cold turkey? Some have said that weaning off of it can make the withdrawal worse. Is that true? 

Any help is appreciated, thanks a ton!",4.210418326693231,6.01696744223108,4.865456175298807,82.53260657370521,71.78884462151395,7.729163346613546,28.48625498007968,8.395991825355821,2.086467569721115,1032,40,193,17,20,331,151,251,0.092,0.7609999999999999,0.147,0.9114,0,0,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,0,6,7,7,1,0,15,0,24,0,0,3,2,34,40,9,1,5,12,0,2,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,19,6,0,1,3,0,2,1,7,3,0,3,5,7,14,4,34,29,4,28,0,0,0,0,6,14,0,2,11,130,33,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09996549144006384,0.0,0.0,0.08169881897365194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11914586707125553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069494155739644,0.0,0.0,0.1128747928600515,0.0,0.0,0.07323577997560553,0.0,0.10222966461714207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348933770203073,0.12596373210054349,0.0,0.0,0.09592142613411488,0.13293181004701884,0.0,0.15495977224952848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122251111568008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098051103902049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06276780664636511,0.0,0.0,0.10076711430779538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2152423647921932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08052681593921349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11831297439769413,0.0,0.0,0.13562260516107655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13291629501956745,0.0,0.0,0.09792953457765843,0.0,0.0,0.13053166138381547,0.12285053667718908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24058167397468835,0.12180235664972232,0.12069603806346994,0.13086687805195585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08140947421879005,0.09137132362212806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5111315801335439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114279951262835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248907456407444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25610493984075555,0.0,0.1004418038186906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09032977468346094,0.0,0.0,0.2212161853391915,0.0,0.0,0.07981518838026297,0.0,0.11803621647017624,0.0,0.07005417071788324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156667381082147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21258375105112975,0.0,0.09636847054148014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11580996289500314,0.0,0.08746281472550348,0.0,0.122432173355009,0.08534348587120798,0.0,0.0,0.07736574681401844
addiction,Shanerdd,2019/02/21,"Gambling is ruining my life. Not sure if this really belongs here, but I didn’t really see anywhere else to put it. I need help.

I’ve lived in Nevada since I was in middle school, but I’m 26 now. Moved around a lot growing up because our living situation was never stable. My parents gambled a lot and we had to move being short on rent multiple times and other stuff involving money lost because they gambled.

I’ve never really kept a job for long because I get burnt  out and end up missing work and getting let go. I started gambling at casinos before I turned 21 and have been doing it ever since. Almost every penny I’ve made I’ve gambled over the last 6-7 years. I’ve been with my girlfriend for a while now and found out she’s pregnant and I’m trying to get my shit together. I’ve been working and keeping a job (which I usually never do.) We are getting our own place in this month. We have everything paid, but I just feel like I can’t ever save money because anything extra I have after paying bills I just go gamble. I don’t know how to stop, and it’s draining me working and never have money. Clearly the obvious thing is to quit gambling so I have money, it’s just so hard for me to do. I’m heading down the same path my parents did and are still on and I wanna change it. I just don’t know where to start.  It makes me feel depressed because I’m working for nothing in a sense. 

Sorry for the all over the place story, and sorry if this is the wrong forum for it.

addiction,Faith_tx,2019/02/21,"Is it unreasonable for me to mention to my daughter's counselor? My daughter is living at home and 19. She has anxiety and depression problems and from what I just heard she is smoking marijuana every day.  I knew that she had sometimes, and it's illegal in our state, but I wasn't terribly concerned until I realized how often.  Anyway, I'm paying $100/hr for therapy, and I really think her counselor should know. I've asked her to bring it up and she keeps ""forgetting"".  Her counselor used to be a LCDC, so she has worked with addition much in the past.  I know that weed isn't nearly as dangerous as some drugs, but considering she has no motivation and her moods are here and there, I figure it's worth mentioning.

addiction,Oldendorff11,2019/02/21,"Juul and other addictions I'm straggling with. Hello,

I am not sure if see these activities as addictions, but I am kinda tired of them and want them away. I'm struggling with juul for now, and would like to hear what you think about that as well as to give one advise in particular.

In general, my final goals for now are:

\- Quit juuling; (Now I try to do it only when I drive on Mon and Wed)  
\- Quit sugar (I am not using it for a month already)  
\- Quit porn, and masturbate once a month at most (I can handle 1 week easily now)  
\- Drink less coffee (not doing it yet, I think it would be too much for now haha. I stopped drinking red bull daily though);

My problem for now is that once I stopped using sugar, I've got much more desire to hit the juul (and eat something sweet/bad of course). 

I'm thinking, would it be a good idea to try to smoke 1 regular cigarette on other days when I want juul badly? There is much less nicotine in there. So I though like smoking 5 cigarettes a week, then 4, etc, until I am able to not to eat sugar and hit juul twice a week without any problem so I could progress further.

I am just afraid to start doing all of that all over again if I go back :(

I would appreciate you advise. Also, is there anything I could add to my list in your opinion? I started to go to the gym 3 times a week two month ago for example:)",3.407199315979484,4.075903263537906,4.962937488124645,85.44747672430174,72.32129963898917,7.708835265057952,25.409272278168345,7.85451343220497,1.2664989169675092,1032,30,221,13,19,349,149,277,0.097,0.784,0.119,0.7667,0,0,6,0,0,0,48.0,0,3,2,5,23,11,0,2,8,1,21,11,0,2,3,45,41,22,0,13,9,0,0,2,0,4,3,1,0,0,12,10,7,2,4,3,0,3,5,5,1,3,1,6,26,6,38,30,10,41,0,0,2,1,11,10,0,5,30,155,38,3,0.09586538113924427,0.0,0.0,0.2090148314069884,0.0,0.0,0.08497887619382846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10578983193087067,0.0766635106618454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06519174653867996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788890404177548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09006868127569402,0.07371456067924871,0.16008717790324736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15308141240525466,0.0,0.0,0.061825240089705476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18782315436937874,0.0,0.1961884354481703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10691524083931922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10501583917523152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196280893694277,0.10896501064001564,0.08040733339739665,0.07667230276628471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804725182760797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10822034653190968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09366996575438567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295564978487785,0.0,0.2114162566484142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20418700441143392,0.06496086327551631,0.07290994221591512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834604456954716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3058938994337904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639229703524078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07380185395975856,0.0,0.0,0.13570802037353188,0.0,0.0,0.16029550240004406,0.0,0.10021931097252604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09035198720355353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18427999607878293,0.188374500468364,0.0,0.05589987467126683,0.11018315325229848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13017260204931866,0.0,0.093646547588351,0.0,0.0,0.16559381904144327,0.0,0.0,0.1130877711646118,0.0,0.3075897049570088,0.0,0.08619449061362135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09241080645412783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.272400064996656,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,agso3000,2019/02/21,"Today I broke years of silence and told my mom It all started a couple of days ago, because my mother thought that my little brother (15) started smoking cigarettes. She asked me for advice (20,F) and how to handle it (FYI my little brother despises cigarettes, but lately he started smoking weed). Apparently he thought it would be better to admit to smoking cigarettes, so that our parents wouldn't know anything about the weed. 

So today, I was riding home with my mom and older brother (22) after work. They talked about ""the fact that"" he smokes cigarettes sometimes and I sat there silent for a while. When we got home, I told her that we should have a cup of tea. I told her that I've been addicted to weed for a couple of years and that I've experiented with hard drugs during most of my high school years. Her reaction was admirable. And now, my brother decided to tell the truth too. I am so proud of him, myself and my mother. I'm kinda scared to talk to my dad though haha, but now there's no turning back ",4.74642857142857,6.025212214285716,5.282244897959185,82.12704081632656,69.71428571428571,7.6408163265306115,28.79591836734694,7.957251820313856,1.886208163265307,798,29,149,10,14,256,111,196,0.056,0.8290000000000001,0.114,0.9415,2,0,6,0,0,0,29.0,3,0,1,3,14,8,1,1,7,1,9,3,0,1,3,27,24,16,0,3,2,10,1,0,0,3,2,0,2,0,9,11,1,0,5,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,10,1,26,5,21,10,2,22,0,1,0,0,30,3,0,2,18,97,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13537750689310354,0.0,0.12134992753532793,0.1100804983096866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219180659146132,0.0,0.1160940900859054,0.0,0.0,0.0954888548272028,0.0,0.07570064021952065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10982953400224628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2748116598048379,0.0,0.08008758813975766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.144012542598576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147453975491818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09932027432102876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11124333503760102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13120587344876425,0.2491308089481365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682475813205761,0.0,0.14008352963210546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489274409521036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908826274330965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13789022678447047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12432857762358475,0.12567955361203206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228198963427285,0.0,0.26369152858527234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996267505033414,0.10854118050435782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220089027365942,0.19717443420012504,0.0,0.0,0.2354214174405309,0.3559857637281135,0.0,0.0,0.13507515140257206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040650720627744,0.0,0.0,0.08821584915417079,0.0,0.0,0.2399088218968932

addiction,LibraChick1004,2019/02/21,"Story--my twin brother is a heroin addict and my mom is suicidal--please help I'm a 20 yo female college student and for the past three years my twin brother has been dealing with a really severe drug addiction. Starting from his early teens, he was a typical ""trouble maker"" who often got into all sorts of mischief. He also smoked marijuana and drank alcohol in high school and ditched school A LOT which lead him to go onto probation and was in and out of juvenile hall for most of his high school years (which he never finished).  My mom was a working single mother who practically raised us by herself. Growing up, my brother and I always had a great relationship with my mother. She was caring, supportive, and taught us everything she knows about life. However, as we got older my brother started to drift further and further away from us. Part of this I think has to do with the fact that we didn't have a father figure growing up and my brother really needed a male role model to look up to (although I know there are plenty of people without fathers who aren't trouble makers and don't become drug addicts--including myself). His heroin addiction began right before I started college and since then he's had several near-fatal overdoses which have completely traumatized my mother and I. A few of those times I was even the one to perform CPR on him. We've done everything to try to get him to go into treatment but he refuses every time. And for the past year he's been in and out of jail for stealing cars and doing drugs in public. My mom and I have been regularly attending therapy and support groups to help us deal with my brother's drug addiction. But this month, none of that seemed like it was enough. Earlier this month, my brother got out of jail and my mom let him back in the house (which she said she wasn't going to do but she did anyways and I was against it) and two weeks in, my boyfriend was over and he found needles and a candle in our bathroom. (btw my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years so he's like family and he knows everything that's been going on) So he decides to confront my brother about it and my brother gets very angry and then he punches my boyfriend in the face and they get into it. My mom and I witnessed everything, however, when the police were called over to our house my mom lies to the officers and tells them that my boyfriend was the one who started it. I was so upset by this. After the officers left I confront my mother about it and she says that my boyfriend had no right to confront by brother and that he should've just shut the fuck up. So of course I defend my boyfriend and I tell her that my brother shouldn't have been doing drugs in the bathroom in the first place and she got so angry at me. She started making up excuses for my brother saying that ""he's got mental health issues"" and ""you should never confront someone who's got mental health issues"". And when I started saying that he's had all of the chances to go get help for himself she just continues to make more excuses for him. At this point she starts yelling at me to get the fuck out and never come back. She also starts accusing me of not wanting to help my brother and accusing me of abandoning him. At this point my boyfriend and I start leaving to go over to his house and then as we're leaving my mom tells my boyfriend that he's never allowed back at our house and that she doesn't like our relationship. I was so hurt that she said those things to me after all I've tried to do to be there for her and try to help my brother. She called me when I was at my boyfriend's house and told me that I was allowed to come back. So I went back to the house the next day but I avoided her. I was still so upset and kind of in shock about the things she said. That same day that I wentback to the house my brother stole another car and got into an accident and then fled the scene. The next day the police found him and now he's back in jail. I ended up not doing as well as I'd hoped on my midterm exams the following days and I was stressed out to the max. Fast forward to yesterday, I got home from school and my mom starts telling me that she wants to kill herself and she was planning to go to a hotel to hang herself. I didn't know what to say. A few minutes later she says she's sorry but then later I overheard her talking on the phone with my brother and she said ""I might not be here when you get out of jail"" and then she said something like ""If one more thing goes wrong then I'm going to go hang myself and I'm serious about that"". Now I'm really worried and scared. I don't know what to do. I'm all by myself in this situation. I don't have any family members who I'm close to. and I don't have any other siblings. Please help.",4.44095556617296,5.228619687370604,5.108691511387164,84.90581796464406,70.0351966873706,7.973600891861763,28.836693741041568,8.089152775773815,1.8075821500238891,3782,135,767,49,65,1220,331,966,0.113,0.833,0.054000000000000006,-0.996,4,1,8,0,1,1,77.0,10,2,2,5,37,31,7,5,39,0,63,17,1,7,9,130,137,87,1,7,12,30,0,4,0,3,13,11,1,1,48,75,2,3,11,1,0,24,20,20,1,6,53,12,132,11,131,78,15,145,0,2,1,2,142,58,2,9,69,543,180,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16942824473377371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041523566689533435,0.038907096703889206,0.0,0.0,0.062143743384763125,0.032329996304003315,0.0,0.0,0.052844686249419515,0.040742255090201865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03650501371434335,0.17925993877756158,0.0,0.0,0.04291166261699962,0.033062256100779785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07934942947485661,0.0,0.03961467842249062,0.0,0.0,0.06693929789594331,0.04073812807383356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10023156575187143,0.0801144174710735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039761569376261734,0.0,0.0,0.2252940026014721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034413490224549544,0.04014701012605184,0.0,0.02566298296710915,0.0,0.0327365310079426,0.0,0.13967941661851085,0.0,0.07325699272058156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03304955624476996,0.0,0.08520374870216495,0.0,0.0718405843986016,0.12179900849709155,0.0,0.198736799313154,0.0,0.2486034811968611,0.042837143567372254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260087919023232,0.0,0.0,0.15625982271585362,0.08210367197387877,0.038974158852066065,0.03859121355276576,0.0,0.3138295490672784,0.04159446832324352,0.0,0.0,0.08110785537795151,0.0,0.0,0.04298666734711031,0.04046090723683763,0.10676688631517912,0.0,0.0,0.0822824573266261,0.042215449244546524,0.03973128466136423,0.02744403125672068,0.07592924279682306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032627933423650474,0.0,0.0,0.03303264487505562,0.0,0.0,0.051871264229056815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07831224866930585,0.04121840754064012,0.0,0.36404668781833227,0.06202646679175713,0.0,0.0,0.028810065722688957,0.11986771937500293,0.0,0.0826442490354358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07898629705178951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04207555872519411,0.07418189517702896,0.026936767850417057,0.0,0.04059460707039153,0.08530098741899438,0.07345998583462401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07467342368316053,0.0,0.0,0.08343022869953172,0.0,0.06636293770065223,0.1847972909813754,0.15449300154276208,0.03890006021023088,0.15729102017091104,0.0,0.03537161159218242,0.0,0.08778888736868191,0.0,0.032140783998931964,0.04367400452871115,0.0,0.0,0.0329212303951895,0.029912036601250795,0.0,0.04349435060909549,0.27501363818785385,0.0,0.031029196050079526,0.0,0.04450761550942305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08818308792800347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03122971710359063,0.13584192910795784,0.0,0.04443342412662453,0.0,0.07743946560451925,0.02489634831573248,0.0,0.0,0.045312658353650274,0.0,0.0,0.03712707061588106,0.0,0.07913881755129851,0.0,0.0379551299696468,0.0,0.18694836940316095,0.0,0.0,0.03205897191253362,0.04583469613208086,0.0,0.031166678136089743,0.0,0.03493479661725892,0.03601844362599048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03745428165685634,0.0,0.028286486027117037,0.03945855723914199,0.0,0.0,0.042481217080811214,0.0,0.1000839098581667
addiction,throwaway_0556,2019/02/21,"How to set boundaries when living with an addict in denial I've gotten feedback from multiple people at this point that my [32F] boyfriend [32M] likely has a marijuana addiction. We live together, and I'm at my breaking point with it. He starts smoking in the morning and is usually still high when I get home from work, on into the evening. It's rare for me to spend time with him sober. 

He's never stolen or done anything illegal or destructive (medical marijuana is legal where we live), but I just don't want to be around him when he's high anymore. He gets mean or too silly, and I often feel like he's not really ""there"", even while I'm talking to him. It's like he's someone else. I'd rather be alone than spend time with him when he's high, and that's often what happens, because he no longer wants to go anywhere or do things that we used to do together. On the odd occasion we do go somewhere, he's stressed and anxious and cranky towards me. He's high all day even when we have his son every other weekend. Sometimes I have to lie to his son when he asks where Daddy is, because Daddy is hiding in the garage smoking pot. 

After our latest fight about his behavior, I told him that I wouldn't spend time with him when he's been smoking anymore. I don't even want to talk to him when he's high. He thinks I'm overreacting and making a problem out of nothing. He doesn't think he has a problem.

It's difficult to set this boundary since we live together. He'll smoke and then in a little while think he's sober when he's really not. What I really want is for him to stop completely, but I don't think it's realistic to ask that. I'm just not sure exactly how I can draw the line so that his moods and behavior don't affect me as much. I've thought about requiring that he come to addiction counseling with me, but I think he'd refuse. I'm ready to walk away if things don't change, but I'm not sure what to do.

addiction,ellsmirip25,2019/02/22,"Fastest way to get over a hard comedown? I'm a full time engineering student and have used adderall for the past year - not prescribed. At first it was helpful, but I started realizing that after some time the effects stopped working, and I was doing it for pleasure. In fact, it made me duller. I became more depressed and less social. My performance at school and work has declined drastically to the point where I'm scarred of failing this semester, my last one. I had this realization for a while, but couldn't bring myself to stop taking it. Everyday I would say: 1 more day of happiness. However I literally just disposed 100 pills that were given to me. I've also cut ties. I don't want to fail at everything I have worked so hard for. I don't want to damage my body and interpersonal relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

I needed to post this so I can vent. Now I need to get my head right. What are some over the counter stuff that I can use to help me? How long does an amphetamine comedown last? Any other suggestions? I can't guarantee that I will feel the same way about this when I wake up tomorrow morning (If I even manage to sleep tonight).

addiction,catifie,2019/02/22,"I'm a teen and addicted to nicotine. I know this is not hardcore like some other redditors here, but I want to stop. I am addicted to nicotine. I'm a freshman in highschool and I use a juul pod a day. I go to the bathroom ~6 times during school and take 5+ hits each time with my 50 mg nic juice. I don't know how to stop. I've tried to lower the concentration, and tried going as long as I could without using it but I can't. If I don't use it, it takes over my thoughts and makes me go almost insane for some. It's the only thing that helps me focus with schoolwork. I'm scared of consequences as I aspire to get into a good college. I have very strict parents that would not allow this at all. They don't know. My brother provides me with everything. I'm not sure where to start to stop. 

Please don't get mad at me for this. I was a stupid teenager that laughed at others who got addicted to nicotine. I underestimated how addictive nicotine is and now I'm stuck. Where do I start?

addiction,m3ghannnn,2019/02/22,"Has anyone tapered off Imodium? My friend is taking Imodium. He’s trying to go cold turkey but really struggling. I think he was taking 40-60 tablets a day for about 4 months now. It might be less than that. 

Has anyone tapered off of it? I’m thinking it’d be easier to taper than to cold turkey but I’m not an expert and just thought I’d ask.

addiction,woozookazoo,2019/02/22,"Going to rehab for the first time in a week or two! I’m extremely nervous. I’ve been dependent on stimulants (adderall &amp; vyvanse) since I was 15, I am now 18. I was taken off of Adderall last year due to severe addiction (I would go on bad binges), and eventually put on Vyvanse in which I became dependent and addicted to. Last night I went to my psychiatrist and she told me I had to quit taking them and my parents agreed, and I got soooooooo pissed. I woke up this morning, didn’t get my Vyvanse and started to get really mad and upset because I need it in my system because it makes me feel good. It hit me all of a sudden, I don’t want to be on it anymore. I don’t want to be an addict. My whole family knows I’m an addict and I’m always called one. Then it also hit me— rehab. I’m going to be going to a psychiatric hospital that does dual diagnosis for drug addiction and mental health. It’s going to be a horrifying withdrawal. Everytime I come off of stimulants I get extreme anger, psychosis, and depression. The only thing I’m worried about is that they aren’t going to admit me because I don’t take as many pills as I used to, I’m just severely dependent on them.

addiction,ShadesofRainbow,2019/02/22,"The fact I’ve never relapsed makes me question whether I’m actually an addict I passed my 6 months sober without even noticing. I didn’t even realize I was nearly coming up on 8 months, it seems like so long ago that I was counting the days. I haven’t relapsed once, even when I’ve been in a few different situations where I had my favorite drugs around me. I’ve actually regularly been going somewhere where I know someone has a prescription of one of my old favorites, and I haven’t felt pressured or concerned that I might do it. 

I mean yes I have the rare user dream, but sometimes I have a hard time convincing myself that it really was that bad. Maybe I’m just connecting all the shitty stuff that was happening in my life at the time to the drugs, but it could have been totally separate. Maybe the drugs were my answer to the shittiness, not the cause of it.

addiction,stiffbizkityee,2019/02/22,"How deep in am I? I feel like I’ve slipped a little too far. I’m all too familiar with addiction but I’ve been clean for 3 years now from the devil that is methamphetamine. This time it’s a new demon-XANAX.

Thankfully I realized that I’m fucking up. I’ve been taking Xanax daily for 1.5 months now. Now mind you I’ve only been taking 1/8th of a xan bar per dose(1-2 times per day). I know this is an incredibly low dose but I definitely feel it. 

I’m just scared because I’ve came along way. Meth ruined my life for 5 years. Now I’ve got an amazing job and I know I can’t go on with taking Xanax OR just the drug lifestyle all together. Thankfully I’ve accrued near 3 weeks personal time off from work so if I need take off for a withdrawal period I can.

Basically the advice I’m seeking is; How should I go about stopping the Xanax? How long do you think I’ll feel like shit after stopping?

Thanks in advance everybody.",0.9265848214285696,3.165649619791669,2.8486309523809545,90.92375000000004,84.05208333333334,6.365476190476191,21.12202380952381,7.62386473244151,0.8266023809523806,725,23,158,13,21,242,115,192,0.129,0.72,0.151,0.5188,1,0,3,0,0,0,22.0,0,2,0,2,13,12,2,1,10,0,11,10,1,3,2,28,34,9,0,3,6,0,3,2,0,1,7,0,1,1,6,5,1,2,7,1,0,4,1,6,0,0,5,3,13,6,19,28,2,34,1,2,0,1,3,11,2,2,20,78,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525235924884209,0.0,0.13671936587303665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528841950880188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16002085971749172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09023099137476556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622522889114124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122295479744392,0.19990482829162412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12934542332253862,0.0,0.0,0.15902923985324915,0.0,0.1118995717533817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1388400341372549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15378280366589012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09882324511398644,0.13670685079095854,0.14022753275011834,0.0,0.12381679235755125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14127018033284247,0.0,0.11167558938367124,0.0,0.0,0.10374220026316766,0.0,0.13512687209590574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064085858408873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12216484921345727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1400752735319479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14361658464437144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2339436462112571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4207825038474232,0.0,0.0,0.38643362896449773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08964929055188678,0.0,0.0,0.24474960883265925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11105480369152178,0.11222812873299252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018568415085372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18019613560703934
addiction,justjen18,2019/02/22,"Will it get any better? My boyfriend (39m) is an alcoholic. It was alcohol and cocaine but he hit the cocaine habit pretty easy, the alcohol is the issue. Weve known each other nearly 10 years and have been in a serious relationship for the past 3 years. I knew his issues going in. In the past 12 months, his commitment to his recovery has been his priority. Detox in Feb '18 with immediate relapse followed by a stint in hospital after trying to go alone cold turkey. Since then we've had periods of sobriety which have been great though he still struggles with mental health. When he drinks it is so obvious he has done. Countless relapses over 12 months means I know the signs. What I can't stand is the lying about it. Sometimes I come home and he admits to having drank. I don't chastise him. I talk to him about about why he's done it and what we can do moving forward. Sometimes I come home and he can barely stand but he swears blind he hasn't drank. I can't stand his drunken personality and the lying makes it worse. I'm so hurt. I came home yesterday and the same thing has happened again. Will this always be a feature of life? I can cope with relapse if he is honest but I can't reconcile lying it is chipping away at me. He is about to embark on a 12 week programme of support with regular drug/alcohol testing. I'm scared he is going to relapse like he did last time he did it. How do partners of addicts experience compare to mine? Is this normal? I have nobody in my life I can discuss this with. I give family and friends the impression that he's pretty much fixed because of how awful the past couple of years have been. I need to hear from people with some experience please.

addiction,evolutionarycum,2019/02/22,"Why do I lie when I’m high? I’ve been battling sobriety for months, and in general I feel like I’m getting a bit better because I no longer relapse on oxy or heroin, but rather Kratom and alcohol and benzos and adderall. And all of those except Kratom still send me spiraling downwards, but idk my husband is less infuriated with me. But to my problem. I’ve been buying CBD Juul pods that are 1000mg, and they get me high as fuck. Feels like a THC high. I was high on it last night and came home and my husband knew but I denied denied denied. This has nearly almost happened when he knows I’m high, Ive probably admitted to it less than the fingers I have on my hand. I can admit if afterwards, but rarely when I’m high. Last night he made me promise up and down and there i was,  thinking how high I felt but I couldn’t tell him because there was a chance he would take away my drugs and I couldn’t risk that. That’s always my fear - I could handle his anger but not the removal of my substances. So is my lying just to do with my desperation to have the ability to stay high? Of course my addiction harms my marriage, but the lying is what makes things worse. I’m just wondering if anyone else feels the need to lie about being high. Sorry for the ramble.

addiction,Mischa92,2019/02/22,"I feel like this might possibly be bad. maybe I'm just in a bad mood but eh.

I was a user of multiple substances for pretty much my entire life (literally, starting in elementary school) and spent about 8 years pretty much continually high on heroin, like the start-getting-sick-7-hours-after-a-shot,  hustle-score-hustle-score-repeat type. I've been through a fair amount for my age (im nearly 27 ( addiction wise and am genuinely proud of myself for having been off h for 2 years now. not off all drugs, but not a daily or even  (always) weekly user of anything anymore, and no opiates are allowed. super proud of myself, doing damn well. most sober I've been since 5th grade.

buuuuttt..

after having been worn tf down trying to keep my shit together the last 2 years, after having broken up with my ex boyfriend, fiance, best friend, partner and equal in everything drugs - pretty much my everything for over decade - and having entered into a strange-but-nice partnership with my current best friend who is, while wonderful, a recovering addict as well as mentally ill and an emotionally exhausting person to be this close to...

I feel like I'm done. 

either people don't know about my past issues, or friends don't quite understand the depth of them, or my partner is emotionally unstable and can't quite see past his own problems - whatever the reason, everyone in my life atm, I feel, puts way too much pressure on me to have my shit together. I love my partner to death but he sees me as much stronger than I am and expects so much of me - to have my own shit together enough to be there as a live in therapist 100% of the time for him. can't do it. I think people are more taxing for me than drugs.

I think i finally just about snapped when the thought popped into my head, ""I'd rather my mood and sense of well being be dependent upon drugs than on people"". I know, I know, I shouldn't be dependent upon anyone but myself, but seriously who in this world besides psychopaths has their mood unaltered by the moods of others? there's a sense of a loss of control either way, in being an addict and in sobriety. fuck it I'd rather share my sense of self control with drugs. that's what I know, that's what I'm comfortable with. idk if I can do this shit anymore.

I know it's stupid but just needed to vent and get some feedback on this shit from people who understand. I don't even feel like my partner understands because his addiction issues were more short lived and on less hard drugs than mine, and he even at times sort of berates me for having been as ""gross"" of an addict and as deeply entrenched as I was. doesn't wanna hear about it because he doesn't wanna think of me that way. like, tough shit man, that's who I was and still part of who I am. idk. I feel like the end of the rope has juuust about been reached.",7.080961887477312,6.374799455535393,7.110744101633397,77.92313974591654,64.42649727767696,10.213430127041743,31.704174228675136,9.494082108488547,2.644068602540835,2224,70,433,36,29,714,254,551,0.149,0.682,0.16899999999999998,0.953,2,0,6,0,0,0,83.0,0,0,2,10,23,43,9,1,21,0,47,24,7,6,1,77,79,35,1,9,19,1,6,6,7,2,15,1,0,7,21,22,0,3,19,0,3,2,11,18,3,0,14,9,51,21,84,56,22,55,0,1,2,2,27,29,8,11,27,292,72,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119100060193101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04761449005214558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135005614576496,0.04001196303481677,0.0,0.047090019221931234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555837217348158,0.06976576150181461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010494958096415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12836191804403593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05855945146796316,0.0,0.0,0.3981661715568167,0.0,0.0,0.12873734641012238,0.050682987172303635,0.059127115150136265,0.0,0.11338663658100945,0.0,0.0,0.05467945365296181,0.10285748458696922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14466946502327332,0.16352176126578774,0.0,0.06268548659207578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13263207424323747,0.052902152524588665,0.029896888037110818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05126096660737643,0.0,0.058727763210567524,0.0,0.0644949810328002,0.0,0.0,0.06045971109438075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061811139851752524,0.11945281826605494,0.0,0.050862826894115414,0.0,0.0,0.15724254338139732,0.04664474492935266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083722255805463,0.16773890763027732,0.0,0.1010587000771762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0516463929802752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748864153938685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05766777314422537,0.06070503186435783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25239489634258405,0.042430459157979286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06196741420942097,0.10925250583831896,0.15868612576263372,0.0499653046874179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06451083590130395,0.0,0.17465044633178525,0.0,0.05475510836812952,0.0,0.05752536712947594,0.0,0.1217283543901644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05883523168699941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057913181034699786,0.09119935333849886,0.0,0.05969653277557424,0.0,0.3524342618743344,0.04733582477384343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08100609735039452,0.0,0.045698716843640366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644082977540804,0.0,0.10999941831735456,0.0,0.04542902315875642,0.06673490154865845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0388509626952671,0.0,0.0,0.17871487202943576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13626392057553546,0.045901195660994,0.0,0.1543522470926077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062056384771701174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055006669761264
addiction,iLOVEhentaiAND420,2019/02/22,"Friend went from smoking a cig a day, to a couple, to now a pack, and only escalating. Any advice? Normally i don't care about a dudes health or choices. If it hurts nobody but yourself, knock yourself out, your life your choices. But being roommates and seeing his health slowly fail (18, coughing huge fits, getting aggressive when brought up suggestions of laying off/calming down, wasting all his money instead of essential shit, etc.) and its breaking my heart. I'm his roommate, I don't smoke, but i wake up to that burning smoke smell every day inside his room even tho it's a no smoking plaza. Anything i mention to do with ciggs, he gets extremely defensive and protects those cancer sticks with his life, enough to say harmful things to me and not give a fuck/not apoligize. Is there any way i can assist him without him potentially fighting me? I don't consider ciggs to be an issue, but when it controls your life, and you defend it AND get pissy? I gotta cut you off. But since he's my best friend and is tossing this friendship into the trash, it's like i can't do anything but abandon him and break off our friendship? Is that the onlu choice i have? I'll do it, but it'll hurt my heart.

addiction,yet_Another_Addict,2019/02/23,"Going into rehab this week. Don't know what to expect. Nervous yet hopeful Hi guys,  


I'm and addict and my cocaine use is destroying my life(and body!) and the life of my partner. I've tried therapy, I've tried abstinence(managed a few days max), tried cutting down but I'm just too prone to addiction. In the last 2 years my cocaine use has escalated from a casual recreational line here and there(a couple every few weeks maybe) to all day, every day ( damn the dark web has some fucking good coke and the switch to purer coke for cheaper peices at my finger tips next day delivery was what pushed me to crave more and more).

On average a 10-20mg line every 45minutes to an hour with the rare binge. At home, at work, everywhere. I've managed to keep it hidden from everyone and have just about managed to keep my job.  


Yesterday was the first day I admitted to anyone except my therapist about the extent of my dependancy or even regular use. My girlfriend is devastated. I've lived with her for 2.5 years and for the majority of that I have lied, deflected, gaslighted, argued like crazy and have been a total shitbag in order to keep her from finding out. The small silver lining in this is for her is that a lot of confusion has now been quashed, she has answers to so many questions she's been asking herself about changes in my behaviour and the choices I make.   


Having told someone, especially her, is a huge relief and I know I need help and to have even the remotest availability of cocaine removed from me. So I'm going into a residential rehab program for 28 days or so, hopefully in the next couple of days.  


Is there anything specific I need to do to prepare? What should I expect from the initial detox process? What's it like in there?

addiction,theyhird,2019/02/23,"Is there a early drug intervening program somewhere in Europe? Hi, 
A close family member is in the early stages of addiction. Could one of you refer me to some kind of early drug prevention program, something aimed for young people, maybe something outdoorsy.  Anywhere in Europe.

addiction,TheFreezingRussian,2019/02/23,"Please help Hi! I am 16 years old and from day to day I am getting lower as a person and more addicted to everything. A year ago, I used to be a good student who could show example to others as  I aced nearly every test and learnt pretty good. I even could manage to do a C1 language exam in 9th grade from a foreign language which I consider my biggest achievement so far. It's pretty rare to do that, at least among my peers. But since then I have started to slide down. When I passed the exam it all started like a brief relaxation from the toil of preparation but now I  am sitting here drunk exactly one year after the exam and I became a really a bad person. I can't control myself at all. It started with lot of internet use, and it is still my main problem that I can spend my whole day surfing the Internet and Youtube and all the other social media bullshit, even though I fully recognize the path I have chosen and where it leads down. I just can't keep my responsibilities and slowly but surely, from day to day I am becoming a shittier person. I can't match my goals, I am more rude to others. It's addiction to music and Internet now, but today is the first time I smoked cigarettes, even though I had  firm promises that I won't smoke  ever but I just can't control myself. I feel that with some time I can slip into harder drugs, because I can access them very easily and have thought a lot about picking them up. Like marihuana, lsd, cocaine. I need help. I can't control myself. I am at the very beginning but I can see where I am going. I can't even force myself to do my homework. I am really scared, especially because I now have a crush and want to talk to her soon and perhaps start a relationship and don't want to be a disappointment for her that I am an unambitious guy who can't even control himself and becoming a slave to addiction. I want some advice. I am nearly crying right now. I am desperate. I don't know what the fuck has happened to me. Sorry for the rant, but I am really stressed right now. To sum up, I have Internet addiction (all social media, games, music) but lately started drinking and today I smoked my first cigarette. I regret my whole fucking life. HELP!  
TL;DR: Addicted to the Internet, slipped into alcohol and cigarrete use. Fearing I will get to harder durgs. Can't achieve my goals, becoming a rude and arrogant to others.  Need advice.

addiction,baldnotes,2019/02/23,"Another attempt. Another attempt at this. I'm so weak, I don't know if I have the power to do this. I still have substance here. I should throw it away. I'm telling myself, go to sleep, throw it away first thing in the morning. It feels so easy being optimistic right before your brain goes to sleep.

I'm not a person who likes to self-pity. But I'm kinda realizing right now that I do need to pity myself a little bit. I feel utterly alone, no one even knows about this issue I have that I'm fighting with day in and out. I'm not even sure what to do. I feel like, fighting this alone is not helping.

I went to meetings, but I can't stick to them, this thing is consuming me. I need to stop. I want to stop, too. But I feel so powerless.

addiction,braapbraap69,2019/02/23,"Fail your way to success I am one of the biggest failures ever!
  
I tried to quit drinking and drugs so many times I can't even remember, but 30 to 60 days later I'd always drink/use again. Failure after failure, pathetic. 
  
    
I admitted I'm a failure and went to treatment, the same day I left I got drunk! What a pathetic failure that was. 
A couple years later and much closer to death, I could not stop so I tried treatment again, I lasted 2 days after being released and drank and drugged again. A double whammy of a failure. 
  
I tried that AA crap with those hand holding God chanting weirdos and I failed at that too.  
I failed at AA multiple times, over ten 30 day chips. 
  
So after ten years of trying and failing to get sober, I reached that point where I couldn't go on. 
I couldn't get back up again because I already knew I'd be beaten back down by life, drugs, and alcohol. 
I'd been down like that a million times before.  
This time I was beat down for good.  
The final failure, I couldn't go on, too painful. 
  
 
I stood at a turning point, either kill myself or completely give myself to the AA program.  
 
I became willing to believe.  
I became willing to do whatever it took.  
I honestly set out to do the AA program, steps 1 to 12. 
  
 
And I haven't had a drink or unprescribed drug in over a decade.  
 
By failing so much I succeeded. 
 
I kept getting back up and trying a different way. 
 
Failure is the path to success. 
 
The master has failed more times than the student has even tried. 
That's totally true for the guys I sponsor in AA.
  
My 2 best friend gave up on recovery and they are dead from overdoses. 
I know so many other people who gave up and died. 
I relapsed for years, but I always tried again the next day.    
  
I never gave up, even though i easily could have and had a great excuse. 
 
It is always darkest before the dawn, it sounds cliché I know, but it's true. 
   
I'm not here pushing AA or recruiting, it's just part of my story. If you hate AA, I get it, so did I.  
  
I hope this gives someone some HOPE to stay sober another day, come back to recovery, or start your journey into a better life.    
  
Peace

addiction,scuba_kels,2019/02/23,"How do you know when it’s time to label yourself an addict? I’m in a really unexpected place in life where I’ve always been in control, waited until I was older to sample any recreational drugs (27), and have never had an addiction. I’m ready to settle down, get out of the party scene, change my friend group, etc. I even broke up with my SO due to his party habits. I know what I want, to stop doing this stuff, and the more I know it, the more I find myself binging on coke, which I never did before. As if I know it’s my last opportunity to have this type of drug related fun. I don’t partake 
often, I don’t have a stash, I don’t even buy it or like how anxious and bad it makes me feel. And yet, I find myself wondering if I’m addicted because I know I don’t like it or want to do, but if it’s offered, I can’t say no. It’s been one year of drug use, not that frequently but I still feel out of control. Can I label myself this way? Should I? Will that help me stop? I’m glad I feel so bad about it so I know it has to stop, but I feel like step one is saying out loud I may be addicted. 

Just confused and maybe dramatic?

addiction,bubachinsky,2019/02/23,"Addict I can't do it. I've tried so hard. So. God. Damn. Hard to stop drinking and smoking weed and taking any drugs under the big yellow sun. It's such a vicsious cycle. I go sober for a day, a week, two weeks, then I feel like complete and utter garbage and right back I go. I've read all the tips, I've read all the examples, I've read all the stories, nothing seems to work and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm beginning to think I'm just a lost cause. At what point do I stop and say, ""okay, enough is enough, time to make things right and go clean so I can become something other than a scumbag who lives from one high to the next."" I've been waiting for that moment almost every day for years and it still hasn't come. I hate who I've been, I hate who I've become, and I hate that it's within my own ability to change it but I'm too good damn unwilling to act upon it.

addiction,Sixtrav,2019/02/24,"I really need advice. Hi, I really want to talk to someone. I have been addicted to drugs since I was 16 ( I am close to 30 now). I don’t know how to stop, I don’t know what to do. Every day I come home from work and get so trashed that it physically hurts to come to work the next day. I thought I could overcome this myself, and committed to being sober for a week in January. After that week I doubled down so hard I should have died, but I think my tolerance prevented that. I know I could be so much more in life but when I wake up to face my first day, I always make the wrong choice every time. I don’t know what to do, I really want help. Last week I considered killing my self, which is what made me reach out. I can now see I can’t do it alone, but I don’t know how to find help.",2.194282945736436,2.68026048255814,3.9267441860465127,92.43899224806204,74.98837209302326,8.058914728682172,21.891472868217047,8.344100000000001,0.7370565891472869,601,13,152,10,12,203,96,172,0.121,0.772,0.107,-0.6555,0,1,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,3,8,3,1,0,3,0,20,5,2,4,1,30,36,11,2,6,3,0,1,0,0,1,3,0,1,1,10,6,0,2,8,0,0,2,5,3,0,1,4,2,28,0,20,27,3,23,0,1,1,0,5,6,0,0,15,98,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245999117659794,0.0,0.1276985372438136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13534459592740844,0.0,0.0,0.10873584851085108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22513771071896874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20867396360107854,0.0,0.0,0.252832483658172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356247342630066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15154678217048556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22020630271520625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11943873507854755,0.1111559527378346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682746677532183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11706320268126676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17518348647897994,0.0,0.13108223684675582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13989515383661075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14457755283018536,0.0,0.3590902970472974,0.10652126932181287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230282605656608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236521435301728,0.08722960986819903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09606450047581154,0.09689722549154947,0.0,0.0,0.13897917678229746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25114998495664265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10413467683936407,0.0,0.13632726376779486,0.0,0.0,0.10809946858840493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11072435293161133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10925394960654024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10503526681790176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373417471123112,0.0,0.10374496030045982,0.07620029257096389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15415636080792566,0.0,0.3144697413998159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19027252775578224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14287756613457095,0.0,0.0
addiction,slackjawedrube,2019/02/24,"Cocaine and booze So I just wrote out a giant essay but re read it and it was incoherent rambling mess. Basically I’ve been spiralling in excessive use of drugs and alcohol, and I’m not sure I can stop myself. Have been to the point of contemplating suicide but have a gorgeous 10 month old baby that drags me back to reality. I’m not sure what I’m after here, maybe just some advice but I’m just taking a stab in anonymity because I don’t know what to do.

addiction,sleeplesswaste,2019/02/24,"He's addicted to opiates. I'm addicted to him. It's probably ridiculously cliche, but the deeper he sank into opiates, the more completely dependent he became, the more codependent I became.  From supportive, to ATM, to covering for him, to making excuses, to giving space, yadda yadda. All of that started from a need to keep things quiet (unsupportive family), but it's totally my fault I went this far.  I can own that.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now he's moving between fent and subs... again.  It's been an ugly few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also become ridiculously controlling about the stupid shit.  I am sure there's some deeply seeded psychological reason, like trying to reign in the things I can, but honestly the reason isn't as important as the stating the fact that I am controlling.

&amp;#x200B;

Case in point.  I've been struggling with something this last week, probably since Valentines Day.  And it gripes me so much I'm a little nervy and angry even when He and I haven't spoken.  I want to say ""Don't tell me you love me.  It sounds hollow and feels insincere"".  

&amp;#x200B;

While I get we can't control other people, if I could remove that from his vocabulary I would.   I'm not a complete asshole, I get that there are still feelings there, but I accept that while he works his way through this (stumble, back up, fall completely, back up, weeks of backslide... the whole gambit) one notion seems to hold true - which is -  I am not more important than his addiction.  I am not required more.  I am not needed more.  I am not wanted more.  I hate it, but I get it.  And while in the midst of this battle, it either feels like a lie when he says it, or it feels forced, like what he thinks  he's supposed to be feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to say this without starting a fight - hurt feelings - or slippage -- or is this yet another in the laundry list of things I have to ride out whilst this mountain is climbed?

addiction,alielantha,2019/02/24,"roommate relapsed so my roommate admitted he’s started using again and has been stealing from me. I found my credit card in his room, got pissed and locked him out. he agreed to come get his shit by the end of the week.

at first i wasn’t going to let him back in but it’s kinda chilly and he was just sitting on the porch. I’m gonna let him keep his cats here until he finds a new arrangement. I want him to be okay but I can’t trust him after he stole from me. I would’ve been willing to work with him about the late rent if he would’ve just talked to me

i guess i don’t know how to handle this, kinda worried he’ll take more shit before he leaves. Mostly just want him to be ok but I don’t feel comfortable living with him anymore

addiction,mushroomcloud379,2019/02/24,"Need help/advice urgently     My stepbrother(39 M) has been in an alcohol abusive, depressed, suicidal, and chaotic downward spiral for the last several years. While the situation has been beyond serious for a long time, it has escalated quickly in the last couple months. He’s lost several great jobs, his home and his wife, his income and medical insurance. 
    He’s been in several different treatment programs- inpatient and out, medicated, etc. It gets worse. In the last month, he’s been arrested twice for OVI(his 3rd and 4th offense in 3 years), spent 2 weeks in county jail, skipping all of his court dates afterward, been hospitalized 2 times with BAL’s of over .45, found unresponsive and barely breathing, and found another time face down in a flooded ditch on the side of the road after being hit by a car. He told the ER nurse that he doesn’t want to live anymore. 
    He has no insurance, and no desire to help himself at this point. He’s destroying his parents’ lives as well as his own. He was my best friend in high school, and he’s one of the most gifted individuals on the planet in a million aspects of life. He can’t figure this one out, and I can’t either. So...how do we get him help?",7.701976401179942,7.240309654867258,7.940840707964599,71.67491887905604,63.07079646017697,11.781120943952804,36.53244837758112,11.20814326018867,4.121234218289087,946,40,173,24,12,310,143,226,0.14300000000000002,0.763,0.094,-0.9001,4,0,1,0,0,1,39.0,1,0,0,2,3,9,2,0,14,0,15,6,2,0,1,23,25,13,1,3,1,2,0,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,5,14,1,0,3,0,1,1,5,5,2,4,11,0,12,4,32,12,6,40,0,2,0,0,25,22,0,1,17,103,17,3,0.0,0.13964909700617195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11517494928573878,0.0,0.12596034758288532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12359026503775672,0.0,0.0,0.11688902382530585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12369058031792045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041383552510735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10151574902929553,0.0,0.0,0.12314237971917882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13144907379338042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2584627154534566,0.0910611277284429,0.0,0.1231577364267504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12994503900755344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370044670017497,0.12452936831011388,0.11822680437020977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11696143986974306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2882237038134908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325054882733503,0.0,0.0,0.20815144258970275,0.10430558018932592,0.0,0.0,0.12866204632397374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2374703613907284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18815520773646255,0.0,0.0,0.08739436858708935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15973485619731614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13087358352378833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114192022369724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11928425922879934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39945697040740624,0.0,0.0,0.13248362868018304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892365224536387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20618164518977836,0.0,0.0,0.11262372412458226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06951900711371316,0.0,0.0945430733438252,0.0,0.10597353444005854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12011308138551632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15180059275070054
addiction,sunnyclarity,2019/02/24,"Scared to seek help because of my job I’ve been a coke addict for 3 years now. I was introduced to it by an ex boyfriend. We would do it together and eventually I ended up using on my own. He was abusive, so I turned to coke to cope. At my peak I was using a gram a day. I’ve moved on from that relationship, but never dropped the habit. I currently use 0.5 grams about 2x a week. My current bf doesn’t know about it. He just thinks I have problem binge drinking 2x a week. I’d like to seek support from a counselor or therapist (one on one, no NA), but I’m scared to because I am a RN. I’m also currently in school to be a nurse practitioner. I don’t want to lose my RN license or spot in my professional program.

addiction,usernamehihello,2019/02/24,"How do you know when it's addiction? I'm looking for advice here and would be really appreciative of any help or insight. Thanks.

I know that I have a problem. But I can't help but think it's ""not that bad."" It seems almost over dramatic for me to go to a meeting or seek help for it.

I do feel powerless over my drug and alcohol use.

Last weekend I took cocaine and got very drunk despite the fact I am on important medication that I'm not supposed to drink on - never mind take cocaine.

It gave me a scare as my chest hurt a bit afterwards, and I found out a few days later I've suddenly got high blood pressure (it used to be low and I'm pretty young and slim, eat a very vegetable dense diet, so wtf).

Next week comes and I go out and end up drinking despite having an exam the next morning. Next thing you know I'm taking more cocaine and the partying ends about 9am.

Been feeling a bit bad in the wake of it. Found some bits left on my table and took more, by myself, today.

I've also stopped my v important medication for the time being cause I'm scared combining it with coke is gonna kill me.

So far though, I only get hard drugs when I'm with people and they buy it. I don't even have a dealer or anything.

So it seems a bit ridiculous to put myself up there as if I'm I've got a real problem worthy of going to meetings, etc.

Also,for me the substance doesn't matter as much as the high or temproary relief. I use love /attention and sex in a similar way. Or drugs or alcohol. My problem is more than I'm seeking highs and destroying my life, than a particular substance or thing. I have no idea what to do with this.

And it's not making me a good person. I don't feel good about all of this. But I just want to be high / happy. It's taking over my life.",1.5903152492668615,3.2762260618279586,3.6198044965786913,89.18834310850441,78.70430107526882,6.552101661779082,23.100684261974592,7.463857097105799,0.8950956989247318,1373,44,300,19,33,467,188,372,0.171,0.715,0.114,-0.9769,1,0,10,0,0,1,42.0,0,2,1,0,14,19,3,3,21,0,20,22,3,6,3,69,62,37,1,6,15,0,4,0,0,2,10,0,0,1,20,20,9,1,14,4,1,7,9,13,0,0,9,5,31,6,40,47,12,46,0,2,1,2,11,19,0,12,19,182,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08189263502880925,0.0,0.0734070641016459,0.0,0.16056233350436333,0.07522251500412434,0.0,0.0,0.12014796952725383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05108464189115202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06181792317048152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544526859240254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3280493283305119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07716963658067595,0.0,0.06470981860540376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048446627334078035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14717934538129587,0.2613484365591495,0.07686721479465758,0.0,0.0,0.13306926006132438,0.0,0.08377942118397318,0.049616504052870825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11394982658777428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16473190775284874,0.0,0.0,0.03924745749209334,0.0,0.12807844956051428,0.1260153332321398,0.18024262292750726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799673661916995,0.06729337867637962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15105543531355475,0.3174765130358048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041824712202178,0.08480210979834447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08310990804852515,0.0,0.12385309192681625,0.06123338461086264,0.0,0.0,0.08161884420140551,0.0,0.10611992298957468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06308245588699445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06779935124342068,0.0,0.05014364065056397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15135237435705726,0.0,0.0,0.07585047748812904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055222347072437734,0.0,0.05793770342092242,0.0,0.23967510260607144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05713266611433278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05207922449757256,0.06559248472164511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07642474315803165,0.0,0.21564105121766405,0.0,0.07551703703504763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550378569674594,0.04812423447377903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1504178214630407,0.0,0.0,0.13677410082603408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06280425645606855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16944421901501028,0.0,0.0,0.06916103409171574,0.0,0.0,0.09981369050623656,0.04813430179540712,0.07380569173845816,0.0,0.04380347560787666,0.0,0.07120562587862403,0.0,0.16692369047113595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946404582081852,0.0,0.12396486502506357,0.04430812640358598,0.05962730328159745,0.06025728240694896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05336357940350739,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,mysteriousscooby,2019/02/24,"Is abstinence the only option? [adrenaline et al] Hi all, 

Hope everyone is on top today, or if not at least knowing that tomorrow will be better.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I really need the help of the public on this. I have an addictive personality (adrenaline addiction at the core) and not sure of abstinence is the only option, or if moderation is realistic for a person like me. A quick history:

&amp;#x200B;

* Stole money from my parents at 3 because my neighbour told me to. Got caught by parents with a baited fiver
* Stole a beer (500ml) when I was 5, got drunk with my 2 childhood friends 
* Started shoplifting at 8. Got caught by shop keeper. Kept doing it occasionally (chewing gum up to dvd boxsets)
* Smoked pot at 13. Still frequently (and now living in the Netherlands)
* Drinking frequently from 13 also. Didn't return home one night - got caught
* Heavy Call of Duty sessions for a number of years.
* At 16 discovered BASE jumping. Learned to skydive (700 jumps) and graduated to BASE (\~100 jumps) at 22. Was heavily obsessed for 8/9 years.
* Got involved in heavier drugs from 17. Weed, coke, E, MDMA, speed, LSD, Magic mushrooms. Always alternating, but always partying on something.
* Mixing drugs was a favourite, particularly LSD, mushrooms and pot.
* I Base jumped drunk and/or high about 75% of the time. When I had enough BASE jumping experience (and the buzz plateaued) I started mixing BASE with E, mushrooms and LSD. I only did this a few times. I also skydive the day after heavy sessions, and often while stoned.
* Driving my bike fast was my kick for a while too

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped these habits around 25 when I met my gf. Partied with drugs a few times, and smoked pot, but a lot calmer than before. I went on a bit of a binge lately, after moving to NL. Smoking pot daily. I also had a HARD session the other night. Jumped into a coke-ketamine-mdma-pot binge with my gf's old housemate. Went harder and harder until blacking out, which I has a tendency to do. Had  a good night, but coming down now (like before) and I'm feeling the pull again. The desire for adrenaline is captivating.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very confused as to the nature of my addictive personality. I use moderately, feel a draw, and get sucked in for a binge,  suffer a comedown, say 'Fuck that, I'm out', quit, and days/weeks/months later I dabble again. Pot and weed are less damaging to my psyche, but the desire to have a few beers/wines/whiskeys at night is real. Also, the pot has been an issue as I smoked A LOT for years, and used my hippy views to avoid responsibilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have my life here; have the job, the girl, the place. I'm happy and have a lot of meaning in my life, but I miss the adrenaline. The binge the other night triggered this realisation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is abstinence the only option for people who are addicted to adrenaline. Is a beer/joint or two a week in any way realistic? Do I set a moderation target, and if I fail to reach it, I quit it ALL? It's such a difficult decision. Any feedback would be great. Thank you for reading.

addiction,cohara5,2019/02/24,"quitting adderall, relapsed a little but staying strong i got adderall prescribed a few months ago, but this is the worst fucking drug i've ever taken. it helped me to function for  a while but then i built a tolerance and just kept refilling my prescription and i started losing sleep, mood swings, occasionally suicidal, feeling delirious, LOSING HAIR (i love my hair..) i didn't tell my doctor though all the side effects as in depth because i was scared i would have to crash mid-semester......it was awful. but now i'm addicted. i don't feel normal without it. i've been trying to taper for almost three months now. i'm almost there. 

&amp;#x200B;

i was totally clean for a week, and then i felt really REALLY shitty, and used adderall again. and again today. the dosage is low, though. i'm annoyed at myself, but in the scheme of things... going from adderall daily 15mg to adderall occasionally around 5-7.5 mg is progress.

addiction,jimmythebartender_,2019/02/25,"I am 10 days short of 6m clear of sex addiction and I’m on the cusp on relapsing. It’s been hard. 

Almost 6 months clear of my addiction to other women and sex but right now? I feel like it’s ramping up and really challenging me.

I’m so proud of my last 5.99 months but tonight I had a few drinks and had a message typed out to a former FWB who I know would immediately respond. She’d tell me and she’d send me whatever I wanted. 

I didn’t send it.

I have downloaded and deleted Tinder a few times. 
It’s just too easy. 

I can’t help feel like typing and opening that message was a failure. Downloading was a failure.

I didn’t do anything, and I’m clinging to my 6 month steak that is official March 6.

Thanks for listening, friends. Longtime supporter through many different account. Peace and love.

addiction,phlegminism,2019/02/25,"My entire friend group (mid 20s) is abusing cocaine and alcohol, need advice I’m in a close-knit group of friends that I met about 4 years ago. They’ve always enjoyed drinking, but over the last year it’s started to get pretty unhealthy. They drink in their car and drive drunk regularly, sometimes they will start drinking as early as 10am, and one of them recently got fired from a job when she missed work due to drinking too much the night before. I was already kind of worried about that, but about a month ago i became aware that they’ve been doing coke. I had no idea that they were even into that until a month ago, and within less than a month it’s already become a regular thing. I think they try to hide it from me because they know I don’t approve, but if I were to guess how often they’re doing it I’d say 2-3 times a week. At least twice in the last month they’ve stayed up til 7am doing line after line. And they seem to be making some bad decisions as well such as going home with strange men they met at a bar who gave them a bad vibe because he told them he had coke at home (the guy ended up being a predator). One of them even gummed an entire baggie of coke that he found on the GROUND outside a bar recently (which did not end well). I don’t know how often you can use cocaine without becoming addicted, but I’m extremely concerned with how rapidly this seems to be escalating. 

I guess I am wondering if anyone has advice for how to deal with this situation. These are my best friends and we also work closely with each other on a project that is very important to me so I can’t just ditch them. I haven’t even brought up my concerns yet because I’m afraid to - it’s 5 people against one. Would really appreciate any advice you can give. I really care about these people and don’t want to see them go down that path.

addiction,dorkingwed,2019/02/25,"Today i quit gambling. Well actually yesterday.

I had been having the odd bet on football for years, but about 4 years ago it started to become more and more. I had accounts with many online bookmakers and since the betting apps kicked in it's been like crack to me. 

Far to simple for me to top up and keep topping up, without keeping track of my bank balance.
I would loose small amounts one after another until I dare not look to see how much I had lost. 

Last year it started to feel like I knew I had a problem but I just couldn't stop.

I would sneak out of work to bet on some random game around the world with no real knowledge of any form or method. I would disappear to the toilet during meals and family time to watch results. It started affecting my mood and relationship and I was hiding it from my loved ones. Moaning about the cost of shopping, food and necessaries knowing full well I had pissed away loads.

I'm ashamed to say I would start 'borrowing' money from my kids until my next payday just so I could keep going.

I got paid on Friday and started again. Loss after loss. Yesterday I said no more and closed all of my accounts for good, no going back again.

I felt so much better tonight. 
It's only 24 hours but it's a big step for me anyway. I just feel that I needed to share.

Thanks for reading

addiction,Cl4ptr4p92,2019/02/25,"Gaming Stopped me from Becoming a Drug addict This isn't a story, tis a fact.

&amp;#x200B;

Me myself (22M) being a bit  drunk right now, I don't get drunk a lot anymore like 16-21.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe gaming was not a curse for me but an blessing.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe that I would've become a drunk and/or Drug addict if it were not for games.

The high I get from playing games feels a lot like drugs, I only smoke weed a drink every now and then but smoke every night for past 4 years prob.

&amp;#x200B;

Be it not for gaming I would've fallen FAR, people complainin' about gaming being an addiction, sure there is some, to me it IS a blessing. Yes sure, I game every night probably more than I should have, but it gives me the same high that Alcohol does, and I'd happily replace substances with gaming.

addiction,CameraClara,2019/02/25,"How to approach multiple addictions? Already quit one, life isn't improving ... I am sorry if my addictions don't seem like much, but they are really reducing my quality of life, I get overwhelmed sometimes and it leads to a very bleak outlook on life and my future.

My life revolves around four very problematic behaviors. The first is excessive gaming, the second porn, the third insane procrastination and the last one binge eating. I don't know how to face all these addictions? (if you can call the last two addictions ...) 

I started by reducing my procrastination and going cold turkey with gaming. But at the same time it feels like binge eating and porn addiction have increased in power. I taught by disciplining my self with scheduling and quitting long gaming sessions life would improve. But so far it hasn't. And it has been a whole month since quitting gaming, and at least 6 months of disciplining myself to battle procrastination.

I am lost what to do? Should I quit all behaviors at once? Will things improve.

addiction,I_dont_know_lolol,2019/02/25,"Art used to be my addiction. Now I can't get myself back into it, with the memory of what drugs feel like  I've been an artist since I was little. People tell me I'm pretty talented and can go far, if I stick to it. However..

&amp;#x200B;

Between the ages of 17-25 I smoked a lot of cannabis. This normally  wouldn't cause much harm, besides the side effects of short term memory. However it made me significantly depressed and psychotic. I was  labeled as ""bipolar"" by many doctors, whenever I was forced to be a  patient at a psych ward.  


I lost myself. It took about 3 years of  health obsession, attending addiction support meetings, and staying  clean to ""feel like myself"" again. I went to see a doctor about a month  ago and now I'm no longer ""bipolar"", rather, I have ""anxiety"". He didn't  prescribe me anything, to my surprise. And I guess, yes. I'm normal  now. However I feel like I'm slowly waking up from a coma, where my life  was a dream, and I wasn't in the drivers seat. If that makes any sense  


I'm  back to having a normal life- that is, not hiding in my parents house,  drawing every day, and experimenting with various substances- instead  attending college and pursuing a bachelors degree in psychology,  ironically. I sometimes feel proud of getting myself out of the black  hole I had put myself into, since I know a lot of people who I used to  hang out with who have yet to. I know that's a fucked up way of  thinking, but that's the mindset a lot of AA and NA meetings have, and I  want to get back to the life I had before I found the heavenly feeling  of drugs and the hell it put me into. I want to get out of an ""Addict""  way of thinking. Just because I'm not using anymore doesn't mean I'm  winning at life.   


With the  memory of drugs comes with lethargy of every day life. I get bored of  mundane shit, including drawing. That's right, I don't enjoy drawing as  much as I used to, because compared to the pure ecstasy I'd feel during a  manic episode, drawing something from my fantasy isn't as exciting and  rewarding as it used to be

And I want that  to change. I want to start drawing for fun again. I was doing it for  profit but that made my apathy and hatred even worse- because now art  was my JOB.  I want to come back from my  past, and pursue the life I had before I met insanity   


I used to spend hours a day on photoshop, drawing. It was what made life meaningful. My life feels so void without art.

I  want art to be my passion again. And that's why I'm writing this. Perhaps if I put this out there, for the masses to see, then I  can't take it back anymore. Then I have to start drawing again ",3.054850963286075,4.60650853816794,4.611210468920394,84.22395674300256,74.30534351145039,7.509560159941839,27.74336604870956,8.192908349453996,1.8699121773900402,2030,80,407,33,42,681,232,524,0.108,0.77,0.122,-0.5467,5,0,5,0,0,0,77.0,0,0,0,5,23,23,3,1,29,1,31,24,2,12,1,82,88,29,0,14,10,1,7,3,0,1,20,0,1,0,24,30,0,0,15,7,2,11,12,8,1,0,21,10,54,15,74,62,7,64,2,2,3,2,9,22,3,7,31,265,78,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20769083976378672,0.0,0.0,0.05629372180615822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880809441686753,0.07716603449687641,0.04318586227635417,0.0,0.048581471333633136,0.0,0.12596062148206694,0.0,0.0,0.05225954841650849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2441587343703989,0.0,0.11613694105227655,0.0,0.10807686750374157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06523755817629788,0.06718031225930418,0.10940858977440926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12286722378878365,0.0,0.05469712390214727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13000097358779514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2209383714861427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0419447299880666,0.0,0.10701210811182643,0.0,0.0,0.06212048503138666,0.0,0.0,0.22477173403985928,0.1361048510048534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06963041353890535,0.0,0.058709736094324665,0.16589480039441895,0.0,0.036091592818802136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06995837814641319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750329022256854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06254004503409581,0.07327672655298671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06301932881845455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06980183439931975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588460413421317,0.09307661909547654,0.06364911281312538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06932366609692582,0.16197010751069096,0.0,0.18027108745597475,0.0423903599791177,0.06438452679354749,0.0,0.06917601800230251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05068941917290887,0.0,0.09336757925518052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18666547997079652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07051525188917131,0.0,0.060623107750011576,0.08805332222563922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460784122869899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19152145773260845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05423328041475733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10121119294697296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06518739949703388,0.1050646768668947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048889573758461737,0.06280848272986378,0.0,0.08989892415554056,0.06768832646053151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07206519634515232,0.0,0.0,0.047748171368206915,0.0,0.05550653488717586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08138341588198382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0705568566253943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3290897502813285,0.0,0.0,0.2247428472141224,0.10081529054921197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058870159186827926,0.05730376256394103,0.0,0.0,0.06121695724177165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06471744687532527,0.0,0.0,0.07716603449687641,0.04089540740968362
addiction,mebegoodnowok,2019/02/25,"Venting/Advice/How Bad Am I Fucking Up? So I don’t really know why I’m posing this because I know the right answers, I’ve just got 0 willpower or determination to execute on them. 

But, I’m a coke addict. I started very very casually using for a couple years when I first joined my frat. 1-2 times a month at max. Escalated to every single frat party, probably 3-4 times a week. Then I started realizing I could use it to wake up after parties and get homework done. Then, why not every day if it got me wired and ready to do shit instead of hungover or apathetic. 

Now, I use daily. I’ve graduated and have a good full time salaried career. And I’ve probably been using blow for over a year in a row almost daily. I’ve had week, two-week breaks where it was unavailable or impractical. Other than that, if I’ve got it I do it. It costs me a shitload but I get paid very well for having almost no expenses out of college. I feel like I work better, faster, and generally get more done high so I bump in the bathroom at work. 

I just don’t know how to get out of this hole. The obvious answer is stop. I honestly feel like I could if I really wanted to; I genuinely don’t have cravings if I’m not using for two weeks or something. But then I think about how I’ll probably be tired and less effective at work and general house work and I just don’t care enough to stop. I know at some point I will have to, but I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I guess I’m a very immediate reward type of person and have trouble putting away the good short term for the better long term. 

Oh and my job randomly drug tests so this is probably a ticking time bomb. They’re infrequent and spread among the rather large employee base so it isn’t likely but could be anytime. 

Any thoughts/advice? I know I’m an idiot and a piece of shit, so feel free to point that out. 

Thanks ",1.8553931339977865,3.690534007751938,3.8762908822443727,86.96548837209305,78.43152454780362,7.110195644149133,22.94344776670357,8.052868069273773,1.1706793503137685,1459,46,313,26,35,497,195,387,0.09,0.76,0.15,0.9733,4,0,2,0,0,0,43.0,0,0,1,9,17,20,4,0,21,0,27,8,3,8,1,68,62,36,0,9,19,0,3,3,0,1,3,0,1,1,13,15,1,2,13,1,4,1,9,6,1,2,9,5,30,15,39,47,9,52,0,0,1,1,2,23,3,13,30,186,43,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08416987153337041,0.0,0.07544833736151989,0.0,0.0,0.1546285431427822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052505182472072885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254097023759606,0.0,0.06446679935367318,0.04706626165971695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13657125145373664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07872034320832805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849367730925488,0.08543096498264678,0.0,0.049793811097907606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15802447539364778,0.0,0.0,0.08953863524231938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838479748796764,0.07977816662312627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130104852999753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11711849620870915,0.11031712171009772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06567445487564967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07137904036265075,0.16135533819170822,0.0,0.0,0.12951951546867074,0.18525473519455024,0.0,0.08505509017100023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08157619213158024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08908952365013567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07661862434763123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21216191241991225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11316214640381125,0.0,0.0,0.06832807525957182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06162797412833448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741645339209335,0.0,0.0,0.14597607571887866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3329800737815892,0.0,0.0,0.07761698354906575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892490654073592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0659365851262638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06152606285699501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585091103921626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059439729945496574,0.0,0.0,0.10929871879423277,0.0,0.0,0.1291013824575673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108423550624403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049472800539909635,0.0,0.0,0.18008617812007469,0.08874108877306733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508451400696462,0.0,0.0,0.3334215658672261,0.0,0.2548240573805095,0.04554022844621118,0.0,0.24773156791736764,0.0,0.0694207119465709,0.0,0.139339327787532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22483806274676627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09944091492603503

addiction,D-e-v-i-n,2019/02/26,"How is this even possible. I have tried for so long and still nothing has been able to keep me clean. I am clearly self medicating. I have been to rehab 3 times but eventually after a month or so I can take it anymore and want to be numb again. The thing I can fathom is why even though every ounce of my being doesn’t want to continually self destruct, I do it anyway. I’m so lonely too even though I have family I don’t have friends or people more than coworkers. I go to meetings every week but still I feel so alone in this regardless of whether I am or not. Ultimately I just am filling an empty whole and I need someone else to fill it. (notice I said whole, clean minds people) Any advice?

 I am a college student and I'm not sure if I am addicted to smoking weed or not. I smoke every night and I can't control myself when I do. I can't control my intake or for how long I am doing it. Once I've sobered up the next morning, I regret it until that itch comes for it again. Any tips or help for where I should go next? Any help is appreciated fellas and ladies.

addiction,MarvyMarshmellow,2019/02/26,GF broke up with me the day i started detox Been addicted to painkillers for 10 years and using Tramadol for the last 3 years straight. Met an amazing girl back in September and everything was going great till December when i had a huge panic attack and revealed to her what was going on. I thought she was behind me and would be supportive and boy was i wrong. Fast forward to last week when I'm about to start my treatment when i get a text from her telling me she is done with our relationship and refused to meet me in person or even talk to me. Now its a week later and i havent used anything other than the suboxone i am prescribed. I am an absolute mess otherwise and was hoping writing it out would help me find some closure or make me feel even a little bit better.,8.3598801843318,6.2306621677419365,8.043133640552998,76.83612903225809,62.806451612903224,11.179723502304153,37.62672811059908,9.606745405546679,3.3641889400921663,616,24,123,9,7,197,104,155,0.103,0.762,0.136,0.6621,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,1,0,0,1,8,10,1,1,9,0,15,2,0,3,0,26,29,14,0,3,2,0,1,0,1,2,2,0,0,3,4,11,0,1,4,0,0,3,1,5,0,0,10,1,21,5,20,16,2,28,0,1,0,0,17,9,0,4,18,87,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17635873235215568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13312711897906054,0.0,0.0,0.18404252507047925,0.0,0.12439506220469773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14307692493375984,0.1766165042588764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433155289690683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16555208920563136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21370184890085894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453930239862701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817983487839421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14785950594427535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08452081006937577,0.0,0.1838810290911232,0.0,0.0,0.17835761325391625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084344360451536,0.0,0.0,0.16067917159364675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26373658837097386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16214114494161766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10798613205625253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898082174848288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412557729186269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1736859092935742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2290104896574952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18358046058162672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13002869335652842,0.14139856347679727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12843135490464194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794434807799459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25953244602611464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22984077173888465,0.1768756704036177,0.0,0.20835571423369914

addiction,Swivials,2019/02/26,"A friend is addicted to cocaine, I don't know what to do anymore. I'd say the addiction started around a year ago, give or take a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, her doing coke wasn't such a big worry or red flag. She's always had some form of drug habit, whether it was Weed, Mkat or MDMA. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately though, her mental health has taken a turn for the worst, she's having suicidal thoughts, thoughts of self harm, weekly breakdowns.

&amp;#x200B;

For months myself, and her family have been telling her she needs to stop doing it. There's always been some sort of excuse.

This weekend is her belated birthday party, following an evening of mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts I told her she needs to stop doing coke, and not take any this weekend.

She told me she was going to, because she won't have any fun otherwise.

I told her that if she wants to do coke at her party, then I won't be there.

I can't watch her ruin herself even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that the right move?

addiction,Throwaway755t,2019/02/27,"Functioning substance abuse, addiction? Sorry if this is the wrong place. Throwaway account for obvious reason.

I’m 25, and I currently drink and smoke weed every singe day for the past 5-6 years. I only drink beer and between 2-4 drinks on weekdays and more on the weekends. I smoke  thc oil or bud once or twice after work weekdays and usually multiple times a day over the weekend and always through my drinking sessions. I can’t get my hands on much else, but once in awhile I’ll get access to a few random Xanax or lorab pills and I’ll mix those as well.

The thing is is that being 25, I am in an extremely specialized field, make double what most Americans make a year, I travel for work, have a home, nice car, girlfriend etc... so I think I rationalize my abuse as ok. I am an above class citizen, educated  with good credit and very responsible. You’d never really know me from the outside.

I don’t think I’m addicted to beer, or weed. I think I’m addicted to just being intoxicated no matter the substance. If I had access to coke, I’d do it. Psychedelics, uppers or downers I enjoy the same way. And more than likely they’d be mixed with beer and weed as they are my daily “routines”.

I rationalize these things as drugs or booze has never interfered with my family/ friends, works, or financial status. I have good self control and limit myself when I am resonably fucked up. My memory isn’t as good as it used to be, I’m gaining weight and recently get anxiety when I’m in a situation I forgot my thc pen or can’t have a beer.

Sorry for the rambling, just had to say this somewhere for others to see that couldn’t personally judge. I know one day learning to live sober is what will make me happiest but not today, I’m not ready yet.",3.94905016722408,5.369532646376811,5.215724637681159,81.30238294314383,71.81159420289856,8.554069119286511,27.47212931995541,9.057496981413335,2.206513935340022,1373,49,269,28,26,457,192,345,0.075,0.7929999999999999,0.132,0.9717,1,0,11,0,2,0,44.0,0,1,2,6,7,13,1,0,17,1,27,20,1,6,3,53,48,33,0,3,16,0,2,1,3,1,7,1,1,3,13,15,11,3,7,12,2,2,10,2,1,2,3,5,31,11,35,37,8,32,0,0,1,1,10,10,1,12,20,167,44,8,0.0,0.2340256214385563,0.0,0.3229844059676225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08217507982089459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07555007085325724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076618535323857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19107341148721488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38698338315737707,0.11452864066459754,0.0,0.08250015115998635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014196239542788,0.0,0.0,0.08320839332430624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310083378368746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630066166701656,0.09130074902921953,0.1547919020967373,0.0,0.0,0.2485021243514533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990629440382638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10855030508112766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04824847124090459,0.0,0.08720566718600807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1977664289698192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259894600230579,0.0,0.15233746572327558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2103494056129783,0.06692139403043043,0.07511037762957422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09427627365182777,0.0,0.08623221411102494,0.10318173392102144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06326729820775721,0.10154030537479504,0.09751221887818542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853681524840775,0.0,0.0,0.07869783055533752,0.0,0.10302677484293273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11100882210124312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.221104370037792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13122167223076792,0.18984160012175252,0.0,0.0,0.05758694313007176,0.0,0.09361162033626713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08529573541899747,0.10876866290741374,0.08148620096074842,0.0,0.07838999247035645,0.0,0.12026138844650115,0.0887958561317402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21569234576526702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10797704310507908,0.0,0.12719462142907315
addiction,tyranis129,2019/02/27,Im 17 and addicted to weed I live in india where im studying to get into medicine. The stress and is crazy and my doctor parents make it worse since i have to live up to their expectation or i might as well be kicked onto the streets. Anyway about 4 months ago i was introduced to marijuana by a friend. At first it was casual smoking for laughs and giggles but now im at 2 joints a day.

addiction,alico127,2019/02/27,"Urgent advice needed After 2 years of daily (every 45 mins) use in secret, my partner admitted his coke addiction to me and his mum last week.
He appeared full of remorse and drive to get clean. He went to some cocaine anonymous meetings and booked an assessment with a rehab.
Then 24 hours ago, his stash ran out.
He ordered more via the dark web but there’s been a shipping delay (I’m pretty sure his entire focus is now on this delivery) .
His whole attitude has changed and he’s done a complete u turn on rehab.
The plan was to go today but this seems highly unlikely.
I don’t know what to do.
Or do I do nothing?
I want him to get well and I know this needs to come from him.
All advice welcome!",2.6837234042553177,4.449914340425533,4.056329787234045,86.90875000000004,75.80851063829788,6.402127659574468,24.51595744680851,7.1686216300943375,1.0640680851063826,546,18,108,6,12,180,103,141,0.041,0.828,0.131,0.9154,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,1,3,3,0,0,6,0,9,4,0,1,2,25,26,9,0,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,1,4,8,1,1,5,1,0,6,1,0,1,0,5,0,13,3,16,21,5,24,0,0,0,0,17,6,0,4,11,65,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20276889750517685,0.0,0.3635166813656994,0.16487895065685182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19676473742942308,0.16022367056282627,0.19501884892771476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19034393228044905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15671413726925906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19435602927548812,0.0,0.10570883858042383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19652061052074948,0.0,0.0,0.18317383659159567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20444292614570347,0.1516159039660543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2758352492086853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17847328643772484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18923021474176285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16932861924640946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1753040462185484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17630750616945462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2023160284069291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16064542355525188,0.0,0.0,0.1097083997628667,0.0,0.14919904233166775,0.0,0.1672375277399569,0.1724250904061593,0.0,0.2076638352627504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11977875407867335

I got into a sub clinic and since i started crack. Its obvious i started due to the opiate blocker. Its nothing i crave. But i always find myself spending all my money, without thought. Then its to late. Hopefully i can get some advice to dig myself out of this. I hate myself so much every time. Its a terrible thing to not have control. or get tunnel vision when i have  cash. hopefully I'll figure it out. but any similar experiences or people who have over came this spiral id love to hear.",0.9051233396584486,3.4726067419354862,2.765996204933586,88.22340607210627,90.45161290322581,4.853130929791272,20.197343453510435,6.522977012572876,0.5282861480075907,492,16,92,6,17,163,86,124,0.04,0.85,0.109,0.7971,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,1,3,5,1,0,3,0,6,2,0,1,2,23,19,10,0,2,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,12,6,0,2,3,0,3,2,2,2,0,0,5,1,15,3,15,14,3,20,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,6,13,65,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16776427587279824,0.15218447560477527,0.0,0.17191330171607652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285199564978535,0.0,0.0,0.11674868161493708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1963568473538544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.192554368827042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14464829321853676,0.0,0.0,0.16793655021369866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15691293991377525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793920344475904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1373086431889647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16949902966345215,0.0,0.0,0.193496491085814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3410351067610236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3873263443621609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15494842635646208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12620498016070547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16473214681304918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11902169760874905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420159499191649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3645491945928087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11405694884339422,0.0,0.0,0.13629520365631298,0.10010832684837534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16549395273665882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2211133295722334

What do I need to do, what do I need to know and how can I make this a successful quit for good? I'm 23 and started using meth early on in December of last year. So it's been roughly three months. I am needing higher and higher dosages, I have been to a psyche ward for paranoia induced by crystal meth, and I have a really easy time getting meth...

What should I do? I have been on a bit of a bender - Been up since Monday and have been doing meth (smoking off tin foil) on and off. I'm out of it now, my friends and I don't have money for more and I don't have any way of getting any tonight. 

I drank some wine (not even 3 glasses) and am gonna chill for a bit and then go to bed thankfully. 

I really am quitting this, but I know it won't be easy and I want any and all advice you can give me for the journey ahead I now face. 

Please give me honesty and help me get into the right mind frame to give up the devil's drug once and for all.",1.901618925831201,2.694046865217395,3.3847314578005125,94.89308184143226,76.0,6.281329923273658,22.225063938618927,6.2272716619740125,0.12055242966751932,809,20,198,5,17,267,117,230,0.006999999999999999,0.852,0.141,0.9773,0,0,7,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,6,6,5,0,0,10,0,28,4,1,5,2,36,51,19,0,6,2,0,1,0,1,3,1,0,1,0,9,17,2,0,3,1,1,3,4,1,0,2,7,1,22,4,29,40,8,31,1,0,0,0,6,11,0,1,16,128,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121122470179561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23405978950176745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757643877529796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330496859571268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07577769015309455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08863965392593362,0.0,0.1798241369422228,0.3301766994231526,0.06520336496463175,0.09622958185474507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07690070197162592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12610456142485896,0.09351977803842748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658276891732556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158439936625714,0.0,0.2747277501524862,0.0,0.0,0.2552112008672863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12218307226764373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10952219924898823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12593843441103508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4881153793763152,0.0,0.0,0.14699718968200448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979782852440482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490534963414514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120606357095668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10562742200629524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668996388521302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19817873931141136,0.0,0.0,0.1353407515490127,0.09106686170236238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07388197545334622
addiction,OYMCON,2019/02/28,"Seeking advice for helping drop a nicotine addiction Hey everybody, I have been wrestling trying to beat my addiction to nicotine for a while now, but just can’t seem to keep traction with staying away from it. As a little background I started vaping relatively low amounts of nicotine my junior/senior years in high school. I never once saw it as a problem then, but as I have grown older it’s starting to affect me financially, mentally, and physically. Entering college I started to smoke ‘moles’ out of bongs, (a mole is a full bowl pack of weed mixed with cigarette tobacco, essentially a spliff in a bowl pack) and that really got my addiction going. I understand the physical addiction is over by 72 hours, but I always find myself going out of my way to find some nicotine. Anyone else been through what I am going through and have any tips or suggestions?

Not really fun as I didn’t speak to any friends or anybody fun. Money made me more confident though. I even tried to get a little more from buying and selling cars. I’ve got a healthy savings. Poor social life, 1-2 friends I see maybe every other month. Poor experience with girls which is my fault. I stay away from girls because they drive me mad, they pump me up with excitement quick and then the anxiety of when it will end kills me because I grew up very shy and very private but always with girls on my mind. 

So it’s winter, I’m inside all the time. Books, my favourite actors and comedians, music, cars. All getting increasing very very dull. What’s on my mind are the literal models that work over at the “spa”. 10 min drive and they are always available. On average it is $80 - $160 for 30 mins. I can hardly resist going every week now. It’s not that great often during the act too but I don’t want to stop. It stresses me but when I get home and I’m just sitting around doing nutin, negative vibes start coming so I give in sooner or later. I need to decide to continue or to stop. This addiction given me a lot of confidence and clarity in my life. Of course though its turning around as time passes. 

Anyone else got this problem? Did you continue? Was it worth it? When did you get tired of it? Please share.

addiction,sushionreddit,2019/02/28,"My experience with Sriracha, and why you should avoid it I'm sure you're all familiar with the bright red hot sauce this post is about. It's quickly become the most popular hot sauce for it's distinct flavor. However, there is a danger to it, one that people don't often take seriously: it can be terrifyingly addictive.

I am around two years clean now, but I still felt the need to share this story, to warn and protect others from going through the same thing. I became so addicted that I put Sriracha on everything I ate, savory or sweet. I wouldn't eat anything if it didn't have that damn sauce on it. 

After a few months of this, I started to throw up frequently. We didn't know what it was at first, but my doctor quickly rooted out the problem: my addiction was slowly burning through my stomach. I had to go cold turkey or I could seriously injure myself. I still suffer from the effects today, and my stomach has barely healed after two years. I never want anyone else to go through this, and felt the need to share it to the public. Please be careful when coming in contact with Sriracha.",4.9876572327044,6.263068740566043,5.451245283018872,81.15287421383648,69.14150943396226,7.9174842767295575,28.75597484276729,8.238735603445708,1.9811593710691828,871,31,162,12,15,279,133,212,0.069,0.7879999999999999,0.14300000000000002,0.9222,1,1,0,0,0,0,24.0,1,1,0,2,11,14,2,1,10,0,17,10,2,2,4,36,32,11,0,8,5,0,4,0,0,2,6,0,1,0,19,11,2,2,4,0,0,6,5,7,0,4,8,9,19,7,28,19,4,30,0,1,2,0,6,7,1,5,16,120,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4605670017454806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984695878793304,0.14429401369704728,0.11588871013347796,0.12536598265629256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15553247588661315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14358262161720822,0.0,0.0,0.12131008333085615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11243898604363868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14414251176754106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14410128838426448,0.11764297768330285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12656632353641556,0.137755933629141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27043221546486923,0.0,0.0,0.1197874656030365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2401058714724225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07739489527364965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11240685354846901,0.0,0.0,0.2088430314294433,0.10861454693374156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542809260058507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976317844766654,0.0,0.0,0.1545858743258439,0.0,0.0,0.13487344067009718,0.0,0.0,0.13475252265444068,0.0,0.14157013963343065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09967815144267383,0.0,0.22492941974837996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13272788209323647,0.0,0.10588445860633901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09355927256347384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13348763132277291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2751352418789181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306347664223353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12707456016272034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813760799201314
addiction,FoxOfTheCosmos,2019/02/28,"12 year DPH Addiction As the title suggests, I've been addicted to DPH (Diphenhydramine), for over 12 years now. I was originally prescribed it by a doctor, and ended up abusing it as I liked the sedating effect.
I've been weaning myself down for over a year now. At it's peak I was taking 350mg a day. Last night I took 15mg. 

I decided to quit, as I had developed insomnia and bouts of severe depression. I'm convinced my DPH abuse as been a huge factor. I used to take my DPH early in the evening, and had extreme anxiety when I missed a dose. This meant socializing after work was impossible, so another reason I wanted to kick this habit. 

My plan was to stop on Saturday. However, this morning I have thrown away the remaining pills. My insomnia had already started getting worse, and I'm suffering from extreme withdrawal already from being on such a low dose. I've had to stay off work the past two days, so figured I may as well just grind out the next few days cold turkey. I surely can't feel much worse than this. 

I guess my reason for posting, was to give inspiration to others in similar situation. I truly thought I would be addicted to this stuff my whole life, but I can now see light at the end of the tunnel. My depression has got a lot better recently, and although my insomnia has worsened, over time I think it will improve.

Good luck to all those who are going through something similar.",3.959600399600397,5.765035384615388,5.285442890442892,79.27054195804197,72.44322344322346,8.91968031968032,29.99150849150849,9.457814108942452,2.9145252747252752,1112,48,207,27,22,371,165,273,0.109,0.7829999999999999,0.108,0.1901,1,0,1,0,1,0,33.0,0,0,0,6,10,13,0,0,15,0,23,11,0,5,2,29,42,15,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,3,11,0,0,0,13,6,0,1,10,0,0,2,1,5,1,1,16,4,26,8,40,21,5,44,0,5,1,0,4,16,0,4,25,140,39,3,0.0,0.26190255995106115,0.0,0.36145804133417264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2439290085167633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158926462553068,0.08454953282176053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10383967778845296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977483117448841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2138339182670339,0.0,0.19038601119595416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11312462633889638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19578054480167065,0.0,0.0,0.07299917494204686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05588357801826725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05774352849291683,0.10602340695211444,0.06281257499729828,0.09270116397349287,0.08839506809453246,0.0,0.1217531710521158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09009071962705856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780654237035497,0.05399578923898196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396241368835402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124687241881698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11754210336779605,0.10371802993401907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550638541320212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585015754028117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11755445401874688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22727140517692,0.10912779375915542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08807225105670415,0.0,0.0,0.12485914741882315,0.0,0.0,0.12423210119794847,0.0,0.11266393400365357,0.0,0.08508574375497026,0.0,0.0,0.07822850800802833,0.11780245065905785,0.0,0.09240189311315364,0.0,0.0,0.1265220040370852,0.0,0.0,0.10416629960469162,0.0,0.1661985720667281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07081845818342974,0.0,0.0877426469911125,0.06444665217770529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12279474254866905,0.0,0.0,0.10796457980560638,0.0,0.0,0.09545609289198707,0.0,0.0,0.06518912874722282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09937314508981973,0.0,0.0,0.12339460353397255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609236264261047,0.0,0.2252640666705246,0.07851212701845023,0.0,0.0,0.21351890933677076

addiction,Akephalos37,2019/02/28,"I unsubbed a few months ago but I need some help (cannabis). I unsubbed awhile back because every time I’d scroll through my feed and see an r/addiction post it would remind me of my problem and just cause turmoil. But I’m falling apart and I need some advice

My weed addiction is off the fucking chain. I get high (or at least I try to, as my tolerance is ridiculous) around 5 times per day. It’s not enjoyable for me anymore really, but being off cannabis feels like I’m literally going insane. I get massively derealized when I leave my house sober, it’s like being in the fucking twilight zone. When I’m not high I can’t eat, depression/anxiety are amplified severely and I can’t sleep.

I’ve been smoking everyday for a over a year now and It’s showing in my relationships and my grades. I know my problem is a product of my life circumstances, but I just need some tips on how to survive the initial psychological and physiological withdrawal.

addiction,schmyndles,2019/03/01,"Setting him up to fail My (35f) boyfriend (32m) relapsed on heroin a year ago. He’s been in different levels of treatment over this time, and last week tried to get back into residential treatment. He had a week in residential in November and stepped down, saying he was ready (he was ready to go use again really), then his insurance gave him a week again in December, after which he stepped down to day treatment again.  These two weeks are the only days he’s been able to go without using, and the only way he’s been able to go without using long enough to get on Suboxone.  But as soon as he would step down, he’d be back using again. He was lying and using fake pee for drug tests, so on paper, over the past couple months of day treatment and IOP, he looks like someone in recovery. Unfortunately it’s all lies.

Our relationship has, as expected, gone to hell, especially since he cleaned out all my bank accounts, and I told him he has to get clean or get out. He went back for his assessment last week, told them how he’s been lying and using, and that he needs some time in residential to get his mind right. But his insurance denied him, and he couldn’t get a reason out of them, although I’m sure it’s related to his lack of effort during previous stays. He started day treatment, but couldn’t stop using every day. This week his doctor said he was going to get him back in residential, I called into work yesterday so that I could drop him off and he wouldn’t have an easy way to leave, brought all his things, and his insurance denied him again! So I picked him up. 

He didn’t even want to go to group today because of his depression, but I talked him into it, and told him to bring his stuff just in case. And he called me at noon saying his doctor fought the insurance and got him 4 days residential. Four. Days. 

This system is so messed up! He’s been paying money into his insurance for years, and now that he needs to use it, some guy in an office gets to decide what medical treatment he needs? Even after calls from doctors, addiction professionals saying he needs this, they still will only allow him to do the day treatment, which hasn’t worked the last three times he did it. I’m grateful that he has a few days to get on the Suboxone, but it’s not nearly enough to break those habits he’s formed using.

Why is this system so screwed up? How many people have slipped through the cracks and been lost because an insurance company decided their life was only worth X amount? I went to the same treatment center, the best in my area, five times for my heroin and alcohol addictions. I had one of the best insurance plans available, according to the staff, and I was denied residential benefits every time, even while detoxing from alcohol. They would keep an eye on my vitals while I was there during the day, but I still had 16 hours a day with no medical supervision. I know this is more of a rant than an actual question, but I’m so frustrated when I read studies saying addicts need 2-3 months of treatment, but you have to plead and beg for four days, and they wonder why the relapse rates are so high? The only people I’ve even known to get 30 days of inpatient treatment are those who pay cash, and most addicts don’t have $30-40k just lying around. Thanks for listening to my rant, and if anyone has any suggestions of how he can get the most out of these four days, please let me know.

TLDR: Bf has bad heroin addiction, insurance finally gave him 4 days of inpatient treatment after staff fighting all week for him. Why is the system set up to fail addicts who are trying to get help?",7.926973957899988,6.445431397454032,7.757895415591983,76.47889986687748,63.172560113154184,11.146501372826359,33.241076628671266,10.056822442137396,2.980630784591064,2846,88,563,50,34,913,292,707,0.133,0.8009999999999999,0.066,-0.9945,1,0,3,0,2,0,83.0,1,1,6,9,32,19,5,0,29,0,49,19,2,15,5,96,106,50,0,15,15,0,0,1,1,4,16,6,2,1,27,32,2,2,8,1,7,13,10,12,0,7,31,8,55,7,97,65,18,129,1,4,2,1,90,42,2,8,65,349,82,16,0.09188200589531573,0.0,0.044831791807567065,0.3004948461580287,0.0,0.0,0.04072392719159748,0.09819392119978064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031241457388525545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032123017442525915,0.0,0.0,0.040897232681653344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413031819914951,0.03835881850431922,0.05601041797583868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642449651784936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14073270156484907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036680152600271985,0.050832845949742037,0.0,0.444422194453376,0.0,0.039568918520806656,0.0,0.0,0.047998570036263816,0.0,0.1410676896117128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053276978116160716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09493867369823053,0.0,0.12137439666804033,0.0,0.07741455280522315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05032612315067575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2880273347421641,0.0,0.13054665342991176,0.0,0.036743216847730666,0.0,0.0,0.0454888157523756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03079328588103484,0.04853919195028979,0.0,0.0,0.045242633793119214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0408344742814573,0.0,0.0,0.050495947518021035,0.11234414719897257,0.0,0.048644888764406265,0.0,0.0469777881121595,0.032449489018798766,0.02244445347053239,0.0,0.0,0.04065634192962369,0.03857887193877784,0.0,0.050150031659071934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0465769662633863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09256145446224907,0.0,0.0,0.046387316669339984,0.0,0.0733393405001723,0.0,0.0,0.17032335784676828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031130812559834367,0.17470101461286106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043855885646377116,0.06369941386435263,0.0,0.0,0.050429425412265375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051464437393824884,0.0,0.045953435235506095,0.0,0.02943098287488209,0.047235002493428414,0.0,0.04932344422538782,0.0,0.039233365499924365,0.043700414187040536,0.14613651792326826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03800287237952773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038925662713361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03251727834339673,0.04896699649725801,0.0733770885968247,0.03840873556618071,0.0,0.0,0.05259145708641207,0.0,0.0,0.04329885158873025,0.0,0.0,0.03692563795506503,0.0,0.04229630314579805,0.0,0.0,0.03052116099185348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13394284133269233,0.0,0.043546699053901454,0.1316957912247499,0.0,0.06238185070965008,0.0,0.0448776843910468,0.0,0.0,0.3571044851885703,0.0,0.0,0.0270971938288715,0.07293165952436148,0.2579577101222222,0.0,0.0,0.08517553999138387,0.12436382848308515,0.0,0.0,0.08857097486605779,0.04982105798475442,0.06689119460119852,0.0,0.0,0.06527034076449623,0.0,0.0,0.059168999326688114

addiction,throw-far-far-away55,2019/03/01,"Addicted spouse won't admit there is a problem. I don't know what to do.
My spouse has had problems with prescription drug addition in the past. During stressful times it has come up. We had two open discussions and there were promises it would never happen again.  Things were good for a long time.
We had a major crisis a year ago and the pill issue happened again. I confronted my spouse, but was lied to. Then got the truth, but basically blown off and told there is just too much going on (pills always seem to come into use during stressful times). I let it go because we truly were in crisis mode. Things did get better though, but it was likely still happening some.
Now I suspected it was happening again. I admit I snooped and saw proof. I confronted my spouse and was lied to. I did not mention what I saw, just brought up my concerns and suspicions.  I asked to see his phone and was yelled at. I was told I am not being trustful and if I had that much doubt we would have a drug test done.  I said ""no"" as that only proves the drugs haven't been taken recently (and I am not sure if they would test for the right thing).  I was accused of being terrible for bringing this up during a very stressful time. This is true, the timing is awful as we have a very stressful situation to face at the moment. Ultimately I was adamantly denied phone access. 
So I am at a loss now. We aren't speaking.  I am trying to figure out how to proceed. Push for the truth by admitting what I saw or trying to further put holes in the lies I was told.  The reaction to asking to see the phone is honestly damning enough (snatched the phone, kept it away, left the room and cried).
I don't want this to ruin my marriage, but enough is enough.",3.095937910809994,4.960978199413494,3.910231570431794,87.97155425219944,74.92375366568915,6.814885226008697,23.78208110021236,7.6298220110432995,1.063563373445242,1350,41,272,18,29,431,173,341,0.228,0.7070000000000001,0.066,-0.9958,0,0,3,0,0,0,43.0,6,0,1,2,16,23,3,5,21,1,46,7,1,2,7,60,78,23,0,8,12,4,0,1,0,4,6,3,1,0,17,23,0,1,8,0,0,8,10,13,0,1,31,8,35,10,35,40,7,47,0,2,5,0,29,19,1,6,21,199,52,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09669664514907234,0.0,0.0,0.0786276474369545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07380592734561578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16584600042613293,0.0,0.08333704602428023,0.0,0.0,0.0540710056851954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844839013536448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15281526513700086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743334171578824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09077141466201306,0.0,0.0,0.3085932821838567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2749540041370349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04634235384880656,0.0,0.10082108428952566,0.07439777677567486,0.07094189827053379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3137502610652177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09258028403242574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04874747884409732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096373360222739,0.0907022778935956,0.0,0.043334587209464176,0.0,0.0,0.07849715731684874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041015708638304,0.0,0.06841129909269926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746073245456775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467467045639482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16974881157368946,0.0,0.08916850862496334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08758104960189117,0.0,0.0,0.07574974819544701,0.08437449422256275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14136563972641092,0.08074961007486074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09970308610084833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083633934661038,0.0,0.406424523619054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08359917797530447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17678602615190311,0.0,0.08714779761946657,0.0,0.25860989426343545,0.0,0.0,0.2542714064051986,0.0,0.1204436433889688,0.0,0.08664750650114611,0.0,0.0,0.07660875857919988,0.0,0.1463744152336078,0.05231785708886468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189030885365333,0.0,0.0,0.057120218248697514
addiction,Peltron_3030,2019/03/01,I want to quit Hi. I’m writing because I feel somewhat like I am being honest with some one and trying to get this weight off my shoulders. I was clean for a lil over three years and about 7-8 months ago my father died. My first reaction was to cry and go to his house to see where he died. He was alone for five days before he was found. Luckily it wasn’t by me. I immediately ate a handful of vicoden or hydrocodone. Who knows. Fast forward to now and I am a daily heroin / Fent user. Ive blown through a lot of money and I am maybe even more sad/depressed than I was before. I want to quit but I have a full time job and I dunno what to do. Should I go to a clinic or just try and kick it with kratom? Please. Any kind words and advice would help me.

I don't know what to do.
This past year has been the most stressful of my life. Not going into details, but it was a life threatening situation with a child.  We got through it and everyone is ok now, we just have some extra doctor's appointments and such.
So my spouse has had issues with prescription meds in the past. We've had 2 ""come to Jesus"" moments with tears and ""I promise to never do it again.""  Things were better for over a year, then the situation I mentioned before happened....
Figured out my spouse was using again about a year ago, but had worse things to deal with and it kind of got swept under the rug.   That time I was lied to about using and basically blown off with how much stress we were under (which was true) and it couldn't be helped. 
Just figured out it happened again, well more likely never stopped. I confronted my spouse, but am being blatantly lied to about it. My spouse will not admit it. I do not have definitive proof I can show anyone, but I know it is happening.
I am hurt and angry and stressed beyond belief. I am lost. I don't want a divorce. We have kids and overall my spouse is fantastic, but this has to stop. I can't get my spouse to even admit it, so I have no hope to get this to stop.",2.596199342825848,4.514116325301206,3.6096330777656114,89.34222617743704,76.51004016064256,6.615626140927348,22.161555312157727,7.520522993642371,0.7681228915662652,971,27,203,13,22,312,129,249,0.19,0.718,0.092,-0.9782,0,0,0,0,1,0,36.0,4,0,0,2,16,14,1,3,9,1,34,4,0,3,5,55,52,18,0,3,10,7,0,1,0,1,4,0,1,2,18,22,0,3,7,1,0,2,10,6,1,0,13,0,24,8,31,35,5,29,2,2,0,0,19,9,0,3,19,154,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979663014272608,0.0,0.0,0.10554247934489952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325186539531887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131414472339308,0.0,0.0,0.10530186092800416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025625367796962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274908979824938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218663878447431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07864022232597567,0.0,0.0,0.11377013698240307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12441137648950977,0.0,0.0676664478273356,0.0,0.19045168148797376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3158619918758617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07980565635947004,0.0,0.0,0.11825677543052072,0.0,0.0,0.12745978285777934,0.0,0.0,0.12427120782256608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12398616110580753,0.13086821103593094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16819593593742346,0.05816834058454912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12997171553768386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13225254525137134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08752526470851639,0.0,0.1836579970738247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2273188871597854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676643966451888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986268854488382,0.4091600087970224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15820080359193311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06942679913085414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.205665019456845,0.0,0.0,0.07022665094486491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10705225407408887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12133572947288128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2300186887642744
addiction,Maya_Urban,2019/03/02,"A story as old as time: Man addicted to meth, I'm addicted to him I've posted about this guy before, but it wasn't the whole story. 


TL;DR Met hot guy, did meth with hot guy, euphoria, now I don't have a pot to piss in.


It was the perfect storm. I was lonely, going through a dry spell, and along came this stud muffin. Even before I knew about his addiction, I could already feel myself getting attached. Then I made the fatal mistake of doing meth with him. Being a chronic user, he knew how much to give me at certain intervals so I wouldn't freak out or OD; he walked me through every step of the way. The high was what sealed the deal. The way he guided me, the sex... There was just something so primal and intimate about the experience that the feeling has been permanently etched into my brain. 


Then came the crash. Oh my the god the crash. I lied there wide-eyed, depressed, questioned all my life choices, including the meth I just did and the man who gave it to me (who, btw, was happily snoring and twitching away beside me while all this was going down). All my self-doubt and insecurities were confirmed that night. It was soul crushing. I vowed to never touch meth or get involved with an addict ever again. 

...Yet my mind keeps going back to those intimate moments. The memory is almost like a drug itself, it triggers this yearning that turns into sadness because I know I'll never experience it again. I think this is why I'm having such a hard time forgetting him -- and I don't want to forget him, we had SO much fun (really not helping here, scumbag brain). 


Like I said, perfect storm. I'd like to say I've learned my lesson, but I honestly don't know if I'd be strong enough to resist (either the guy or the drug) if a similar situation pops up again. Chances are I'll gladly walk into the obvious dumpster fire, knowing full well I'll come out with yet another piece of me destroyed. I hope future me will have more self discipline than that though. I don't want to feel this kind of pain again. 


Kudos to you all who fight much stronger urges on the daily. Much respect 👊",3.1897497393117824,5.084552291970809,4.148838373305527,86.23278832116789,74.74209245742092,6.83826207855405,24.881543274244,7.658307877764058,1.266361918665276,1636,54,322,22,35,528,228,411,0.138,0.68,0.182,0.9773,1,2,8,0,1,0,64.0,1,1,0,4,25,26,3,1,28,0,30,15,3,3,11,70,59,23,2,9,11,0,8,3,0,2,10,2,0,7,22,20,0,2,12,0,0,9,9,12,1,0,21,10,37,14,40,33,14,45,1,4,0,2,30,13,1,8,23,212,59,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3927001743268133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09017872835887204,0.0,0.09937975492362164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944322518451992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08461118907270195,0.06924800655126515,0.0,0.05489769920628433,0.0,0.1532631557957212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20106601439317012,0.0,0.20600163712953504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07757583156916037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07190290867527448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09284445387608464,0.07756566243837927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2088742505369236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09305259521500646,0.0,0.059481569326090576,0.08146139760832435,0.07587661345293717,0.0,0.0,0.17618537241822954,0.0,0.0,0.13660604750899466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09410176747644793,0.08639054668517984,0.1535438121273909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35668097681416905,0.0,0.0,0.08067307129621001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0603630755478168,0.095149797330653,0.0,0.08944657553094187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08004649018392296,0.0,0.09378014480580787,0.14847834232426813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0636096766255195,0.13199139374459726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08521378163639763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09093154629192728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2648080051942785,0.0,0.13891448373524307,0.0,0.0,0.08451206733204361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944993071536363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09582662723370808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08624937869377658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008840607147619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057692597327431025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856644988532339,0.07161666430936175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878974574017272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122745011567763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06933001050821648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05770466629723815,0.08848020338400203,0.0,0.1050255160386649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979557769979012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10623549331793733,0.1429655571901162,0.0,0.0,0.08097174555060846,0.0,0.08126212104745044,0.10054503589113646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,exheavyaddict,2019/03/02,"PLEASE HELP!! 1 month clean from HEAVY fentanyl addiction. Not having normal PAWS symptoms Since the day I left my 7 day detox I've had this weird persistent head jolt that makes my left shoulder and head violently jolt left everytime and its followed by the shivers throughout my entire body. Seconds before it happens I can feel the static in my back and then BAM! At worst it happens about every minute and at best a few times an hour, even when I'm warm. The jolt has gotten more violent since it first started. Its painless but its extremely irritating and embarrassing out in public. It's as if you had a cringe from nails on a chalkboard ×100.

Other symptoms are lack of motivation, concentration, HORRIBLE memory, no energy, feeling depleted and its now been 4 weeks of having the shits 20 times a day. I basically live on the toilet now1

I started lifting weights again 3 days after detox and go 6 days a week and have been eating the required daily macros, that hasnt helped it at all. 

I have seen 4 doctors of different types, tried calling my detox center for 2 weeks now and left a voicemail with the doctors every other day and they WILL NOT call me back. Ive called over 50 other doctors and they all pointed me in a different direction. Not a single doctor will help me or give me an answer. They havent helped at all.

I took my last dose of suboxone hours before it started on the day that I left detox. I didnt take any other medication that day. While in detox they had me on robaxin and vistaril. They didnt give me any comfort meds to take home so I called them later that day and they gave me a weeks worth of flexirol, vistaril and trazadone.

A week later my psych put me on robaxin, gabapentin, adderall and propranolol. I saw a doctor last week and he upped my doses on everything and gave me clonidine for the shivers but it didnt work and the side effects were terrible for me so I quit taking it after a few days.

The one consistent I was on since my first day in there was trazodone but I stopped taking it a few days ago and I still have this issue.


So has anyone else had this or does anyone know if this is a PAWS symptom or is this something I was masking while on opiates? Or is it from a certain mediction?

addiction,mistoffwatson,2019/03/02,"please share your story with me  If anyone is able and willing i would love to read some of your storys with addiction, so please comment below as I feel it is important to hear other people's perspectives and opinions about addiction. Also it feels good knowing other people can understand.

I have struggled with addiction for basically most of my life, and I am 20 years old. I started young and started off small and over the years have been introduced and trapped by my drugs of choice which are crack, heroin and meth. These drugs are my worse enemies but the sad truth is they are also my best friends. I started what I called my road to recovery because within the past maybe 5-6 months I went to a detox, got into a recovery home and have been going to na/aa meetings. Sadly the reality is (and as much as I am ashamed of myself I need to get it out) that I have continuously relapsed and ended up back where I started if not even worse. I dont know if I'll ever be able to stay clean, because a part of me doesnt want to quit, but also a part of me needs to get clean so I can help others, I find that talking to others and helping then actually helps me. I dont really know what else to put now as I dont want to just ramble, so fellow addicts what are your storys. Hope everyone is doing good and if not then keep fighting and surviving, we can make it one day.

addiction,indyferret,2019/03/02,"New here Sorry, don’t know about rules or anything. Am new here.
Have been taking painkillers for some time, for genuine pain but lately for jollies. I’m an idiot. I absolutely am definitely addicted to these.
I need to get control over this before it destroys me completely. I’ve went from 6 pills a day to nearly 20 and I’m not even getting anything from them my body is screaming out for more.
I’m so low rn
I’m also on antidepressants for chronic depression and am not currently working which is making me feel worse.
So I don’t know what I’m looking for here? Advice I suppose. 
I should add that my partner is a recovering heroin addict (which is why I should’ve seen this coming) so talking to him is a last last last resort.",1.70718864097363,4.290297179310347,3.3612981744421937,86.15557809330629,84.10344827586206,5.618661257606491,24.391480730223122,7.048011613610866,1.1953245436105484,581,23,110,8,17,192,94,145,0.215,0.7340000000000001,0.051,-0.9792,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,1,2,9,6,2,0,4,0,13,6,1,2,0,17,30,8,0,2,4,0,1,0,1,1,5,1,0,1,8,5,0,1,3,0,0,2,4,6,0,0,3,4,12,0,17,26,2,16,0,2,2,0,4,5,0,2,9,70,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3531026595100017,0.0,0.1582573912293443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295127686387039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26654500821964044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13780902442718826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17989190244721895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13950710609042966,0.16980334523246404,0.0,0.18164267643896911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444549103796028,0.0,0.1394888186163797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10696761394046088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08188767891986842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1692262266880119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1780089102131941,0.39603691374605393,0.18268864600122275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13599869471951942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10810406128096366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008518229442,0.0,0.31282804928656804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1723280973129201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812917426827433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12176757277327632,0.13017069476639234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09443537704875116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150130909468285,0.146136278693876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179028143750405,0.0,0.1650426853276109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,hwysnbrknhearts,2019/03/02,"Im addicted to Crystal Meth.I need to stop using but I enjoy the high.i even enjoy tweeking when paranoia sets in.i sometimes I think cars are following me.and wherever I'm at I look for hidden cameras and bugs.someone is gonna get hurt whether it's me or an innocent person bc of this addiction. I have a good job.but I'm also gambling with the dangers of the industry and the consequences if something where to happen.I drive an 18 wheeler.so imagine how I feel when paranoia sets in.i want to be normal again.i been locked up twice.never possession.i done 6 months last year then out 5 months but turned myself in and did another six.I just got out 3 weeks ago and I'm back doing this stupid shit.my boss knows my past and has given me a chance.He will find out.he knows when I been using.my mom.sister n bro in law support me since I trying to get my life back.i just mended that fence last year.but I'm lying to everyone and to myself.just yesterday I was talking to a fellow driver n we talked about addiction.i been clean about 5 yrs.i told him I don't want to get high...after dropping him off at his truck....i went and got a bag.
    
      I just feel like life isn't enjoyable if I'm gonna be sober.everything we do.all activities we engage into are just better when high.if I don't have none or run out I get really lazy and depressed.so much so I think about suicide.i cry a lot.im single and have a 14 yr old daughter who worships the ground I walk on.i know I need to be here for her...but I even lie to her.im so wrong bc I tell her to always be upfront with me,and honest but hear me say it and you'll say hypocrite.i do my best to fulfill my promises.i usually do.but
       
      Please someone.hear me crying.I don't have friends and 90% of the time I'm alone.I haven't had sex in over a year and masturbating is getting old.Meth addiction is getting old.im fairly good looking..im 42 yr old and women really do think I'm handsome.you wouldn't think of me as a person who is addicted to meth.but just bc I don't look like death on the outside doesn't mean much since I feel like I'm rotting on the inside.
     Thanks for taking time out to read my situation.i tend to drift in my explanation but hope I reached the correct subreddit.",2.5309845087647806,4.865593127802698,3.5761863024867497,87.47708418263352,78.48430493273543,6.834814512841419,24.934569914390543,7.924219607001951,1.5032753363228704,1789,66,352,31,44,575,243,446,0.097,0.733,0.17,0.9866,1,1,4,0,0,1,60.0,3,1,0,2,21,21,2,0,19,0,35,7,0,3,1,64,82,32,1,9,14,2,3,3,2,5,6,3,1,3,7,23,0,2,13,1,1,7,9,4,0,0,12,8,41,17,45,61,5,50,1,1,2,1,24,18,0,5,25,192,48,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3198104117307827,0.0,0.0,0.06501244242100905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05865083531261859,0.06102565393086975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07690451728229869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11278952714834035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696693885081522,0.06486422540857062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08056173273228398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07505338849059982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968821835089838,0.0,0.0,0.07008054506307404,0.06591423379448022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11125036135687667,0.10478976465193282,0.0,0.0,0.06703241858748088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05666313660706392,0.0,0.2299061240766733,0.0,0.0,0.1230300368011873,0.11731512329039873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06485527497956224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16532145523244215,0.0,0.0,0.23246663370532855,0.0,0.07284424102305748,0.0,0.0,0.07851314319570371,0.0,0.3961047598677019,0.0,0.0727797053520135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12091901887548018,0.11956553808031795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10360594775157617,0.10749224150649243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231760718354673,0.0,0.0,0.062351963656638226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988993697690454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08589618668905466,0.11708030095010084,0.0,0.10782826531203683,0.1087629632856298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185868677848349,0.0,0.0,0.3078365053530825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0700123597361634,0.0,0.12807720461000416,0.0,0.08050648211098684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336092730546688,0.0,0.0939683479220914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11664754128935655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752835648523885,0.12133699880088038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0621416592251974,0.056461546633997224,0.07253620361230967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061316427016284876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322658864305894,0.0,0.0,0.05514336487598232,0.11789756425593502,0.06410333670543504,0.06752261293343781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18797601115347493,0.0,0.0,0.08553154727812902,0.0,0.0,0.07008054506307404,0.0,0.0497937791988526,0.07977403480100395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06334314542564326,0.08077483825483919,0.0,0.08651693856941725,0.0,0.058829790644680774,0.0,0.0,0.06798791608819517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018695788761117,0.0,0.1416877531384813
addiction,sillypseudoephedrine,2019/03/02,"Craving pseudoephedrine I used amphetamine paste and RC stims, but now I am addicted to the relatively mild pseudoephedrine. I take high doses of it, I call it pseudospeed. Some might say that it is not possible to get hooked on this drug, but after a lot of searching I came across a few stories of addicts like myself.

I was an off and on (ab)user of the paste, binged around two days every two to four weeks. This was years ago. In the meantime I had periods of a few months where didn‘t use at all. Because I became quite paranoid when buying illegal drugs, I resorted to pseudoephedrine to keep it legal and with stuff of pharmaceutic quality, after I discovered how I must dose it to get the speedy effects. Perhaps I have a susceptibility for it, I quite liked the high even more than the high from amphetamine paste and RCs. Then the daily use sneaked in.

Three years ago I was productive and euphoric when on it, these times I often get stuck in front of my computer without doing anything useful. The mental sharpness and clarity gave way to a dull mind and a loss of empathy. The motivational bonus it gave me is now almost an addiction in itself, to aimlessly browse around the net. I can only sleep about one to three hours when the effects have worn off and have very intense dreams. The comedown is manageable, but sucks anyway. I do and say things I regret. My mental illness is pushed more into a psychotic realm. My daily routine is replaced with dull things I don‘t even enjoy. I don‘t practice my musical instruments anymore. I don‘t go for a run after having planned it. My meditation practice is disturbed by intruding thoughts. I impair my brain and my heart and my cognitive abilities suffer. I have pipe dreams of my future but miss the energy to pursue a goal.

I want to get off it, but the cravings seem to be unmanagable. I know it sounds silly! I don‘t seem to have any skills to distract me, everything is focused on buying and taking it when experiencing the urge for it. Not having to wait for unreliable contacts but going directly into the pharmacy and buying has made it even easier to keep on taking it. I may be weak willed, but I need coping skills to deal with the cravings. I‘ll ask my psychiatrist about Bupropion, as I don‘t see any solution for this problem. Maybe I‘ll visit a self help group for dual diagnosis. I had three appointments with an addiction counselor, which helped a bit. Again, the whole ordeal sounds silly, having an addiction to a relatively mild stimulant which some compare to caffeine, but I hope sharing your story here is not a contest in taking the most of the most addictive drugs. I am helpless.",6.393813491328764,7.6580618553971505,6.578918718755784,74.39575942726655,65.88391038696537,9.536036536443868,32.39406282787138,9.725611199111238,3.2142608282416845,2125,86,361,44,33,681,253,491,0.118,0.7559999999999999,0.126,0.5358,0,0,3,0,1,0,52.0,0,1,0,11,20,20,1,2,37,0,39,16,3,10,2,68,73,28,0,6,12,0,1,2,0,4,13,4,0,1,26,22,0,3,7,2,4,7,10,12,0,7,13,7,46,8,68,54,12,56,0,7,1,0,15,23,1,12,27,274,72,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.494557812114649,0.0,0.0,0.1340477987565951,0.0,0.07571271504678806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283508693002197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07498502274296537,0.0,0.0,0.0622207699587588,0.134618255022886,0.07068535055539474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04609128929151466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08254677909870622,0.0,0.0,0.0844060130941388,0.07720648997120468,0.08647795070413547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04876233784687831,0.07795081842383364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26305155715734224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498195147862383,0.0,0.06370487273024765,0.0,0.06795359178831868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15801288033227098,0.0,0.08594206273372587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08959847663114147,0.10135987547111952,0.2396590511917529,0.0,0.07509801045468982,0.07446083774515845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13441167805499718,0.0,0.0,0.04155340040679994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387867009644529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642811065472492,0.0,0.07154421984551139,0.0,0.0,0.07596063028994951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15239463929416422,0.08021049652093189,0.07634476975286793,0.0,0.06035135750817835,0.0,0.0,0.05606402125407472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051235442956137266,0.05750498064496501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2165355359427652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523916419623953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07234877067651732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16084155541056208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202565659581675,0.0,0.0,0.06025155731747416,0.1376654120253012,0.07887795109318235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07566482638606208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655561413156196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22739790730484735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1004641430381932,0.0,0.0,0.06002607019739041,0.044088928249424515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14772039979371768,0.0,0.09094978692967028,0.2612118202125093,0.0,0.062386351353325376,0.044596867686062316,0.06001587453065711,0.06064995901986287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441611220664047,0.0,0.07288555545405777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09738100744873016
addiction,DeaconPryce,2019/03/02,"Need Advice M. 25. Prefer to keep genders of the people private.

I have a very close friend who is a recovering addict coming up on 2 years sober (their poison was pain pills). This person lives with me currently, and after a brief period of adderall abuse and a severance of our communication, has returned to my life and taken steps to prove they are trying to improve and come out of the hole they were in recently.

The problem now is that my other roommate, a younger person I haven’t known very long (it’s student housing/I get random roommates) has just privately confided in me (while rather drunk) that they believe my friend is stealing their adderall. However, this roommate has shown to smoke weed/drink/drop LSD/etc excessively and is clearly very forgetful of where they put anything - losing their keys, wallet, apartment keys, Jules and anything else on more than one occasion.

How should I handle this? I have faith in my friend that they are not stealing, but this is a very serious accusation. Should I confide in them what I’ve been told, with the assurance that I don’t believe it? Or should I leave it alone?

In the morning, during lunch (I use my workplace's shower), when I get home from work, and before bed. I don't sweat or get dirty easily, my job is sedentary, and I don't do strenuous activities. On the weekends I can take up to 14 showers. 

I think this all started when I was a teenager during summers. My parents were poor so we didn't ever go anywhere and I was a big introvert so I just stayed home all day. A ton of masturbation and boredness lead to requiring multiple showers. I think I just really loved the refreshingness a shower provided, the warmth and smoothness of the water, and soothing whitenoise of water burbling down the drain!

This addiction is severely impacting my life mentally and financially. I have to hold gym memberships to all the area's gyms just in case I'm away from home and the urge to shower is overpowering. The utility bill is enormous. I don even use soap, shampoo or conditioner. I just wash my body off with water and then get into my clothes witout even drying myself off (that's another weird thing I kinda like). But realistically the main thing is that since I spend so much time showering or thinking about showering I'm missing out on my life where I could be meeting people, learning a skill or enriching myself. I don't have any friends just coworkers. And they're not even really my friends. And I would really like to have some people that genuinely cared about me and we had fun times together. It's just a huge time sink. And it's making me waste my life. 

I'm even writing this post from my shower on my phone, I've been standing here so long the water is getting cold. 

So anyone else out there like me? Anyone got over it? Anyone in general with some advice? I'm so desperate,..",3.5650642857142856,5.87025554571429,4.791053571428575,80.19400892857145,74.97142857142858,8.260714285714286,27.794642857142854,9.017664075816787,2.534635714285714,1451,59,266,34,32,478,183,350,0.061,0.8440000000000001,0.095,0.9121,13,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,2,0,0,4,25,10,0,0,18,0,24,14,2,4,4,54,46,27,0,2,12,1,1,3,2,1,6,0,14,0,11,21,5,2,4,3,3,2,5,2,0,0,7,2,38,8,33,36,8,39,0,1,0,1,10,21,0,7,16,175,49,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22746300369502795,0.0,0.10194684349282332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07094573329554303,0.10939564102417934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29179061652386995,0.21379006515677249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801836857178403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08877433740088217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11588344457059616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10636802333107223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329638055151987,0.0,0.0,0.13456418111868473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17430314134137026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2756272048333093,0.09436947267440644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16120509875424888,0.0,0.21802557862264174,0.0,0.059291267636354776,0.0,0.08343959215733729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06992798768125633,0.0,0.3139445581664908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352815155589044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22106709986742398,0.15290626715155625,0.0,0.0,0.09232584624464013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09415891964507796,0.0,0.06963888214470629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10513677537309342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766921282467412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11584245375914087,0.0,0.0,0.1446539951994238,0.0,0.0,0.11451938752575948,0.0,0.0,0.09991613972745224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20050306575332494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178594752209242,0.0,0.08630012405544114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07384297499817884,0.11119838074693013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15688138907873506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13862004711685846,0.20054500987716253,0.0,0.0,0.18250121266480865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18020954407371412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07595107989008049,0.0,0.0,0.07411069417151964,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,MysticGlitz,2019/03/03,Im ruining my relationship with my addiction Addiction is so complicated. One day I feel like I never want to use again. The next I’m down to do whatever drug that will get me high. Life is so precious and I’m honestly throwing it all away. I was clean for a long time (don’t know exact date) and I got off probation in October. I was already living with my boyfriend for about 4 months. As soon as I got off probation I used. I’m on a pattern on using once a month and I keep hurting my boyfriend more and more. During and after using I already feel regret. I feel terrible and I end up telling him 30 minutes after. After probation I started randomly leaving them coming back. Which obviously hurt him. But the last time I used a brought an old friend (male) into the house. He stayed for roughly an hour. I feel terrible about this. My boyfriend treats me so good and loving him is all I have and want. But me continuously using and going out does not show I love him. He’s also super worried I’m having sex with other people when I haven’t. My using friend and me have always been friends and usually me or them will let them use a little of we have it. I’ve never cheated on him and him thinking I did fucking breaks me. And the devil on my shoulder tells me to use again cause I’ll feel better. My boyfriend is the only person who’s been here for me and helps me through anything and me and my addiction are tearing us apart. I want help and I want to get better. For myself and for him. ,2.1723543233082694,4.161766338815792,3.860075187969926,86.72552631578951,78.04605263157895,6.711278195488722,25.001879699248125,7.7094869923839395,1.3497879699248123,1173,43,239,18,28,392,158,304,0.1,0.7490000000000001,0.151,0.9642,0,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,2,0,3,3,12,22,2,0,12,0,20,10,1,10,6,59,56,28,0,5,4,0,6,1,3,2,5,0,1,2,7,25,0,1,7,1,0,4,5,9,0,1,8,6,52,13,34,45,4,46,1,4,0,4,27,15,1,2,26,164,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26318565945328365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17761015007248804,0.06435503954024517,0.06696082589032606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06622325629947093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756079847478185,0.061879549035129724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1423454506203031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08266897947583256,0.0,0.06932123699432502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051899081273593904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07042335153918107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09332430687883383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712760900290966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20345039605508705,0.057490651340623124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18652206967139465,0.07439692876145441,0.08408870124716752,0.0,0.04573523640974781,0.06749778447976149,0.1287248401114932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078800698907376,0.085025213617463,0.0,0.0,0.07925069306502218,0.09285620695818657,0.1722981917599855,0.0,0.08692574401538276,0.0,0.0,0.07152900077721581,0.0,0.0,0.044226413255220115,0.0655970617451212,0.0,0.08521036079107361,0.0,0.08229013110895902,0.05684117565093527,0.03931553810812526,0.08065610283241614,0.07106002829348318,0.07121696959873339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14526187824035006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12846717965509472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12413304058971004,0.0,0.08558502633997082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08444394000670895,0.08570219801479761,0.054531274247331486,0.061204113582518566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05579054835390014,0.07026680458127724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0863989739653584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0569599209693746,0.08577459100779422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14067566971044854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05156449846758092,0.0,0.0,0.09385008888079874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680032976477126,0.6255333868764799,0.08863075661308935,0.0,0.1898626327437117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817252670346418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Fisheye14,2019/03/03,"I am screwed For last 3 years, I have been spending too much time on my phone and laptop. Eventually, 2019, right now, I spend average 10 hours on my phone and laptop. The majority of time is spent on Youtube. So I deleted Youtube app. although I deleted this app few times and redownloaded it before.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasted my life so much. If I spent this time on something productive, my life would be so much different. I'm regreting in pain everyday, but I don't stop doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

After I deleted Youtube app, I use Safari to watch exact same thing. I watch Youtube untill 2 am every day. I don't do homework at home, but at school before bell ring. I rush big projects one night before due date.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate myself. What should I do? I can't find a way except quitting this life.

But I can't kill myself, just can't.

addiction,burnett-barbie,2019/03/03,"Somewhat of a rant.. You know what I’m tired I hearing? The only thing that will get threw to an addict is giving up on them. 
THATS BULLSHIT! 
When I was using, I had SO MANY family members &amp; close friends cuss me out, end our relationships.. &amp; of course it hurt at first. But not for long, because dope numbs the pain. That’s one of the reasons why we use. When someone you love gives up on you, that makes you want to get high more. Addicts cope with pain with drugs. 
Wanna know what helped me get clean? Having something to do it for. When your an addict, you don’t value your self anymore. When you look down at your arms &amp; see all the Tract marks you lose all respect for your self. 
They tell you in rehab that you have to change for yourself &amp; not for anyone else. But Sometimes doing it for yourself doesn’t seem like enough. I had to have something more. That’s when I held on the the few relationships I had left.. my mom, my dad, my boyfriend. I did it for them. I did it for the life that I wanted to have so badly. Until I learned to love myself again. Now I stay clean for me. But if I didn’t have those few people that still believed in me.. I could still be somewhere with a needle in my arm. 
So don’t give up on your loved ones who are struggling with addiction. I know it’s hard , I’ve loved addicts &amp; Ive been an addict. Being there for them doesn’t mean you have to enable them. Just love them, &amp; tell them you still love them. One day, you could be the reason they got clean.

addiction,mwcope,2019/03/03,"How to help an addict online? Hi,

Someone very dear to me has relapsed, and she says she's seeking help, and I want to make sure she stays on that. The only problem is, we're in two different countries, so I can't help her in person. She says to just be patient and understanding, should I trust her with this? I've only known her for about six months, but she says she's relapsed before. Any advice with this situation?",4.017499999999998,5.115235273809528,4.760476190476194,85.86785714285716,71.26190476190476,7.028571428571429,25.904761904761905,7.1686216300943375,1.0927047619047614,329,10,67,3,6,106,59,84,0.022,0.821,0.157,0.7985,1,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,2,0,5,1,0,2,1,15,8,6,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,1,3,5,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,3,13,3,11,6,0,5,0,0,0,0,17,3,0,0,1,43,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21255905669542124,0.0,0.19053406078259694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13259438151167965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16591523993055438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20371459078413395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3920767823342109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13015193554595572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1556326962145246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965850497174705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17025067851140605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865713500589756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4651723102094231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21916783047174826,0.0,0.0,0.16520753523828938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2078247674009979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18376813780404286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19046898905851736,0.2029830393539219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16088049165735746,0.11500537928684924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,rashidkhan92,2019/03/03,"Ketamine addict in need of some help Hi people 

I know I need to replace my destructive behaviours but I've got a problem. Think to myself I need rehab but I can't just stop what I'm doing as I have also got positive factors playing in my life, I'm just on the path of self destruction at the moment and can't seem to get my focus back, I'm working a job that I was enjoying whilst clean for the short period, stopped smoking weed about 6 months ago but I've replaced that habit with a worse one. Escaping reality even though it's not that bad.....

Seem to be dependant on this substance instead always used drugs as a crutch when times get stressful instead of dealing with things. Spent a disgusting amount of money on ruining myself and it's not actually helping me on my path, I'm currently studying music production and sound engineering on a uni course but I've just lost my way after starting fairly strong again this year...I've been messing up my relationships lost my girlfriend who helped me through things too many times and had enough come the end of it. 

Have family around me that know my problems but I'm done with stressing them out. I've struggled with addiction for years now I'm 26 and have been taking party drugs for over 8 years now for months on end with no breaks at some points in life. The behaviours seem to be hard wired over so long. Only taken 9 months off all drugs replacing them with anti psychotics and anti depressants after a major breakdown that I think was from withdrawing from ketamine, weed and cocaine mainly. Doctors noted it as a drug inched psychosis. 

I've studied so much and read so many articles online, educating myself on ways to get out of this rut but I'm just feeling helpless even though I have a lot of support there for me. 

Don't know what I'm looking to achieve from this but it does feel a bit better letting it out into the world wide web.

addiction,BarelyLaughing,2019/03/03,"becoming addicted I'm 17 years old and a junior high school. Now, I have a lot of time left in my life to not become an addict, and I'm happy about that. My problem is, is that every single of one my family members has been addicted to one drugs or alcohol. I can't tell you a single person in my family line who hasn't been addicted. 

I believe I have the willpower to not drink much and not dabble with drugs, but I still have the underlying feeling that maybe I will slip up and make an addiction from something. Is there any guarantee way to not become addicted to substances/alcohol? Should I even consider trying alcohol?  I'm afraid that I'm just going to become addicted after a couple times getting drunk, or if I try morphine in the hospital because of an injury(football) and I just get hooked. I can go into more detail about my family history, but for the most part everyone who tried something once instantly became addicted.

addiction,cancer4free,2019/03/03,"I need to stop eating out I have a fairly serious problem with getting fast food nearly every day and sometimes multiple times a day. There’s never anything good at home but I know I can get a great meal quickly elsewhere. It takes a toll on my money and my health. Every time I try to cut down I tell myself I’ll just eat out once a week on a Friday night or something but there’s always some dumb circumstance that makes me hit Taco Bell or Chipotle. Like I said, part of the problem is not being satisfied with what I have at home and being too lazy to learn to cook anything good. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

addiction,wfa11,2019/03/03,"How to respond Hi I’m looking for some sort of advice. My ex bf is addicted to meth for about a year and a half, we were together for 7+ years but I unaware of his addiction, we ended Dec of last year because he became completely paranoid due to using, it got unbearably toxic. He would accuse me of being unfaithful and all sorts of manic things. I decided to stop talking to him, hoping it would help him get better but apparently it just got worse. His use got worse. He ended up getting kicked out of his house and had a restraining order issued by his parents and siblings and their property. He spent a week in jail. His parents ended up dropping the charges and he was allowed back home. Right after he got out he reached out to me through social media and crazy as it sounds I could tell the difference in just the way he was writing that he was sober and good. But it didn’t last long. Just the same week he started talking none sense again. He claims he’s alone, I know his siblings can’t stand him and his parents are almost afraid of him, he stopped hanging out with friends since the longest. It was extremely difficult for me to have no contact with him throughout that month, I’ve always tried to help him. It’s the reason why I decided to start talking to him again even though everybody advised me agains it.  But it seems like he doesn’t want help at all. He obviously continues using, his manic thoughts are back again and this time they seem even worse, he will push me away. I’ve tried to reason with him as nicely as possible that he needs to get it together but he will shut me out, he’s convinced he has it under control and doesn’t need help. I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to be there for him and help him if he decided to try and get clean but I feel like while he’s using I can’t keep contact with him, but the idea of not having him in my life scares me.

addiction,steve7150,2019/03/03,"Is it better to burn out early in life than to fade away? Is it better to be a bright shining star in life that accomplishes many goals and does extroidanary things for 30 or 40 or 50 years then dies than to live a dim uneventful slow tedious life into  your 60s,70s,80s and beyond? Would like some opinions.

Let's say drug use, not abuse but just using a bit to help u get more things done, achieve goals and to give energy and a higher quality for a short time on this planet compared to a completely sober life of mundane boring tasks that bring no real joy, lack of energy, eeking through life then one day u die a 90 year old?

addiction,AFewKabooms,2019/03/04,"Ibogaine, common threads of addiction and opiates Hey r/addiction fam,  


I just published an interview with Richie Ogulnick, one of the pioneers of ibogaine therapy with a couple of decades experience in the field. It's longform (2 hours) and covers ibogaine/iboga, commonalities of addiction, the global opiate issue and some philosophical territory.    


The interview is available [here](https://www.cosmictortoise.net/podcast/2019/3/3/ctp-033-richie-olgulnick-pioneering-ibogaine)  


I'm posting in the hope that this may be of benefit to those of us who are suffering from addiction.   


Unsure if self-posting podcasts are against the rules...my apologies if that is the case.

addiction,Aubren17,2019/03/04,"19 y/o addicted to Juuling &amp; I want to stop NOW. Hello, I’m 19 years old and about almost a year ago I started juuling. I never smoked cigarettes before, only like once or twice while drunk and I just always thought smoking was gross. Especially juuling, I used to make fun of people for juuling. One day my friend told me to take a hit of her juul and I wish I never did. I hated it at first, but after a few times of hitting it I got that nicotine buzz, and it felt amazing. Well, it kinda makes me feel like I’m having a panic attack but I like it, as weird as that sounds. It’s Just that nicotine buzz that gets to me. I crave it all the time. Constantly hit it all day and constantly hitting it at work in the bathrooms/wherever I can. I’m hitting it right now lol... I’m scared cause it’s almost been a year that I’ve been smoking it now, and I want to stop SO BADLY. it’s the first thing I grab in the morning and it’s always the best hitting the juul in the morning. I’m sick of craving it. I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s also a lot of money. $21 for a pack of pods and I’m sick of spending the money on them. I go through about a pod a day, sometimes a pod and a half. Is there anything I can try to do to help me slowly get off the juul? It’s not easy. It’s really not. Especially when all my friends around me juul, too. It’s annoying and I wish I never got addicted to this stupid shit. If anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated ",0.03873389355742418,2.0237823682539684,2.820060690943045,91.3456092436975,85.63492063492063,5.610644257703083,20.37581699346405,6.923569853693429,0.3998366013071895,1126,35,254,15,34,395,156,315,0.163,0.693,0.14300000000000002,-0.8982,0,0,2,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,1,4,14,19,5,2,20,1,14,6,1,4,6,44,46,20,0,6,8,0,3,3,2,1,4,1,0,0,28,11,1,2,4,1,3,1,6,10,1,5,9,4,28,9,33,29,6,36,0,0,0,0,7,9,1,6,29,165,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2372839877163796,0.0,0.106348518950836,0.09647222868919318,0.0,0.21795730861456145,0.0,0.0,0.08703221393298527,0.1811124339492259,0.11791848197760255,0.0,0.07400889918080841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10793123541639356,0.07609725531435756,0.0,0.08955874552746039,0.09688277767164033,0.0,0.12381111974345987,0.0,0.0,0.09086944620015604,0.0,0.0,0.09260727433988912,0.0,0.11421155473961267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11179954761527007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23521557331908666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21056122301832125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05502828844707276,0.07774897975930474,0.10449495010924713,0.0,0.0,0.18514340416707506,0.0,0.0,0.16816531942006127,0.0,0.1137195453312356,0.0,0.06185123819245913,0.0,0.17408439033071754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10744820775776814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07294721119675897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05981074190017145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15950817595459554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925243333906744,0.0,0.0,0.14529124637395344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.251811825972062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11419996172035712,0.11590159971056273,0.07374678906636507,0.08277097714408757,0.0,0.1276898800117382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754498012038157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06972000753009835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09294118887277512,0.0,0.0,0.10895894511089008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11171358919181804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10763676863294204,0.0,0.07703123271818378,0.0,0.0,0.1819753926859912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08182746423457353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07230256574256165,0.0,0.0,0.08639975926663705,0.12692061214561787,0.0,0.0,0.10399280688773813,0.0,0.07388919221128287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09399515206370294,0.0,0.0,0.1283828383051257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09785225437977364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25030085298938715,0.0,0.0,0.07923035753034666,0.0,0.0,0.07731051098324886,0.0,0.0,0.2102510352513128

addiction,throwawayyy639,2019/03/04,"(20f) cannot stop drinking. life is slipping between my fingers. I started Uni in September. I got in a lot of trouble for violence/drug/drunk stuff in my halls which meant I had to have compulsory counselling for a while. Everyone said I was an alcoholic and I brushed it off because I knew i wasnt but now I am. I drink every day, I can't keep up with daily tasks, sometimes I don't eat and the withdrawals are troubling. I go to a womens group occassionally, like AA, but it havent found it to be overly helpful. The last few weeks I've been on a very slippery slope and I'm struggling to live a normal life anymore. The Uni I attend is the 2nd best in the world in my field and I feel I'm throwing it all away for drinking. I need my life back before it get's too late, any advice on how to get back to normality would be aprieciated.",2.1543103448275858,3.850074775862069,3.785724137931037,88.58168965517244,77.10344827586206,6.479080459770112,26.54252873563218,7.3011,1.242393563218391,657,26,141,8,15,219,113,174,0.064,0.847,0.08800000000000001,0.5986,0,0,5,0,0,1,19.0,0,0,0,1,5,5,0,1,11,0,16,9,1,1,1,20,30,8,0,4,2,0,2,1,0,1,4,1,0,1,7,5,5,2,4,3,0,3,5,3,1,0,9,4,19,2,23,18,4,26,0,0,0,0,4,13,0,1,11,92,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430249061354289,0.0,0.1564182749942733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09953232976770414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14515345363339655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13751350688473424,0.2250892897264287,0.0,0.08922194830843047,0.0,0.12454472192549923,0.0,0.15359966511396433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09439247314727103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4301420915516849,0.16973541563499808,0.14976659692689234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12331772335081305,0.13985678024114698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07400588054803388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16048023396792582,0.0,0.0,0.15293797654373226,0.0,0.0831818592690141,0.0,0.11706041528516516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09810449771360676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300947746940131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193059441009149,0.16510462003299214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3101430130143814,0.07150590692690965,0.0,0.12924182178056598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12443317715183196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10852682324976076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28681068493832695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13922538829597975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14475743416383885,0.0,0.10359697471770014,0.0,0.0,0.12236660046908487,0.0,0.15301111012405672,0.16755141044128713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12076537456769977,0.0,0.0,0.11740412541627135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397256760832672,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Suspicious_Ambition,2019/03/04,"Relationships removed my post and suggested I post here. My (27f) boyfriend (27m) had a heroin relapse and I'm not sure how to proceed.  

I have recently been dating an ex-heroin addict for the past couple of months (we were friend for a few months before that). He was very open about his past and has been putting in a lot of work to get his life back on track, with a reasonable amount of success. The way I understood his addiction was that this was an issue with one of his long term past partners that kept dragging him in with her (She used heroin as well and has never gotten clean to this day). And that to get away from his addiction he moved really far away from her, his family and everything else. So he has been clean for about a year now.

&amp;#x200B;

Well this past weekend he really wanted me to meet his family and some old friends. It was mostly really sweet and positive. His family was super happy with his progress and really liked me. They all seemed to be really open about everything and things he told me lined up with everyone. But the whole thing kind of came off as him starting a new chapter in his life and how proud everyone was.

&amp;#x200B;

However on the way out of town we made one last stop with some other friend. And when I stopped for gas afterwards he went into the bathroom and i guess shot up or whatever it is heroin addicts do. He obviously seemed really messed up and I tried asking subtly and slowly transitioned to a more direct line of questioning. I stopped to get food and checked his old track marks for a prick mark and found one. He still denied it. We went in and ordered food and while we were waiting I told him to ""go to the bathroom and look in the mirror, then tell me you're not F'ed up."" He came out 5 mins later and confessed everything. Then sometime later he fished out a little baggie of stuff and we tossed it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This seems to be because he was too close to everything back where he used to be, according to him anyways (easy access i guess). I pretty much told him that I still loved him and that I am there for him but..... as a friend or a girlfriend, I'm not sure. I'm just really out of my depth here. I held his hand the whole way back home as he cried and let him stay the night. He has promised that he'll do whatever i say if I don't leave him. Things he had suggested were random drug tests, getting a completely different phone with none of his old numbers, not going back home without me, no more substances of any kind such as alcohol, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should give him the chance again as a girlfriend with a long list of boundaries or step back as a friend. He's generally a really sweet guy, and seems well loved by his family despite his past. (My family would have disowned me for much less). I hate seeing him hurting, but I don't know what is best for me or him.

&amp;#x200B;

r/relationships seems to be pretty heavily against staying in a relationship. But i guess they deleted my post and referred me here. So I guess I am not sure if I would get the same opinion or a different one. I was initially feeling pretty positive about handling it, but now it's starting to get to me.

addiction,salmonhelmet,2019/03/04,"After pretending for a month...I think I am finally ready to get real. I was outed a month ago as an addict and started to go to NA meetings. I haven't ran to my drug of choice for the whole month but would be kidding myself if I said I was working on getting better. So the choices I made were legal ones...I still abused them. In no way  am/was I recreationally partaking. I hit it hard this weekend AND all high tried to tell myself it was ok to slip (back to my DOC) but was 'emergency planned' against and all access to money was taken away. 

&amp;#x200B;

addiction,SwiftSwiftly,2019/03/04,"Over coming nicotine addiction? Hi I just quit nicotine cold turkey today and it’s something I’ve been wanting to do but never got pushed to do it till now. I got addicted to juuls back in September and actually threw it out my car window because I hated how addicting it was. I caved to the cravings later on and bout another one to eventually throw it out too a few months later. I didn’t have anything at the point but I would always bum off my friends pods that they filled with their own salt nics. I eventually got my self a suar air pod to fill with salt nics. I hit it everyday until now when it started leaking and messed up the battery. I threw it away and I want to be done with nicotine for good. I used to smoke cigarettes a year or so back casually buying a pack every so months but I stopped doing that without a problem, it just stopped interesting me or craving it. But these salt nics I feel like I am addicted. I have no means to buy another vape because my girlfriend is taking care of my cards and financials to help me save more. So I really am going to have to buckle down and do this. What advice to you all have to offer? Should I buy some gum to chew when the withdrawals help? And am I going to be easily irritated?

addiction,Transit-Strike,2019/03/04,"Isolating the deep Underlying source of Compulsion: It seems impossible My story with addiction started when I was around Fifteen. I didn't really have anything to look forward to or enjoy in life. Then comes along this brand new shining thing that makes me happy and excited and then releived and stress free. It's been years of uping scales and degree. Up until now, now at 21 it's getting really troubleseome. At this age, I want to be having fun, meeting people, having ambition and chasing goals. But I can hardly even sleeping at night because I dont feel calm enough to sleep without a late night hit.

The days become miserable, I can't wake up on time and I feel the need to blurt, ""I couldn't sleep last night, I was jerking off."" College becomes a chore and apathy sets in. ""Mehh. Fuck it, Let's just browse reddit"".


After weeks on end, I draw my line in the sand and say. ""Enough is enough."" I go a few days with abstaining, they are true bliss. I'm happy, talking to friends. Enjoying, I'm studying. I feel great. Then my mind says, ""Hey you haven't jerked off in a few days. That's cool."" 

My mind's clarity is great, I can now realise some underlying thought patterns and behaviour patterns. I realise that I've never been in a relationship, I dont know what the fuck it is. So I feel awkward around my buds and their girflriends. I feel like a creep for making normal conversations.

But that nigling grows. ""Hey, it's alright to jerk off if you get real stressed"" You know what, You're right Mr Brain. It becomes hard to stay away now, and nothing makes sense anymore. The Clarity is gone, I can't CBT theraputisze myself. The desire to try to leave my pit of misery is gone. All from one time. How is one even meant to be objective with addiction when your mind finds any reason to just relapse.


When you know it's not ""just""one hit, when you know how your mood turns. When you feel pathetic. Yet your brain tries to convince you to just do it. Is it even possible anymore?",2.5906550480769246,5.035196226562505,3.307291666666668,88.88802884615384,78.921875,6.542628205128207,24.68990384615385,7.702957570686157,1.3334644230769226,1557,57,308,25,39,490,209,384,0.084,0.7709999999999999,0.145,0.9762,0,0,0,0,0,0,67.0,0,10,2,1,21,26,5,4,13,2,28,11,6,6,3,61,61,27,0,6,9,0,9,1,2,0,3,2,1,1,19,18,0,1,15,0,1,6,10,9,0,2,9,14,38,17,46,46,7,62,0,1,2,2,23,23,2,4,34,192,57,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17472679679763578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449730516092966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589528161610224,0.0,0.0,0.06594761358247161,0.1426814979833946,0.0,0.0,0.07529327974073631,0.0,0.0,0.04885202381342173,0.2655218685447877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17892337684856072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06903269947474942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15504918128634532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18784475011289195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709794157758122,0.24841519752564495,0.0,0.15879326910909428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24312428325604185,0.057251356563786285,0.0,0.0,0.07324564399265605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061915234730965926,0.1481745291260243,0.08373869674156156,0.0,0.04554487149066893,0.0,0.0,0.17670718105469194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1706190274388387,0.14357770387627375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761693141940686,0.06532402545338661,0.09040034411348494,0.08485568757387738,0.0,0.08194761283685037,0.05660458420301541,0.03915189405994667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06729662226270512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16048032355221958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.242752799975412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059422093490547175,0.06180817926415425,0.07739879823639041,0.0,0.2256152217042576,0.07851925830018576,0.07689558417709115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10860859471966296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555832995827175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034474286050104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09121578871902343,0.10267826081043407,0.08239629519034837,0.0,0.0860393533538006,0.0,0.06843831469030505,0.0,0.12745958540565835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295558542536403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405907899693418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05672283526484409,0.08541756928104652,0.0,0.0,0.1835980323890369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06441273641217156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05324082688440172,0.0,0.0,0.06362145767202244,0.09345945430715673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10881831511086892,0.08716827881223672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047268090688984486,0.0,0.06428271562511605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07725118879136242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05160692365071429
addiction,sophmmorgan,2019/03/04,"A smooth sea never made a good sailor ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I need help. We recently got an insomnia cookie joint in my town and I can’t stop eating cookies. It is starting to become a financial drain, it is affecting my relationships as well. I keep choosing chocolate chunks and snickerdoodles over my s/o and friends. I can’t share anymore. I’ve even turned to violence. It’s even affecting my school work and it’s taking a toll on my emotional and mental health. I hope this doesn’t eventually lead to a run in with the law or a serious crime because the need for cookies is rushing through my veins and nothing can stop the force. I don’t really know god but if I did I think my relationship with him would be compromised over this. It hasn’t affected my physical health yet because I’m pretty active, but if I keep on like this I’m gonna be the next guest for “my 600 lb. life” on TLC. I don’t know how it got this far, this is why I usually stick to the salty stuff. Sugar is too hard core for me. I know smokers use vapes and patches to quit, is there some equivalent for the cookie addict? Any suggestions are appreciated. What would Cookie Monster do?

addiction,SVgesus,2019/03/04,"Crazy Idea To Moderate My Porn Cravings I have been actively battling my porn addiction for about 2 years now. I also have a hard time not being lazy and procrastiating. Would it be a good idea at all to use PMO as an incentive to complete my goals? 

On one hand, I could moderate my porn craving and get work done at the same time, it would also be distracting myself from the craving with the work. However on the other hand, it might backfire big time and I could relapse super hard. I would also have to be okay with watching porn occasioally.

I had to drop out of nursing school &amp; got fired from my job due to a felony possession of a controlled substance &amp; misdemeanor drug paraphernalia charge. I am heartbroken and I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life. The only good thing that has come out of this is that I have officially been clean for 8 weeks. I haven’t been clean for this long since I started using. Taking things one day at a time and hoping for the best has become a way of life for me and I am truly thankful that this horrible situation has given be the gift of sobriety. ,3.3074106280193227,4.789524069565218,4.476811594202901,85.72468599033819,73.52173913043478,7.893719806763285,24.082125603864736,8.515128840125781,1.400835748792271,448,13,94,8,9,147,74,115,0.133,0.6729999999999999,0.194,0.7783,1,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,2,0,4,0,0,7,0,14,3,0,2,0,11,25,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,9,7,0,1,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,5,1,10,4,17,19,1,14,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,7,62,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3991483830710785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2034278724451979,0.0,0.0,0.1933003064397031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15866687659583373,0.0,0.0,0.20658930526733926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11878993337277866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2136066366523128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10468173140217917,0.15449324196882466,0.14731681953728526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18294626657060375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827841870443117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122824055803882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2602034295293195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16300595051090225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12481466483818272,0.14008788587759707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18641422655706688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15236723326197116,0.2070418455172607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13037350663687766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13849101299591107,0.0,0.0,0.16958114700315566,0.0,0.0,0.2447407032725828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10740504004693946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15908453167618514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620467458293138,0.2954987356699304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,bpo35,2019/03/05,"Can someone help me quit JUUL? Can't seem to do it Just going to jump right it. I can't seem to quit JUULing. My buddy gave me his JUUL 3 weeks ago, and I created this horrible addiction to it already. Luckily, I haven't been doing it for long. However, I have struggled with addition in my past. This took the form of smoking weed/tobacco bowls every day, and drinking 4-5 times a week. I am proud to say that I am a month clean from Weed/Alcohol/Cigarettes, but now I have this new addiction to the JUUL. I started off killing a pod every three days, and now I am going through a pod a day. I have tried to quit multiple times this past week, but I continue to succumb to the addiction and buy more pods. I just bought another 4 pack 30 minutes ago, and I feel terrible for it. Any advice or words of encouragement? Trying to get my life back on track. I am happy that I am free from the other substances, but this one is tough to kick. It feels bad when you know you are on a path of self destruction.

addiction,RealPierceHawthorne,2019/03/05,"Y’all were right In April of 2017, I posted to r/addiction asking for your help.  One of my best friends and coworkers was struggling with an addiction to heroin and I was considering letting him live with me for a few months.  The replies I got were supportive but all advised me to be wary.  He had a good six months at my place before he started slipping again. He never stole from me, but he brought dope into my house and that was inexcusable.

It was tough but I had to kick him out.  He had a couple of rocky months, but managed to get into a halfway house and had another good six months, followed by an epic spiral. 

Now he is jobless, nearly homeless and without insurance.  Are there any programs where he can live a sober clean lifestyle on a ranch or a farm in exchange for hard work?

I realize this is probably a hard bill to fit, but I need your help.  All my google searches seem to lead to crazy expensive facilities",4.594743589743589,5.908399277777782,5.018888888888891,83.74115384615386,70.1111111111111,8.205128205128206,30.512820512820515,8.617729084823388,2.2939102564102565,730,30,143,12,13,232,113,180,0.064,0.797,0.139,0.9442,2,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,3,0,3,4,7,0,1,11,0,16,1,0,1,3,24,25,11,0,1,7,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,10,0,0,2,0,3,3,2,2,0,3,12,2,18,5,27,11,4,25,0,0,0,0,17,12,0,2,9,98,21,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3085633400179155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962409361965684,0.1483998884630904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13230551003400334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12042620387190607,0.0,0.1485203411248182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156593228763263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093408222249204,0.0,0.07394026683053459,0.0,0.0,0.2374066489733824,0.11318939268172268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2535547876578809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18972064106380876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32659858542367154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14471752236561175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2499359545374103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.451851314232726,0.0,0.0,0.10493799448252786,0.1091517648335413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590008904062046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14786209423390162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13554053756071674,0.0,0.15258643302776714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12086042526433725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12883781723466745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10017116907876103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14795124881718238,0.0,0.0,0.16059936279759046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13642374993816564,0.0,0.1030309039630564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,the4thtime,2019/03/05,"Boyfriend is currently clean from a coke relapse. How do you prevent another one? (On mobile so I apologize for formatting)
I’ve known since before I started dating my boyfriend that he had a coke addiction. He was clean for about a month before we started dating. He recently admitted to me that he’s had a few relapses. Each time was for about a month straight in the winter. He’s currently been clean for about 3 weeks.
He’s aware that he has a problem, and he feels horribly about relapsing without telling me. I told him relapsing is a part of recovery, and that he’s sick, it’s not his fault. But that he has to tell me when it happens and if he really doesn’t want to do it anymore we need a new game plan. 
So what should the game plan be? As far as patterns go, we’re aware that it happens due to his seasonal depression and he uses it as a coping method. I think therapy would be great for him but he doesn’t think he has the money to do it. Can he recover without it if he now has a support system to help him? I use to go to DBT so I have old binders he can look through? We have a system where he rates his cravings for it each day. Is this beneficial or might it pressure him to lie again?
I’m aware I can’t fix him and that it has to be his own doing. But he’s made it 11 months clean on his own, it’s just figuring out that one for next time. 
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

addiction,hopeless_alcoholic1,2019/03/06,"Why can't I stop drinking? I told myself this morning I wouldn't drink today, and yet here I am 6 drinks in... I feel as though I cannot cope without the help of alcohol. I'm a 7+ drink a day user as of now, and every time I try and cut back I fail. It's become a coping mechanism for me now. I don't feel like I can face the day without a few drinks. Of course, it never ends with just a few. And at this point, I'm afraid to quit cold turkey for fear of the withdrawal symptoms. 

For the record, I'm an ex-heroin addiction; clean of that for over 6 years. As you might have guessed, I slowly replaced my heroin addiction for alcohol. I'm incredibly proud to have quit smack, but am slowly coming to the realization that I'm equally as addicted to alcohol. I need help, but I don't know where to turn. I used NA to quit drugs, but feel apprehensive to go back to a meeting as I can't even make it past day 1 with alcohol. I certainly don't want to show up to meeting halfway into my cup. 

How have other alcoholics here on reddit dealt with this inability to get past even the first day? I know I am capable of conquering this addiction. I did it before with heroin; but, for some reason, this feels so much more difficult. I wake up and feel unable to face the world without a bit of alcohol. I don't know what to do anymore.

addiction,Brahne666,2019/03/06,"My Doctor once told me... I went to a suboxone doctor a few years ago to get off of opiates. My doctor told me that the part of my brain that tells me to use when I'm sick is the same part of the brain that activates in a wild cat (Lions, Tigers, etc.) when they need to eat. Basically, not using triggers a sort of life or death scenario in us addicts. Anyone ever hear of this or have any thoughts on it? The statement stuck with me and I wonder if any of you have some more information on it...

addiction,LissomCLWN,2019/03/06,"Sibling addicted to drugs and I have no idea what to do.   I'm going to go ahead and get this out of the way but I don't care if I shoot myself in the foot because of this post and the comments I receive, perhaps I deserve it 

  I, myself, take opioid of which i dont have a script.

  Percocet 7.5-10 mg. Hydrocodone 5-10mg a day - though not every day, or on the same day, maybe 2-3 times a week depending how the workdays go.

  I smoke weed but a gram will last me a week (mid, not the strong stuff) when I can't find anything.

  I can take 1-2 Perocert 10s a day and be ok or 5 Hydros a day but I NEVER steal to support my habit, that's why I have a job.

  I wanted to get that out of the way so that I'm not seen as some holier than thou looking down on my brother as to an extent I believe myself to have a problem only I can reign my problem in a bit better.



  My brother has a scrip of Xanax 90-120 ct, he buys Morphine 8mg to 60mg from a friend, Percocet when he can get them. He doesn't deal with hard drugs - LSD, Cocaine, Methamphetamine etc.

  My problem with him is his Xanax. He says it's to calm him down, drowns the voices in his head. It's not so much that I believe he has a full blown headcase going on but he's committed some atrocities back in his day (he's 34) and he has trouble reconciling those.

  When he gets fucked up in his Xanax, his short-long term memory goes to shit. It's remeniscient of someone being on Ambien or some other sleep aid and they do or say stupid stuff. He wakes up, looks around and he can't find his Xanax. When he does, he always has some missing. No matter what I tell him (I don't take them anyways, I don't like how they feel) he ALWAYS accuses someone of stealing them even after I tell him after how many I told him he's taken. Last night around 12 I got up to take a piss. On the counter I find approximately 6-8 2mg (blue) Xanax semi-crushed up on the counter sitting there along with 2 2mg Xanax wholes. I scoop it up and hide them in my room, sitting there waiting on what to do. Mind you we have years 8-15 living in this house, of which I'm sure will draw some ire of you folks.

Well, last night was the final straw for me. I have to get up at 6 in the morning, get kids up for school and bus stop and head to work myself because hes stoned out of his gourd and Mom/Dad are out of town do to Cancer treatment for her. But because I was up till 4 putting up with bullshit in his drunken stupor , i got no sleep whatsoever and was not able to get to work, which my boss was not happy about (didn't give full details)

He has lost friends, family, done bad things in the past. We've tried rehab but it's too damn expensive. We've tried therapists who are also expensive but they just piss him off and he's scared to reveal what he's done in his past.

I'm at my wits end. I've went to family and friends and whatever and...i have no idea whatever so I can do to help him. I've never been in his position as far as having to deal with demons as dark as his, and on more than once occasion he has contemplated suicide, of which I believe he is serious. 

If you can't help, that's fine. I don't blame you. It's not your family and we're all just strangers to you. I'm a 32 years old man who's being tearing apart on the inside because I have no idea how to help my brother. So...anything....everything You can think of.. .please....please help me.",1.950988897622324,3.005088540577721,3.561618932992733,92.65014700825311,76.24896836313617,6.678414226763609,23.160959913539013,7.0958314945682925,0.5502222637060328,2607,74,619,27,56,868,306,727,0.162,0.7609999999999999,0.077,-0.997,1,0,6,1,0,1,101.0,1,8,7,6,25,31,6,1,30,1,52,21,9,6,5,87,90,50,2,6,22,3,2,1,3,2,11,3,1,2,30,30,0,2,10,0,3,7,24,17,1,0,15,9,83,14,100,70,16,94,1,2,4,1,80,48,5,12,35,373,113,5,0.06565550024497982,0.0,0.0,0.07157418638284738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05250467982523147,0.10926127151257582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0540288824904468,0.11689462998483276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0504850270162202,0.05481960027248082,0.16009193422807402,0.0,0.0,0.22191379691785945,0.0,0.05806695452905038,0.07167880164203992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06694015820947005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2540541966839727,0.13537587565846565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05745557070899032,0.13437674370683125,0.07694775731046563,0.0,0.1522790720848076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05815128563213425,0.0,0.07322323802084596,0.043364838700039016,0.0,0.05531759065490161,0.0,0.05900693012909317,0.0,0.18568248732324613,0.0,0.033197393650915896,0.0,0.0,0.07192239130287705,0.18002381332270792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521758298712838,0.060697452017847625,0.2401160233301348,0.06298273842899026,0.14925413528327572,0.0,0.10502140258000243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06989150086984729,0.05881443216499655,0.0,0.13476296972725713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17602999142264816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07575763220650558,0.0,0.2223512044848772,0.0,0.0,0.0651529531832604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16055398686763392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03207596103228095,0.0,0.05797500958084269,0.05810305165870301,0.11026816889101483,0.0,0.07167073430306566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06656437221016481,0.0659597746951093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06629333896819238,0.07689492837192073,0.0,0.0,0.04826434709874074,0.0,0.10127513864426037,0.0,0.0,0.12322647870870422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06889440306319199,0.06992096499717873,0.0,0.04993396648645732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253512081170755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07207002329229686,0.0,0.0,0.0628798203781357,0.0,0.0,0.18847034029637136,0.0,0.0660019119170536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10442377802725776,0.0657326094398484,0.06644687142778878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06739442750658123,0.0,0.0,0.1314058317241099,0.0,0.11125938459484014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05489093806349531,0.0,0.0,0.1503196796793836,0.0718164609491105,0.07450508362512455,0.0618795319799642,0.0,0.1974590610256119,0.0,0.11477160219485393,0.0,0.0,0.07623109618166088,0.04361859699190275,0.04206939350407648,0.0645061956395103,0.0,0.03828425018039451,0.0,0.0,0.06273664408872896,0.0,0.0891515498522335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03872531511984413,0.10422856016495864,0.1053297640355961,0.0,0.05903217962883426,0.060863306501405985,0.059243876911297726,0.07330202133043376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09559597226315847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455997911527165
addiction,muffinlover22,2019/03/06,"Ideas about coping with triggers/cravings for people who are struggling Triggers are tricky and the way that you engage with them can be a concern. The sensitivity you have to cues that trigger euphoric memories can be potentially dangerous for someone who wants to maintain continued abstinence. The problem is that these cues trigger emotional memories that mobilize your thoughts and produce physiological symptoms (bodily sensations) that can be distressing and problematic. There are ways to get through them. One of the worst things you can do is try to suppress them, so stay away from that. 

In aa, they have an acronym called HALT. This stands for hungry angry lonely tired. When your having cravings, think about halt. The idea is that if you’re having cravings, there is an underlying emotional response that is driving the thoughts. This a way to detach from the thought and merely observe it as it dissipates through conscious thought. Halt is a form of mindfulness, which is another interesting way to deal with cravings. Look up mindfulness based craving strategies online to see if any work for you. 

Another acronym is SOBER. STOP OBSERVE BREATHE EXPAND RESPOND. I found an excerpt about this on a website that I copied below:

“The first step is to STOP whatever it is that you happen to be doing - so if you are becoming stressed because of an argument with your spouse, you need to at least temporarily disengage from the conversation. The next step is to OBSERVE what is happening in your body and mind - you need to observe for signs that your body is entering the 'fight or flight' response or that your thoughts are starting to race (these are signs that you are now starting to act on impulse rather than rational thought). The next thing you need to do is to BREATHE because this is going to slow down your thinking and move your body out of the state of high alertness. You next need to EXPAND your awareness so you can look at the situation in a more objective way (i.e. see the bigger picture). Now that you are in the right state of mind, you will be able to RESPOND mindfully.”

Another thing to look up is transformational breaching exercises. Cravings distract you and become intrusive thoughts, which can lead to a negative outcome if the wrong coping strategies is not used. Mindfulness gives you a way to detach from the cravings, observe them, and see them leave your thoughts. The most important thing to remember is that cravings are transient, temporary thoughts that will leave if you are prepared with strategies to manage them. You can always call some one as well to disrupt your thoughts. Look up mindfulness and see if anything works for you because not only is it good for cravings, it’s always effective for life after putting drugs down. 

Feel free to add ideas on here to help people develop a solid resource for coping with urges and cravings. I keep seeing people struggling on this sub and want to help.

addiction,BombjourMolasses,2019/03/06,"My friend has a crippling addiction to Minecraft Help me. My dearest friend has been addicted to Minecraft for years now.

At first, it was a harmless pastime- he'd spend his free time playing Minecraft with his friends, me included. He enjoyed the game thoroughly, and would always bring it up in conversations. I believed it was just a normal obession of sorts, and that it was a phase, that he would grow out of it within a year or two.

It's been five years, and his addiction to Minecraft has only escalated exponentially. He's now a full-time Minecraft server moderator, and he's overly defensive about it; my friend has rejected everyone out of his life, only interacting occasionally with his parents whenever he goes outside of his room. He spends all day on his Discord and Minecraft server, and refuses to reply to anyone of us. His grades have deteriorated significantly, and he is no longer the person I used to remember.

He spends at least a few hundred dollars per week on his Minecraft habit, where he receives the money from, I don't know. It might be illegal, his parents claim he sneaks out of the house at night for hours at a time.

His parents have already talked to him about counseling, but he throws tantrums whenever his Minecraft is interfered with in any way. They now refuse to get any help whatsoever for their son.

Please Reddit, I need your help. He has nothing left in his life but Minecraft.

addiction,tuvo,2019/03/06,"Quite literally addicted to everything. Advice? As the title suggest I'm an insane dopamine addict, although I consider myself to be pretty intelligent with a decent career and a good work ethic, I'm spiraling out of control in life. To name my major addictions presently:

* Gambling Addiction (This one is pretty bad)
* Porn &amp; Masturbation Addict (Even though I have a SO)
* E-cig Addict (Ex-smoker turned 24/7 vaper, it literally never leaves my hands)

And then we have caffeine (numerous coffee's per day mainly), social media &amp; you tube procrastination (speaks for itself), and to top it off I will turn to alcohol when I'm stressed (I drink maybe 2-3 nights per week, this usually triggers my gambling). 

&amp;#x200B;

So yea I'ts really hit me hard now that I've gone and read it and I actually feel physically sick. How do I go about developing a plan to tackle these present addictions? Start from the most severe and move my way down? (E.g. cold turkey on gambling and Porn for x time etc?). I would consider myself to have an extreme addictive personality disorder.

addiction,buildpat1,2019/03/06,"Is drug use related to fear of happiness? Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for being this annoying person posting about surveys. I truly understand it is annoying.

But I am also truly passionate in the field of addiction and work within the addiction services. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am doing my dissertation on drug use and its relevance with fear of happiness and self-regard. I hope my findings will help me and other counsellors understand the positive emotions around addiction and utilise this to better my practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have 10 minutes to spare, please fill in the survey in this link:

addiction,rawpowerofmind,2019/03/06,"Addiction to anything My story is definitely not as hardcore and difficult as most of you guys with heavy drug addictions but even if you don't read it, it's fine, I just want to get this off my chest right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a substance that I am addicted to per se, but I feel like I have a serious addictive personality. Always have had. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being a kid, I was always looking to do something illegal just for the thrill of it. Then after I did some heavy drinking, smoking, lots of drugs including weed, spice, coke, MDMA and did everything that even remotely gave me some adrenaline. But all that was okay at the time because I felt like I was living life to the fullest. But this has to stop eventually, right? RIGHT?! After every stimulating night, the next day I always felt withdrawals no matter what it was. Even when it was just climbing sober to secured areas and then running away from security and its dogs, the next day I felt like I desperately needed more of whatever that was. 

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward to present. I am in my mid 20s and have gotten very many responsibilities that I can't escape from. And for that I have been trying to be a good boy for about 2 years now without any drugs and (many) alcohol, even quit smoking. Everything seems fine - however it doesn't feel like it. I have noticed that my addictions have just been replaced by other activities. I still engage in adrenaline inducing activities every week that have now become more extreme than ever, often involving cops. I was incredibly lazy when I was a child but now I work 14h a day and I can't stop. I masturbate in every few hours every day (6-8 times per day). When I even take a sip of light alcohol then it instantly leads to heavy drinking of liqour and that snowballs into even more crazy activities. Don't get me started on caffeine, I need to stay even farther away from that. One cup leads to ringing up my old coke dealer, luckily my rational part of brain interrupts every time. I just love stimulants too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I can't stop myself abusing whatever object or activity is currently the closest available, so I just try to channel these into the least harmful stuff I can find like masturbating, internet entertaining stuff and programming, even though concentrating on something is requiring every last bit of my body molecule power. Sure, I now have lots of seemingly unbelievable stories to tell about my past life but I feel like this infinitely deathly hungry speeding train can go off tracks any time again soon and lead to substances again and I don't think I can stop it then. Whatever the beast in my brain is, that is constantly seeking to devour anything that tingles my dopamine receptors, I know is not life sustainable at all and I'd like to tame it even a little bit. Just to get some rest and chill out for a change. My brain wires and nerves can not loosen even on a vacation.",6.510615224191866,7.416890416058397,6.752052137643383,74.54081021897812,65.45985401459853,10.277455683003133,33.722836287799794,10.290406445055957,3.5397538477580817,2340,99,417,55,35,754,268,548,0.069,0.795,0.136,0.9904,3,0,9,0,0,0,72.0,0,2,0,8,37,21,0,0,18,1,46,24,5,6,4,76,70,35,1,4,19,0,7,7,0,0,14,1,0,5,31,19,6,7,13,5,0,7,13,3,0,2,18,11,50,18,61,50,18,81,0,0,1,1,11,26,0,11,56,290,81,7,0.0,0.06344459150454514,0.0,0.2918713710774054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11445119187291965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13366650213020906,0.2320731666145605,0.2602624899373544,0.07282776754966311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08812944893800907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006185802915867,0.0,0.0,0.032641832693455275,0.059138596745377525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691919207040401,0.05947878873056794,0.0,0.17932891442772214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05664576214578978,0.0,0.0,0.057865423237457435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17266734107528772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10491160118514124,0.18629300786479866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3536737353947521,0.048436443606029486,0.27069459275916946,0.0,0.09624941320450364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10830014887502754,0.11476223848366104,0.15424092279925394,0.0,0.048941105610363515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392849412274697,0.0,0.03043206727568336,0.044912791088358224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05302007615272482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052733135593571685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029428101595166862,0.04364805678995487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134657618870108,0.18312295643929544,0.053668290365880236,0.04728309573531224,0.0,0.04496610198020814,0.0,0.0,0.09104770803848032,0.048328374336994426,0.0,0.0,0.10857676804297414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03936330085965509,0.07940903498374187,0.0,0.0,0.11389595785773644,0.05025035297134647,0.0,0.0,0.0609637610158814,0.056188704050521086,0.0,0.036284920267075145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057986322331401816,0.05111679339760946,0.0,0.04675528743542175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05695396269630095,0.05356161938637852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13718686618644554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09749458989060523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244639161073031,0.0,0.0,0.03790093335098984,0.05707411459968035,0.04276280620765234,0.1790711893432769,0.0,0.0,0.1225973028132176,0.0,0.0,0.050467535164181926,0.0,0.040260776814791684,0.0,0.046802550732718384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03431083797935368,0.05260978214571279,0.0,0.1248950456082306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727099710218512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04418198914659701,0.03158348390850079,0.0,0.042952276788572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05161752130329108,0.0,0.03898294748986805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2602624899373544,0.0344825953181436
addiction,SadElvenMermaid,2019/03/06,"Can there be healthy addictions? ive recently found myself kindof addicted to pop/soda--something rather benign i know--but i used to smoke the green stuff and had what i believe was a social emotional addiction to it, as well as vaping and social smoking tobacco and hookah (too much hookah), for what its worth.    


i didnt really understand how people  could drink cases of pop in a day, similar to packs of cigs in a day, but now i get it.  but the feeling of addiction is well, kindof pleasurable, like guilty pleasure.    


so i thought, well maybe there's something i could get addicted to that would still give me the same feeling, of sorts, while being healthy and productive.  maybe its not possible because part of what gives me the thrill is doing something that i know others frown on, or that is dangerous.   a stick it to the man sort of feeling.  so maybe nothing healthy can replace that, because healthy things aren't usually seen as wrong, so part of me is like, well whats the point trying to get addicted to something like that if it doesnt give me that guilty pleasure.    


but i figured id ask anyway ",5.739857142857144,6.782088414285719,5.768571428571431,80.42142857142859,67.23809523809524,9.428571428571429,32.61904761904762,9.606745405546679,3.054190476190477,877,37,162,18,14,276,115,210,0.064,0.691,0.246,0.9889,0,0,7,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,0,15,14,1,0,10,0,18,7,0,2,0,29,34,17,0,5,7,0,3,3,0,1,6,0,0,1,19,4,1,0,8,1,1,0,4,2,4,0,6,5,15,12,22,23,4,11,0,0,2,0,7,4,0,6,10,113,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5861776502469178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08378024101626289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10925996108817998,0.0,0.0,0.10096820485506476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14310452200313944,0.0,0.0,0.11559171413110035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08779100710149051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008075964239254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13593986315490467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09826093495596094,0.0,0.0,0.14046429451676404,0.25790774219173906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09850284036997753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13134771359287195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2700983950748832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587915514147218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08599038360344825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19409398305156791,0.0,0.06212947279880415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08471748015681375,0.10103023701904412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05741124883380875,0.0,0.08848644435500673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827074585422756,0.0,0.27596764017038106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07156863075286625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10259056729965474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05953786782620514,0.0,0.0,0.07114626423837787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084438241547476,0.0,0.0,0.0932949512935861,0.0,0.0774007240600384,0.09870098689835548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3223074881465614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06366168250357823,0.09798263977842056,0.0,0.0

addiction,boosterpackpack,2019/03/07,"Should I loan my ” sober “ father money? My dad who has an addiction problem and stated he is sober has recently started asking me for money. I believe his drug of choice was percocets. He lives about two hours away so I don’t know his day to day life style. Last time I saw him he was missing a full set of teeth. He asked me for $80 in December for rent, and again $60 in February. He’s only paid me back for the $60 and today he is asking for $40 “until tomorrow”. Now those are weird amounts to be short on cash... I want to trust him because he is my dad and I feel bad. But I’ve also bought my share of drugs, and this just doesn’t seem right.

addiction,SwimHasAProblem,2019/03/07,"Addicted becouse of not able to feel free. Im addicted to nicotine, I know it's like nothing to some people, but I feel like it gives me anxiety in social sitoations, i cant feel as active as i was used to when i wasnt addicted and i hate it. I associate my addiction to not being completly free. I feel like, at the moment i live 2 different lives. One is being in school and with friends where i hate my addiction because of anexiety it gives me, and i completly dont need any stimulants when im living this side of my life, and the other one is where i spend the most of the time. Its being alone. I hate it, its borring af that is when my addiction helps me alot. I also assosiate my addiction to not being free, as i said i still got school. And i lived in my small town for whole my life. I imagine if i was free from school and everything i could just go to live anywhere else where i could just explore to fill the boredom. Now Im locked here and nothing thills me. Does any of you ever felt like this? Did becoming free helped you, or is it just my imagination?

Also as I live the first side of my life(the one that im with friends and shit) i take no stimulants (nicotine) at all and it helps me to be abit more active, but every little thing triggers me alot when im in this state, sometimes i do really shitty impulsive stuff that I dont want to do and it gets me in trouble. I wish i could quit my addiction to nicotine and feel good. I usually get really depressed when im borred.",2.300560119492157,3.9160789676375423,4.052766990291263,87.17405713218824,76.47572815533981,7.99009210853871,25.476848394324122,8.730908602173464,1.7843407020164297,1167,42,251,25,26,393,137,309,0.092,0.7120000000000001,0.196,0.99,1,1,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,2,0,2,17,18,4,0,8,0,21,11,1,4,2,49,43,26,0,7,10,0,6,4,2,0,10,1,0,0,19,13,0,0,10,0,6,3,8,6,0,4,7,7,47,17,32,28,7,31,0,1,0,0,11,15,1,6,16,172,66,3,0.06319859090728322,0.0,0.0,0.551166340410553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545468048216907,0.0,0.1010797806310648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595441797795603,0.0,0.04834674906192148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03852527442896666,0.06979787839597842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13252504032555434,0.0,0.0,0.15137679696995987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05443285374264063,0.0,0.0,0.06602907636371201,0.0,0.0,0.055305512790752166,0.0,0.1481365557295823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0527943132369741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057166743663250086,0.05324753857226139,0.0,0.0567988184388001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15977553233955405,0.09029817194367737,0.06068055813350755,0.0,0.0,0.05375668914071998,0.0,0.0,0.09765414912816801,0.0,0.06603731064681789,0.12125169423253412,0.035917215624708045,0.05300797961619269,0.05054568644970586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18718657342876133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1270820499480904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40959193867508775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03473229277670516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391710128657475,0.12350255693266657,0.0633415909546512,0.33483308173794524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04686095437131283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12128150490192136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284750023734901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043813945490410566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06721948069821636,0.0,0.0,0.08097327125522656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060116332284522137,0.0,0.0,0.19188104402973125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06487244537817155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442300464375414,0.0,0.0,0.06250502239108828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05047047633550432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07234726645843817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04751747520059487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04198633559953258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0368516065876421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05458329118398871,0.0696043192547018,0.0,0.037276166336144716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055896979618627,0.07267526059780835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,veefroggy,2019/03/07,"Sister is going through addiction. How else can I help her? My sister (29, F) just got her second DUI. Her first one was 3 years ago and we thought that was her moment of realization to stop drinking and taking xanax at the same time. But this time, she got a slew of tickets. She refused a breathalyzer, and was drunk driving while on xanax, and a bunch of other things I don’t remember. I just want her to get better. I’m currently getting my degree to be a therapist so I have learned a lot about this topic. 

Addiction also runs in my family, my uncle passed away from a heroin overdose years ago. My father was a heavy drinker but has gotten somewhat better. I dabbled a little bit in cocaine and alcohol not too long ago, and so did my sister. I was able to snap out of it, with the help from my boyfriend, before it became a huge problem. 

I have been trying to just be there for her. Giving her as much love as I can, and letting her know I will do anything to help her. Tonight my mom, my cousin and I are going to an al-anon meeting for the first time. I plan on asking a lot of questions. 

When i talk to her, I feel like i’m repeating myself because I don’t know what else to say. I tell her things like “healing isn’t linear, and that there will be some days where she doesn’t feel as good, and that’s okay.” I’ve also been letting her know that I will be there to help her heal. I guess my question is, am I saying enough? Am i saying the right things? What can i do to get her to come to meeting eventually without forcing her? That’s the last thing I would ever do because i don’t want to smother her. I just care so much. Any advice at this point is good advice. Or if anyone can relate... My whole family is a mess, we just want to help her any way we can. But i know she has to want it too.

I then vowed to quit drugs once and for all however I relapsed again. I almost died again in 2012 however I survived. I haven't taken cocaine since that day.

addiction,trashit15,2019/03/07,"3 Days clean opiates New to reddit here but just reading some threads has made me want to share mine. 

Just a little back story.

I was introduced to opiates by my sister who sold it at the age of 18. Completely fell head over heals of not being able to feel. (Father was/is an abusive alcoholic that I’ve obviously dealt with a lot of trauma from.)  After months and months of being on opiates my mother eventuality found out and sent me to rehab. By this time I was using a needle and pretty much tried every other drug there was to try. 
Completed 3 months of rehab and within a week I was back to my same old ways. 

Just a little weird thing about me is that I HAVE to have control in every aspect so I would never do enough to nod out. I always knew my limit. Just enough to get that buzz. If I’m not in control of my surroundings or myself I panic. I guess in a lot of ways that saved me. But in retrospect as I thought I was in control I was most definitely not. 

I feel like I’m not like other addicts, as yes I would do it everyday but I would only do enough to keep me a little numb. 

For 3 years now i have been doing 10-20mg opiate everyday, spacing them out. I don’t even want to think about how much money I’ve spent. I feel silly for even writing this because I read someone else’s post and think why should i complain I’m not anywhere near as bad. It should be easy for me to quit. Well I’m learning it’s not easy.. the psychological cravings and also the physical withdrawal is almost debilitating. 

Had to completely cut off my sister and the friends I associated with. 

I know I can do this and I know I can take back control of my life. 

Any encouraging words would be greatly appreciated right now!

addiction,xxtanj,2019/03/07,"Today I'm telling my sister I know about her meth addiction, advice/what to expect? Last Saturday, a close friend of my sister's sent me a text telling me that my sister has been doing meth for over two years, and regularly smoking it for the last 2 months. 

Today, I'm going over to her house to tell her that I know about her drug use, and to give her the option to tell our mother herself. 

She currently rents a house from my parents (we have different dads), however I have reason to believe she lies to them about how many people live there to cover her portion of rent and then some. She's unemployed, but somehow manages to buy tickets to weekend-long music festivals and apparently, enough meth to smoke every day. 

I want to be supportive, but I have a feeling I know what she's going to say already - at least, this is what I'm afraid of: 
""Please dont tell mom, give me time, I'm quitting...if you tell mom, she'll kick me out of this house and I will be homeless, and it will be your fault..."" etc.

I feel so ill prepared to do this. Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated.

addiction,catsandpizzarollz,2019/03/07,"6 months clean today and pregnant It might not seem like a long time to other people, but I know for those in addiction it's a lifetime of pride; each day is an accomplishment in itself. I never thought I would see this day, it's crazy how addiction controls every minute of your life to the point you can't even imagine going one full hour without using. I remember being in treatment and just counting down the days to get my orange 30 day keytag. It was a feeling of pride I never felt before and was so proud of myself. It does get easier each day, but it also gets harder. I have to put myself in check everyday and make sure I'm still clean for the right reasons and I still have to build myself up everyday that I do have the strength to continue. 

I'm also 9 months pregnant, I know, that doesn't seem to add up. When I found out I was pregnant I tried quitting by myself and detoxing at home but quickly realized that wasnt something a strip could fix--I had a real problem and it was addiction. That was a very heavy and hard realization to admit. I admitted myself to treatment and turned my life around immediately. I realized I wanted to live and be a mom more than I wanted to be an addict. I also wanted my empty shell of a body and mind back and claim what was mine again (as cheesy as that sounds, I know you guys understand that feeling). To be able to wake up and not have any secrets or wondering what lies I need to keep up with that day is an AMAZING feeling.

If you are struggling with active addiction, understand that life IS possible and you CAN do it. I had to cut every person out of my life and don't have any friends right now, but it hasn't been lonely, it's been a beautiful journey of discovering who I really am and I'm getting to know myself without the numbing. I have a wonderful support system of my small family and my SO who understand and love me, and my relationships with them are much stronger now, something that I couldn't achieve while using. They help me celebrate the small milestones which I find very important during recovery. I want to thank this sub for helping me and everyone that is here. NA has been a family for me but I know meetings aren't for everyone. 6 months clean from heroin and THIS is the best high I have ever had. Just for today, you can do it. xx ",4.9468831168831136,5.593716848484854,5.8172987012987045,80.78451948051949,68.82683982683983,8.930562770562771,29.252813852813848,9.029198982220553,2.2958756709956707,1832,64,359,32,30,603,218,462,0.06,0.737,0.203,0.9973,0,2,2,0,0,0,38.0,0,6,2,9,20,17,1,1,21,0,47,14,2,6,4,92,89,38,0,10,13,1,5,1,1,2,11,1,4,2,32,30,0,2,27,0,1,3,13,5,0,1,16,7,53,12,54,65,6,53,0,1,1,1,22,20,0,7,30,266,85,2,0.0734799161078344,0.0,0.0,0.4005197730025874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17628558709161807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09993772537403316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06541270398285191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056501519842387625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06252599655621911,0.0,0.07711263860460578,0.0,0.0,0.08161962193447922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824139740390232,0.05866773389691436,0.0,0.0,0.28433080228657553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06430276975838238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04853279158363096,0.06646679092412483,0.1238199969672912,0.1404264175073238,0.0,0.0,0.13854065072280464,0.0,0.11146096022570044,0.0,0.07055224265313255,0.0,0.06715931212163989,0.0,0.0,0.08056693532482306,0.05677040091009996,0.0,0.153560893578593,0.0,0.041760329669413496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07275666944270967,0.0,0.0,0.06582357190621374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09850407775385132,0.07763556569526738,0.07370634704231041,0.0,0.07236291596427492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531232563484933,0.0,0.0,0.20191320113522676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20760415122499945,0.035898575396360426,0.0,0.06488411213768712,0.06502741347732117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06631849313478459,0.0,0.049048414582879035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07795057905555679,0.07419376849944068,0.08605878966429319,0.1759529039939462,0.0,0.05401619304676671,0.05448442673332294,0.11334448239100207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04979189282984441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050941721844902366,0.06415982849287237,0.0,0.0,0.06946227152972895,0.08283756485131105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031035603576502,0.0,0.07386761097738496,0.0,0.07815493560233652,0.0,0.08363623133160893,0.04707311581946425,0.07554959182159987,0.0,0.0788899308088727,0.08323842089659736,0.1255028937373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05855397966113494,0.13378671182385252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11313685864741672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11736231184318732,0.0,0.0,0.07681716251615202,0.0,0.0,0.08338413802276894,0.06925395133254646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676504344140188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058334845603343524,0.04284672999231059,0.0,0.13930073737830406,0.0,0.0,0.04988803968884866,0.07992504843624695,0.0,0.22948555223003864,0.0,0.12692611020309225,0.0,0.1212572524566298,0.17336143327752182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14166403398206245,0.15937166915116044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05219802416121888,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Sticklemore2022,2019/03/08,"[QUESTION] is it possible to get addicted to second hand smoke or am I just getting peer pressured? I’d like to preface this by saying none of my family pushed anything on me, they are 100% against nicotine and tobacco and any addiction

So I spent my whole highschool career (summers) basically on construction sites. All summer I would be around old guys smoking cigarettes, not on my crew but family friends around me I knew my whole life. Junior year we had a guy on our crew that chain smoked the whole time, but in highschool I still had the whole “cigarettes are bad don’t do that” in my mind. 

My freshman year of college I stayed away from any vapes and cigs and everything alike. 

Then my first summer in college, I went back to the construction sites and that same guy got out of jail and was chain-smoking around me more than ever. I never did anything while working, just smelled it the entire time and honestly came to like the smell. I came back to college and now, only when I’m drunk, I can’t resist nicotine. I buy cigarettes when I’m drunk and hit every vape/juul/whatever when I’m drunk and I know it’s a psychological thing only when I’m drunk, but I just can’t resist and here I am. I feel myself feeling it when I’m sober kinda wanting it, but I have the mind to resist that small temptation. 

Is this my fault entirely for just accepting that it’s a drunk thing, or is it possible that second hand smoke gave me the taste I wanted?",4.700263157894739,5.848610210526317,5.203991228070176,83.1333552631579,69.7017543859649,8.50701754385965,28.635964912280702,8.841846274778883,2.149775438596491,1150,41,225,20,20,368,146,285,0.09,0.823,0.08800000000000001,-0.1317,0,0,7,0,0,0,29.0,2,0,1,2,20,8,0,1,10,0,18,11,2,0,3,45,38,25,0,3,11,0,4,2,1,1,3,1,0,3,17,18,6,0,6,5,2,4,6,3,0,3,11,8,33,5,27,24,8,42,0,0,0,0,10,15,0,4,24,153,50,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285408554908552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14256383075401965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725176023592317,0.27993890069656696,0.0,0.0,0.0984828365198588,0.1612018500922972,0.08752120685609302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23977473635099475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09481665003486088,0.08831626408116504,0.0,0.09420640997201644,0.0,0.19763193336927345,0.0,0.10600135507604183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08916074022535415,0.0,0.0,0.08098449106075255,0.0,0.10952935520915312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08383497739708581,0.0,0.0,0.3113679885099234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05760691335711374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403821471897054,0.10242055055711542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21167877927518824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084446360979178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10999206983907116,0.0,0.0,0.15944227934111035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2363399913563759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174235768072528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335791424957044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11172530324612412,0.08371023404771231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392769093946594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224400625740252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236523542063356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717017292680606,0.0,0.4681158811769869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07631098021024113,0.0,0.0,0.07446187367546163,0.0,0.0,0.13500265210087206

addiction,meteor79,2019/03/08,"Feeling hopeless Completed a 30 day inpatient rehab in August 2018 for a Meth addiction. In the last 30 days I’ve relapsed twice, my wife has had enough and I don’t blame her. We have 3 kids and I’ve caused our family to be torn apart. I hate what I have become and I hate myself more than I ever thought possible. I have put my family and friends through so much emotional abuse. I’m consumed by  crippling guilt everyday and I don’t know if things are ever going to get better.  

I did the 90 12 step meetings in 90 days but lately I’ve given up on anything recovery related. I feel like there’s no way I’m ever going to get better. I had 3 months with no drugs, not even coffee but I wasn’t strong enough to stay away. 

I’m not sure what made me decide to write this post, maybe it’s out of desperation. I’m not looking for validation to keep using, I know if I continue this way, if I don’t die my life will get much worse.

addiction,boddah4594,2019/03/08,"7 months clean today. I’m very happy but also just waiting for something to go wrong. Everyone has been saying how well I’ve been doing but it’s like fear from childhood that nothing can be good forever. I know everyone says relapse is apart of recovery but I feel like I would disappoint so many people if that happened. It just feels like a lot, and I may be getting a job soon and that comes with new obstacles that I don’t know if I’m ready for but I kind of need to be. I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this I guess I just wanted to share. Maybe it will help someone. You all are very strong. I’ve been a lurker and not a poster till now, but you guys write some incredible things in here. Stay strong guys.

addiction,the-lad-drew,2019/03/08,"I’m an Oxi addict, and I need help Hi, I’m a 19 year old male from Southern California, I have an Oxi pill addiction and I need help. No one in my life knows that I’m an addict, not my girlfriend, not my mom, no one. But I need to tell someone because it’s getting worse and I can’t stop. Tonight I took 4, 15 mg morphine pills then snorted another and drank too beers on top of it. I did this just to feel a high and I still cannot reach what I used to. I’m scared that if I don’t stop I’m going to start taking worse or die. I need help, I need support. But I can’t tell anyone in my life because I would hurt them too much, and I would let so many people down. I’m hoping I can find help within this app because it has helped me with something before. Please share your thoughts with me. I will take any advice.

addiction,homosapean,2019/03/08,"Is addiction a bad thing? I just realised that our addictions are not just habits but in fact survival techniques for us. They provide us a means to exist in this world and escape from our problems for some time, so we continue to survive for one more day. Without our addiction be it alcohol or sex or anything we may not be able to bear the harsh life and may give up. But should such a survival be our Goal or its better to give up on life? Is it worth to just survive counting days and not actually living the life?

addiction,Patient_Still,2019/03/08,"51 days clean. Met with old crush, she said I looked so good and healthy!! All smiles over here. Long story short things went haywire a while back with this girl I cared for deeply.  It wasn’t until recently that I realized it was all due to my addiction causing problems.  Met for coffee today and just felt so good!!

We do recover guys.

A life free from using drugs leads to beautiful things.

""friends""...) have gotten me into smoking and vaping. My parents will actually kill me if they figure this out. Can someone please help me out and suggest ways of stopping myself before it's too late?

addiction,Yanks41,2019/03/09,"Mentally addicted to smoking weed. Hello, I am a college student in the US and I have a serious bad habit that is beginning to ruin my life. I cannot explain the reason for my urges to smoke all the time, perhaps it’s a way to relieve stress or escape from the real world. I have no friends, no girlfriend, and I’m on the verge of failing out of school.

I just want to know if there is anyone out there like me, or has gone through something similar. I know marijuana is not addictive but I seem to be as close to addicted as possible. I am high all day everyday. 

Any advice as to help curb this habit would be appreciated, I’m at the end of my rope and I don’t know what to do.

addiction,209anc123,2019/03/09,"Meth addict So was hooked on meth then left to a different place for a year was clean but relapsed when I returned and stayed away and now my tolerance is high and binge two times a week. Just feel alone like im alone i have friends and family but alone like alone like i domt know its a deep feeling of alone. When i was clean thought it be over when I returned but not really. Felt like an addict. I lie to friends and family cuz well its what we do and have too. I say im sober but i feel cravings or just meth will not leave and let me move on. I made money, got a car but didn’t really make me happy as I thought. I tell close friends and one cousin but they say what everyone says. Why i try it in the first place and just stop. Just stop . I feel that they dont take it seriously when i vent about cravings and i know they don’t understand but i quit a job to deal with meth cuz its priority and also been told im weak minded . Its like i can yell i need help with something powerful and addictive as fuck but they wont understand the ability to fully understand i lost choice long time ago. 

I dont know what im doing but getting high. Cuz its the only way now again to function normal.  Dont know how or what to do. And doctors domt know and rehab wont fix it. From how meth addiction develops the only way is to replace that euphoria and kratom helps but the more i have to deal with this alone then ill be using and be a slave . If it helps i used cuz it took anxiety and felt no anxiety and normal and better and always wanted an anxiety free life. Alcohol didnt work but meth haa cured it when i was high. I could go to stores and not feel worry. Socialize like everyone with confidence. I’m just exhausted mentally, emotionally and exhausted and tired from meth and drugs and cant be happy naturally. Sobriety felt good it’s alright but im tired from depression cuz im not high and tired of being a slave and most of tired of people not attempting to take addiction seriously.ill beat it but im not stable to focus on jobs or even find a woman cuz i know meth will fuck it up like alcohol ruined my last relationship. Also its hard to let go if meth cuz i like it. Its fuck fuck games and i can go on but i dont want to hold it in. Also hard to say this.

addiction,Oxenfreeally,2019/03/09,"strange addiction : holding in pee hey, 

so i’m kind of new here and recently, i realized i have a dangerous addiction: holding in pee. 

i can’t explain but it’s almost like a sexual feeling. What i do if i need to pee is i think of something sexual, then just when i’m about to release i hold it in and it just gives me like an orgasm feeling. 

I know other people do it too since i looked up but i noticed my bladder has been erratic since. i need to pee or i can’t hold my pee like i used to
 
usually when i decide to go pee , when i see or know im about to go to the toilet the control i have lessens like i’m about to pee myself. there were instances that i did pee myself a little. 

however completely peeing myself have happened about three ? Times now or four idk but three i guess and the last (recent) one is the worst. 

I decided to go pee after i finished my work then when i stood up cause i was finished i couldnt hold it anymore i just knew i had to pee cause i couldnt walk anymore without peeing myself and so i let it go and i completeley peed all over the floor. 

I wanna get over this but i need help. 
Also can the pee control thing be irreversible? Can i revert back to normal? 

Ps im not a troll.",-0.12650037509377654,2.0440580503875982,2.428674668667167,92.47362715678922,88.65116279069767,5.499574893723432,20.725681420355087,6.968188349444268,0.5516130032508126,939,32,207,14,31,323,127,258,0.056,0.867,0.078,0.6299,1,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,3,19,7,1,0,11,0,21,17,15,5,1,48,46,22,0,8,13,0,2,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,11,5,0,7,10,0,0,5,6,2,0,4,7,4,39,5,27,35,2,31,0,0,2,1,4,9,0,6,21,146,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666601643265717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224704041151029,0.0,0.0,0.09780695567547204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24258662583255855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404469879802166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512810579899602,0.0,0.0,0.1282340608981108,0.0,0.2743500488789822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12368177542132125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389911290899343,0.11732573032249595,0.27803412272246725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13473232113000286,0.0,0.10815356629510528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.081978204733071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26421994152153955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12736143480127265,0.13443083468959185,0.09969458423740143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250647542663615,0.0,0.23900742633801145,0.12258135386201005,0.0,0.0,0.10270507260531997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720619648256372,0.0,0.11812255838638655,0.0,0.0,0.11983255404938192,0.0,0.1392446137355954,0.0,0.0,0.08287677175460939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08479061980138755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2415221028891919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746094257319046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20234328122108136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941560671653699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125375103350614,0.07836785824508283,0.0,0.0,0.07131680400540412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056319178400166,0.13470125332016786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11789728350246075,0.0,0.08903921567581123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,roguewhiskers,2019/03/09,"Child abuse? My addicted mother use to share her drugs with me as a child. From as early as I can remember, my addict Mother gave me opiates (prescription pain medication) for a variety of reasons.  It started out as if I felt bad or had a headache she would share her drugs.  I became addicted at a very early age.  I remember the first time I was 7.  It happened sporadically after that until I was fully addicted at age 13.  Whenever I asked for them, she didn’t hesitate to give me a pill.  Eventually, at age 16, I went to the dr to get my own prescription.  (This was easy to do 15 years ago in Florida).  I’ve struggled with this my whole life, and my Mother has been there the whole time to support my addiction.  I never saw this as unhealthy.  I always saw my Mother as the most loving and caring Mother on Earth.  It took a long time to realize how dysfunctional it was.  After moving away from her, I sobered up and gained more perspective.  I did confront her once, and it was not pleasant.  She just cried and said she couldn’t explain why she did it.  She didn’t apologize, which is what I was looking for.  It’s really hard for me to understand.  I don’t believe she meant to do me harm.  But, she had to realize the effects of addiction in her own life.  She always said she could have had so much more if it wasn’t for her addiction.  Anyway, I probably need to bring this up in therapy.  I guess this is the first I’m speaking about it to anyone else.",2.722758620689657,4.559711965517241,4.47744827586207,83.62237931034484,75.89655172413794,8.226206896551725,25.73793103448276,8.954980946260402,2.0508648275862065,1130,41,229,26,25,382,147,290,0.107,0.82,0.07400000000000001,-0.8658,0,0,2,0,1,0,38.0,0,0,1,4,6,11,1,1,12,0,26,16,0,4,1,33,51,18,0,6,6,5,2,0,0,1,15,3,0,2,17,8,0,0,10,0,0,4,7,5,0,2,24,8,45,6,44,24,8,33,0,0,3,1,35,11,0,5,18,170,62,0,0.0,0.10573343236297636,0.0,0.6809845504073844,0.0,0.0,0.07910484685215939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14850772647465796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06239787148388176,0.09143573682460562,0.0,0.0,0.08342626857347926,0.0,0.08384282727202234,0.0,0.07451070347262646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054161307539816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09098494432584098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07124995190928028,0.0,0.0980246748562782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2069774447241575,0.0,0.07454759952341357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568328043759596,0.0,0.0,0.15181302257988094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046623610440816414,0.08560602637834805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830664258357982,0.0,0.07891361105293679,0.0,0.07994047189645156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260640628879492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07897356477386801,0.07493814980289425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08054153676451886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898987423929008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09484676368096824,0.06560081498404267,0.06616946874708142,0.06882649442137317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503645162549652,0.0,0.0,0.09495641703265442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962145623350992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05716868567396994,0.09175238971242863,0.0,0.0,0.20218041815993584,0.0,0.16977314370383398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06316370990698983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09329181087342228,0.0,0.0,0.1012671775350701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10205239020878157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1561076548543463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991476342058274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929007790948888,0.0,0.07707370514679089,0.0,0.07363138843377699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272529826100122,0.08052417243404174,0.19926395479530265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339271119251297,0.0,0.0,0.05746688682690355
addiction,Lemanzz2,2019/03/10,"Accepting Addiction- All advice welcome. I’ve been using drugs since I was 15. I started a curious teenager. I smoked weed and drank first. No big deal. Then I discovered prescription pills.  I could get them for free by stealing them from my mother. Who I now have come to realize secretly may have had her own problem with addiction.  She never really caught on as she had so many different prescriptions. Tramadal, Xanax, vikadin, flexarol, adderall....you name it I was doing it. I got to the point where I would take whatever pill I could get that day to get high. I never wanted to be sober and I honestly thought being high made me better at life. I carried on this way from around 17 to 21. Hiding my drug use from my girlfriend at the time for most of it. At 21 I realized that I had a problem with pills. Not that I was addicted but rather that I was simply taking too many. So I tried to cut back. That lasted about two months. From then until now I’ve done lsd, ketamine, exstacy, molly, ether....you get the point. I’ve done a lot of different drugs. But coke is by far the one that has it’s nasty ass grip on me. Drinking one beer now turns into however much coke I can get my hands on and then some Xanax to fall asleep after being awake for 48-72 hours straight. . I’m not bashful about my dosage in any of my drug use either.  I hardly ever get a good nights sleep anymore. I wake up more and more depressed each day. My brain just loves drugs and it’s so fucking hard to control....borderline impossible at this point. I feel like I’m stuck on a scary ass roller coaster. Every time it stops to let the passengers off I stay one for “one more ride” knowing how much I hate it. So yes. I’m an addict. It sucks, but being able to admit it to myself brings me to the verge of happy tears. Now I have to figure out how to fix myself. I can easily do two or three weeks clean. I always go back to it around the fourth week so I don’t think I need detox but rather some sort of a support group. I’m thinking about going to a local NA meeting. Most of my friend use and don’t want to hear anything about it so it would really help to have some people who I can talk to and learn from. Please give any advice you think could be useful....I could really use it right now. I need to get my life back on track. I devote most of my time, money and energy I have on getting high in one way or another.

addiction,gabeclark,2019/03/10,"Quit tobacco for 3 years. Started back up. Severe anxiety. Feel free not to read my post. I just want to write. I smoked and dipped for about 3 years. I quit for 3 years and started back up again a few months ago. I’ve been very depressed and lonely. I am already an over the top hypochondriac and now that I’m using tobacco again (dipping) I’m very afraid that I am on a one way quick road to the c word. To mitigate this anxiety I’ve been drinking to the point that I just don’t care anymore. I try to be an optimistic and in fact when I know people are depressed I like to remind them that life is a rollercoaster and things will get better. I know things will get better but if I keep using tobacco - and drinking for that matter - things might never get better. I’ve been gaining weight, letting my grades suffer, skipping all my workouts. It feels like all the progress I made since I quit tobacco has just fallen like a house of cards. I want to go back. I really wish that I could undo the damage I’ve done to my mental and physical health. I can tell myself all the cliches I want but at the end of the day I just have to put one foot in front of the other and get myself out of this hole. Thanks for hearing my rant if you chose to.

addiction,Bitgammer,2019/03/10,"Masturbation addiction 19 m here and I have a masturbation problem. I masturbate very frequently, sometimes 6 to 8 times a day. I started masturbating  since i was 9 years old. I was exposed to open very early by watching porn and 18+ movies on my dad's computer. I liked it. When it comes to my sexual appetite I will fuck anyone if I'm horny. I am straight and I masturbate to straight pork but over the years I had sex with 2 guys just because I am bored of masturbation and I needed stimulation. I've really enjoyed my time having sex with girls but I used to do it with my male friend as a form of backup. Ik this sounds fucked up and I realised I have a problem. I watch pork only when I masturbate which is very frequently. My parents are really open minded and they told me if I have any sexual problem then I should come forward without any repercussions but I am too ashamed to tell them this or go to any doctor. I sometimes feel like a deviant. I have messed up many friendships with my female friends just because i wanted to sleep with them. I need help! Idk how to do this.

addiction,the_unknown89,2019/03/10,"Ah! My old enemy! Crack addict here, relapsed on Friday and Saturday, I was clean for 2 months. Which was the best I've done yet. My anxiety and depression was going away, I was making friends and putting my life back together.

This side of the weekend, I have no money until the end of the month, I've put my back out and will probably have to call in sick to my new job tomorrow - because if they find out that I have a back problem I probably will lose said job. So I'm feeling pretty stupid right now - on top of this, in order to cope with how dumb I've been and with the significant back pain I have been taking some morphine out of the medicine cabinet ( my father is on a lot of drugs for his own back pain)

I don't really know where I'm going with this post, I kinda just need to tell some people who aren't work or my father that I've fucked up again. I don't particularly feel the urge to go get more, in fact I know I probably won't - I'm not addicted to opiates so I know fucking around with morphine is pretty irresponsible considering my addictive nature. But I am genuinely in huge amount of pain and there is the added bonus of its calming effect.

From tomorrow I will behave myself again, I don't want to live like how I used to live, its a horrible dark, cold and hungry existence and the most frustrating thing is that I was OK - I have absolutely no idea what possessed me, I literally finished work at 1pm on Friday, left work, bought beers and drugs and proceeded to fuck up everything.

I'm not angry, I fell down several times before I managed 2 months, and I will keep at this and do better every time. Until I manage to just not do it anymore - I know it can be done. I just wish I'd known how hard this was going to be, I wish I'd known that a drug like crack kind of leaves its mark on you forever, like I don't think I'll ever not think about it again. I'm learning though, ways to distract myself, making some fairly dramatic changes for the better etc.

Random rant that doesn't have much point. Over!

addiction,drpsychonaut9864,2019/03/10,"What to do til my Doc tomorrow? Benzo WD is friggin horrible It kinda dawned on me overnight and today feeling on the verge of a minor seizure, i'm likely in some state of benzo withdrawal, most likely along the lines of kpin withdrawal. Took me a good week to figure out what's probably going on

&amp;#x200B;

I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow and I dunno if it's just nerves from having read and realizing I'm experiencing every last symptom other than seizures so far of benzo WD, or if i'm...I don't know. I can't form solid thoughts.

Sweating, shaking, muscles twitching, feel hot and cold simultaneously, feel like I haven't slept all week, pounding headache, I can go on.

 This sucks. I took some phenibut yesterday but didn't help. Just took 15mg hydrocodone + 3.4 grams red Hulu kratom. Have some wine in the fridge dunno if that's ok to kill some symptoms or no. I feel desperate to try anything GABAergic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone know of something I could go buy at Wal-Mart or something to hold me off from the shocks in my muscles that feel like mini seizures coming on? Thanks in advance. If it comes down to it, I think I can survive another 24 hours. This truly, truly fucking sucks ass.

addiction,Aconnectivity,2019/03/10,"Is my dad an addict? Hi guys. First time poster here. 

I haven’t seen or spoken to my dad in over 3 years. When my fiancée and I used to hang out with him a lot, I noticed that his marijuana always smelled different than ours. Not all of the time but sometimes. He would have his weed grinded up in a coffee grinder, and all of the crystals that came off of the weed were stored in its lid. It always smelled super potent and really metallic, but he was using a metal pipe so who knows. At the time he was living in a garage illegally and sleeping on the floor. His relationships (including the one with me) were severely strained. The only normalcy he has in his life is his job. Other than that he is stoned and drunk all the time.

I smoke weed myself so I never passed judgement on that, but lately I’ve found myself wondering if he was doing harder drugs the entire time? It would explain so much. His broken stained teeth, the homelessness, the lack of meaningful social interactions and the list goes on.... can anyone shed light on this?

addiction,AliensAreHere2,2019/03/10,"Adderall Hey everyone, I'm here to vent and hopefully get some advice. I've been on adderall xr and ir for nearly 2 years now. When I was first prescribed I thought it was a wonder drug, I felt amazing and did excellent at almost everything that normally would feel like a challenge. Over the past 2 years this ""wonder drug"" lost effectiveness due to tolerance. Last month I had seen my doctor and told her about how I've noticed a dramatic loss of effectiveness with my meds and if I could have an increase. She said that with my weight loss and high heart rate, I'm pretty much at the max dose before It turns unsafe. Originally when I was prescribed the instant release to take as a booster, it was only intended to take on days where I truly needed it. Lately I've been taking the ir daily just to get through afternoon/evening activitys such as going to a family party or going out in general. I feel pretty dependent on adderall and with the tolerance I almost feel like there's more negative effects than benefits at this point. I would also like to clarify that I do not abuse adderall and I don't plan to.

addiction,acidoyflores,2019/03/10,"Low from living high Ive landed here because of desperation and curious, am I really adict? Are other people suffering these same fucking side effects too right? Hey all, lately Ive been living in crisis almost every hour and I cant remember when was the last time I felt good. Even with friends I act weird because of my insecurities and anxiety and it's just not letting me live... I know maybe this is not a Offthechest subreddit but maybe some of you can deliver some wisdom to me.

I'm about 25 and since 15 I've been this way manly because drugs and society (Chile) super conservative, sexist, homophobic and all that trash. I don't want to blame the world completely but sure it has some guilt in me experimenting life  Sure my childhood and my teens gave me as well some trouble, some many surgeries when I was a kid and not going school for it (now I'm thinking in everything than may justify my weak ass) and going irregularly in wheelchair and discovering myself as gay.. i don't know it just made me more sensitive to others' eyes.  

Ive gone to phycologists but I dont really get something of it, maybe a psychiatrist would help me more but IM PANICKING about the idea of just lost control with pills and become more ill?  (i forgot to tell u I do weed since 16 LSD since 20 and MDMA since 2 years, cant fully live without them) family's getting apart but really because of time like everyones doing their lives and I'm just here alone letting depression killing me slowly.

addiction,throwaway48583838,2019/03/10,"I just found out my ex is an alcoholic and cokehead, I still care bout her and want the best for her I just found out that my ex who was the love of my life is now an alcoholic and does coke and who knows what else. She broke my heart and did me dirty in so many ways, yet I still love her. One of my close friends went to visit her last week because he needed a place to crash and he told me her situation and idk what to feel about it.

He tells me she is happy and is living her best life, but talked major shit about me and hates me to the core, when we broke up coming close to a year now. He told me that she she drinks during the day and night constantly and does coke. I don't want to judge her life and say she is not in a good place, but she changed a lot after the breakup (or took off the facade she put up while she was dating me) and never did anything close to this.

After she broke up with me she fucked a lot of guys, one being a really close friend to me and made sure to tell me, as well as disrespected my dad when I told her he passed away couple weeks after the breakup. She knew I still loved her and would add me on social media and try to talk to me; to fuck with me as I am emotionally unstable as I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 and recently just got put on meds.

From my perspective I wasn't the best boyfriend, but I can't imagine anything that would make her hate me so much as she does now. I attempted suicide when we were dating, but I got help and we continued to date for couple months after. She told my friend that she only stayed with me so I wouldn't hurt myself again, but after the breakup continued to contact me and made sure she was happy without me and fucking so many guys.

I feel awful and think if I got my bipolar treated sooner maybe the relationship would of lasted and I could of stopped this. We fought a lot before the suicide attempt but we always got past our differences and talked about how happy we are together even with the simplest things such as going to the store together is just such an amazing moment between us.

I don't know how to handle this as I know it is best to leave her alone, but it hurts so much from seeing a person you love so much go to this. I want to believe she still loves me in some way and she was seeking my attention by adding me or it is easier to hate me than to love me, but she tells everybody else she doesn't love me and I don't want to believe it, but it is probably true.

tl;dr: I found out my ex is an alcoholic and coke head now, yet I still love her and want to help her in some way. She was never like this before and started taking a downturn after the breakup even though she broke up with me. She says she is happy, but it is hard to see her like this.

How do I ever recover from this when I couldn't even get over her coming close to a year when I didn't even know about this.",7.725169180078571,4.756090601317959,7.628344316309723,81.95315137498417,64.7331136738056,10.985907996451656,32.077620073501464,8.730908602173464,2.172743809403117,2253,53,517,25,26,726,226,607,0.131,0.6940000000000001,0.175,0.9875,0,1,4,0,0,4,39.0,8,1,0,6,43,43,8,0,28,1,38,27,3,6,6,113,93,64,2,13,19,4,3,2,3,4,9,2,0,3,24,51,7,1,13,1,1,10,13,14,1,2,28,7,108,29,78,58,13,85,0,6,2,11,91,23,4,8,50,374,132,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16910525197688578,0.0,0.05462796440503613,0.0,0.0,0.0438881066606315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08680936345217362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04955571044542712,0.0,0.0,0.032152892729698,0.0,0.08976430486089855,0.11885121786543545,0.22141070215836933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053777093433122335,0.0,0.05579726882892652,0.09087037988560376,0.0,0.05699866069363144,0.0,0.042112630274398134,0.11672278851212026,0.0,0.03401619356151553,0.0,0.0,0.05353511516165134,0.0,0.05510735071538371,0.0,0.0,0.13847264528127268,0.0,0.0,0.05167006844690796,0.0,0.0,0.08812344183953079,0.059331081612618436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393504314816133,0.04771091715646798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053338963870237316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734966736044701,0.12225208365422155,0.14628584555038324,0.0275571114918315,0.0,0.059952454498928075,0.044240045208762346,0.1687401383590802,0.0,0.0,0.10445178351770576,0.0,0.22459234474454548,0.04724920433943048,0.1562244501850816,0.05413163793002871,0.0,0.0,0.06250313784118433,0.07070778997970953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11292933318626605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11594919963152295,0.08598851057211447,0.0,0.05584939183866628,0.0,0.0,0.11176616535927507,0.05153713404717152,0.0,0.046574845211137764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13452586519903384,0.3808357332018627,0.09981728267888354,0.03520773024067358,0.1069504034472614,0.052989491831000456,0.0,0.05858785968625355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04210059544611936,0.0,0.11632104133795305,0.039109786015676336,0.08136046790152822,0.0,0.0,0.04949765608721818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714828214462866,0.04011498707286777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05035111815670221,0.0,0.04605494291865325,0.11021470143076742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056868084567834085,0.0,0.0,0.1060466864395898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0337898294461529,0.0,0.10415874671903802,0.056628444084178976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388996109090499,0.0,0.0,0.08406195135802562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054142035540939035,0.0,0.059287645783480385,0.0,0.053766935819099936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03733321764847306,0.05621920501828783,0.21061132408340355,0.044097223308544785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538904698764595,0.0,0.09942317024322912,0.0,0.03965771316510234,0.1271834189836281,0.13830449478595586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035041467313464136,0.03379689809014303,0.0518217435200274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2016006212762627,0.05860169094861435,0.03581042646410247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06344580045143011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15555198442392876,0.12559969609388758,0.08461779465931478,0.0,0.04742413409790197,0.04889518949346959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050844345690503515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11240570991294717,0.0,0.0,0.06793216537306475

Its easy to uninstall, but is there any way I can delete the app so I can't never install it again? Or a way for someone else to find out if I download/ re install it? 


Thank you

addiction,floral-wraith,2019/03/11,"Night 1 of ending my weed dependency, wish me luck! I ended an abusive relationship about 2 months ago. It was the best thing I could’ve done for myself, but I slowly started to rely on pot to drown out my conflicted emotions about the whole thing. Any night that I would spend sober would end in crying and lamenting my terrible relationship. 

Now I’ve come to realize that I’m unable to spend a single night sober because my reliance on weed to make me feel better. 

I don’t wanna be that person and I want to be able to face my emotions sober. So I’m starting tonight! It’s already hard and I’m craving really hard right now, but I wanna get through it myself.

addiction,annawanna2018,2019/03/11,"I use marijuana medically but when I don’t need it medically I can’t stop using it. I use marijuana medically for pain and migraines. I use it daily. But for the last 6-8 months it’s become a problem. I’ve tried to quit several times but I haven’t been able to. I can’t seem to go even one day without smoking. I have anxiety, depression, and bipolar, which are all helped by the marijuana, which I think is partially why I have a dependency on it. It makes me feel better. I can’t always pay for it so sometimes it gets so bad I’ll even steal it from people I know who have it. This is a problem and I don’t know how to stop. I don’t know if I even want to stop because there’s no other way to help my pain. I’ve tried lots and lots of other things and nothing except cannabis has helped. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep stealing from people because I can’t control my addiction.

addiction,Songgeek,2019/03/11,"Boredom and getting high So I’m a sort of recovering benzo addict. Spent 2 years taking well over 10mgs a day in various benzos.. I had been prescribed Ativan for years for anxiety, and eventually it turned into an addiction after a few major life events. I stayed off benzos and pretty much everything for 2.5 years, but eventually needed the Ativan again for server panic attacks.  Idk if I’ll ever not need it, but I’m happy that I can at least keep my dosage low (like 1-3mg) and only a day or 2 a week..

My problem really is that I have these bouts of extreme boredom. Like a loss of motivation, purpose in life, or even existing. I’m not depressed or anything, I’m a musician and if anything I just want to be creative lately, but have felt like that side of me died when I got sober. Now I just have these days of constantly trying to find something stimulating (mentally that is) I just need to feel engaged in something but no matter what I do I can’t keep my attention more than a few mins. 

So I go back to the thought of fuck it just pop a pill, have a beer, buy some weed or acid or something. Just to escape my reality and hold some attention in something. 

Does anyone else ever deal with days/thoughts like this? Where boredom of all things makes it hard to stay sober?

addiction,doingtheworstest,2019/03/11,"For those with lengthy clean time, what’s it like? How do you do it? Hi all, 
I’ve been chasing highs and chasing sobriety on and off for a few years now, dating back to when I was 16. I’m 24 now. I seem to get several months of clean time in and then go back to smoking weed or drinking alcohol. 

My most recent beast is a cocaine addiction that started exactly a year ago yesterday. I also relapsed yesterday, go figure. This situation feels far more life or death and dire than my past substance abuse, because my route of administration is IV. I’m in IOP treatment right now and after last night I just want to be done with it all. I have been smoking pot still but plan on stopping that after today. 

I don’t want to be a chronic relapser and I feel like I’m headed that way if I don’t stop right now. I know the needles and coke need to stop forever. I’m struggling with the idea of never being able to have a drink or pot again, even casually. 

I guess I’m asking for your stories if you feel like sharing. 
Have you ever relapsed, what was it like? Do you ever feel like you’re missing out? Do you think it’s possible to occasionally partake in alcohol or marijuana and not damn yourself to old ways once you’ve experienced an addiction to hard drugs?",3.325434782608692,4.868393193675889,4.734804347826088,83.6474239130435,73.58498023715416,7.7477470355731235,28.46027667984189,8.395991825355821,1.992965375494072,990,40,201,17,20,330,145,253,0.08800000000000001,0.7929999999999999,0.119,0.7824,0,0,6,0,1,0,24.0,0,6,0,1,15,10,1,1,8,0,19,12,1,1,6,45,41,19,1,5,9,0,5,5,0,0,8,0,2,0,12,12,5,3,9,3,0,2,4,3,0,0,5,6,19,7,29,33,5,49,0,1,0,0,9,11,1,9,39,125,31,0,0.11114853241956003,0.1316928357746564,0.0,0.2423366129537892,0.0,0.0,0.098526467671247,0.237567957458664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888544121906346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10390887386331238,0.0,0.0,0.17093272128236572,0.0,0.0677551137195841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137435386114179,0.0,0.21776649416587815,0.1288970102831021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0734125573963443,0.20108042189412725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.224800150524227,0.2382136013071817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0580705207027212,0.0,0.12633654478594147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12244263945649125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09956725325124577,0.0,0.114070460614848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11743452697915208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254731640558187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061084326632547974,0.09060088871894792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850749550055236,0.2715077930548268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08871769815843923,0.0,0.0,0.08241522843116332,0.08572460029163906,0.0,0.0,0.10430536826767912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11663168757869515,0.11836955953115412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10610385091306272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12530326992917834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10974576670545293,0.0,0.0,0.18984047876208185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118544946783324,0.0,0.12556620446217268,0.0,0.0,0.12493560738053898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07867150332492139,0.0,0.0887633615666731,0.2787754500137392,0.0,0.11619657901861437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712194915934192,0.0,0.0,0.12962320617333173,0.0,0.10535581247697047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13111656836046384,0.17644906299262833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431520214608332
addiction,sareik,2019/03/11,"How can I help my partner who is struggling with addiction? I'm looking for some advice on how to support my partner through his drug addiction. 
He has been able to admit the extent of his problem (benzos and synthetic opioids) and I want to be supportive and encouraging. However I also don't want to enable him by being too soft about it or be too hard and have him shut me out for fear of judgement or that he's let me (but mostly himself) down. 
I know it's a long road and he's already taking steps to decrease his intake - which is made difficult with the onset of withdrawal - but I want to give him the best chance of success and fighting this thing. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.",5.349710144927538,6.1298557101449305,6.208840579710145,77.85862318840582,67.98550724637681,8.742028985507247,32.72463768115942,8.841846274778883,2.765689855072464,560,24,103,9,9,185,92,138,0.079,0.711,0.21,0.9577,1,0,2,0,2,0,12.0,0,0,0,3,6,11,1,2,4,0,13,3,0,3,0,26,25,14,0,5,5,0,2,0,2,1,3,0,0,2,7,9,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,5,0,0,2,3,16,6,20,17,4,7,0,0,1,0,18,5,0,5,1,79,23,1,0.17018687824927492,0.0,0.0,0.3710576356368541,0.0,0.3326092955125634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878054521128906,0.1360983850491196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573291316623226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17860062902661852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973627480112856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19150755279900292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16325876121308025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18763163408228486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15245401480175078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11407267710506015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09353025751442964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17402761352365992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15061003178187052,0.14291411506883256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16103493914603004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16284585824460565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1779162766789994,0.0,0.0,0.3862521052630512,0.0,0.0,0.12795935242512854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11306459973599466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30114189054418083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12089587540820453,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,DDRanonymous,2019/03/11,"Addicted to drugs (meth) Hi there! First of all, this post might have some bad written english  but you will understand most of it.

So, i’m 22 years old and i have been addicted to meth for about 1 year and 6 months it all started with bad friends convincing me to try it when i was drunk while going to the club. The first time i did it i had this amazing feeling, ( i always snorted it) i felt convident, awake, concentrated, just this feeling that you are on top of the world and nobody can stop you. I felt bad afterwards because i’m not the type of person to do drugs and thats not who i am.. but we went to the club every weekend and everytime i started getting drunk i had cravings for the drug.. so couple of weeks later i started buying it for myself.. just started with 1 gram but that became 2 grams after a week and on and on.. i only used while going out in the weekend. But after a while that changed.. at that time i didnt have a girlfriend but in januari i did, she is the most amazing girl in
The world and we are still happy together. I started using the drug on heavy long work days, it kept me motivated and awake. My girlfriend and i lost interest in going out partying in the weekend so that is something i barely do now, wich is good. But it was already too late.. i kept using it more and more but not daily, sometimes i had a 2-3 week break but since 2 months ago i started using it weekly.. and since about 1 month ago almost daily.. i started building tolerance to it so i needed higher dosages.. at this point my girlfriend still doesnt know i use the drug.. only a couple of friends
Think that i use it every once and a while. I started using the drug from about 13:00 till 18:00 and after my last dosage i started crashing, feeling sad, depressed, couldnt do anything with pleasure i used alprazolam to make me fall asleep. Yesterday i used the drug and once it became evening i went upstairs with my girlfriend and she asked me what was wrong because she could see that i was going down hill and that i was sad and i said as an excuse it’s nothing just stress with my job and i’m a bit tired and 10 seconds after i said that i started crying like a river, i am the type of person that barely cries, and when in do, i do it alone where nobody can see me but now.. i started crying in the arms of my girlfriend.. she believed my excuses and told me that everything is going to be fine but in my head i was thinking something else, today i used again and ran out about 7 hours ago.. didnt text my dealer for more.. this has to stop, i used to be this happy positive person that is always friendly and always smiles.. i feel guilty for everyone.. my girlfriend.. my parents.. brothers, sister.. i heard alot about reddit but never really used it or knew alot about it.. today i found out and got everything together and typed my story. There are still aloooot of details in it but it’s just too much to type out. Thank you guys for listening! Messages are always welcome! ❤️",2.552277358490564,4.458273323333337,3.6930943396226423,88.74843396226416,76.6,6.061635220125787,24.82075471698113,6.892418011121327,0.949030188679246,2334,81,470,23,53,756,245,600,0.101,0.7559999999999999,0.14300000000000002,0.9824,2,1,12,0,0,0,80.0,2,4,0,6,28,24,0,1,27,0,43,15,3,14,3,101,106,51,0,3,20,3,6,1,9,2,10,4,0,5,40,38,2,4,13,7,1,9,8,9,0,3,30,13,72,15,66,70,12,98,0,4,2,0,39,26,0,8,62,329,112,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10674225468464704,0.0,0.0,0.13019416064069955,0.0,0.049024071894653465,0.05070541984930045,0.05402604737183952,0.0,0.16294693744166272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04028802160791471,0.0,0.045768847483345684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1226329217917176,0.05968832787328088,0.0,0.0,0.055158570954476314,0.0,0.0,0.05344913639282742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05179076272068045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039088745522153516,0.10834154378526577,0.1613332276445997,0.0315736710125832,0.0,0.04216720152454245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3974277816471118,0.0,0.0408978822998838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03233610391404673,0.0,0.08249795979017395,0.046781187323311324,0.08800006094806645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09901795122051874,0.0,0.09401415312653044,0.0,0.0,0.08328680157047218,0.0,0.053679599044091336,0.11347380955252355,0.0,0.025578381388461226,0.0,0.13911896633311038,0.04106340206693712,0.03915595086743445,0.0,0.0,0.048475827307096674,0.0,0.1042327794861156,0.0,0.0,0.050244731947569767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048213479871894165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0485829701573186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02690587555539924,0.03990706571498316,0.055226426236824985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023918262817885616,0.0,0.0,0.04332603031583178,0.0,0.0,0.05344312077466299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03267964975882732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0519363906804559,0.0,0.0,0.11723272455330015,0.0,0.03598954798204049,0.0363015195923784,0.03775920198577087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04697624051256482,0.0,0.05137287819649127,0.10427672085021092,0.0,0.0744690849799083,0.0,0.0,0.05436174015811149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12824394477770046,0.0,0.0,0.046280857890083085,0.0,0.04688795039475519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03136356090444928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09313998161268654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07802590822086744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08099664272079506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07538006981171846,0.04842042432539926,0.0,0.3811776890076263,0.0,0.11729306477707475,0.08186167090062718,0.056080888255417925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045073679169527266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274024397316694,0.0,0.0,0.05709526562143007,0.0562696825256062,0.09281236401590844,0.046781187323311324,0.0,0.03323906956118283,0.0,0.0,0.05096669984386225,0.0,0.5074048809074351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15708367872213455,0.0,0.0,0.09076857023246207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03564179396870488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05352756737908665,0.0,0.06305431666781654

addiction,DepressionInMyMind,2019/03/11,"Relapsed back to nicotine fck my life I went through 5 days of hell away from my vape. In that time I was also the most healthy Ive felt in years. I was literally drinking water every hour, my skin was looking better and Something I put off totally, was lifting weights. I felt like a new being.

But today I felt unbelievably anxious, and a simple voice message from wells fargo to call them and discuss about some simple tax bullshit set me off to load up my vape with juice and throw my hard grinding of putting a 7 year addiction to rest. I felt absolutely paranoid to talk to someone over a phone that i needed to pick up a drug to do it. 

Its like the universe said fuck you, ur goin back to hell and ill get you back to it by introducing a phone call while ur recovering and in a total anxious paranoid state. 


I am so depressed now because of how something so harmless and normal as needing to call someone made me relapse back into a junkie.

addiction,readweed88,2019/03/11,"Advice on how to start a conversation with my brother Hello. For the last 15 years my brother's life has been hugely affected by mental illness and to a much lesser degree drug use. He goes through long periods of depression, then relative normalcy, then hypomania or rarely mania. Since about three months ago he's seemed manic, and it's the first time I'm noticing red flags that it has a lot to do with drug use (he says he uses cocaine, but not as a habit...but it is impossible to have a clear conversation). And now I wonder how many other episodes I attributed to mental illness alone were exacerbated by drugs. 

My question is, how can I let him know I care about him in a way he'll be receptive to? I know if I say something like ""I love you and am here for you"" or ""I hope you're doing ok and know that I'm here if you need me"" he'll literally be like wtf are you talking about. He doesn't identify these periods of time as problematic (even though his entire life predictably falls apart by the end of them). But at the same time I read things written by those struggling with addiction/mental illness who say they feel like nobody cares about them. I don't want him not to know I care. I just want to be effective and not push him farther away. Any advice from those who are or have been on the other side of this?",5.406872641509434,5.577188316981137,6.053525943396227,81.16142099056606,67.71698113207547,9.341981132075473,29.392688679245282,9.188382445141503,2.219646226415095,1044,34,215,18,16,341,150,265,0.106,0.746,0.14800000000000002,0.952,0,1,5,0,0,0,29.0,0,4,3,2,14,11,0,1,11,1,21,9,0,9,1,44,45,21,0,6,11,2,1,3,0,2,8,3,0,0,14,9,0,0,9,1,0,2,5,2,0,2,4,5,28,9,34,35,3,28,0,1,1,1,32,9,0,10,19,140,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2169827038747764,0.09841606275440452,0.0,0.0,0.11498736404120732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07550011609692142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10431068738090607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33958905225667085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09562479448374804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3862577199622552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09833429590216564,0.0,0.0,0.0733302941478375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05613706206085865,0.0793155561455357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09443694382646756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11027186687429368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2440635116743873,0.09049936489675786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11352954544775196,0.15683904612624794,0.16272213120693232,0.0,0.0,0.09825273186167427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09438862069438332,0.10020347996333537,0.0,0.0,0.11256089357789156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22377212491855872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08861828456614115,0.0,0.08161540260959857,0.08232287714062626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12640154131500106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12437227078668958,0.0,0.11105402837600507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2648721840660419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10107206499969787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184018661449027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08547168680047204,0.0,0.0,0.07858334710672181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11606637366418378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08923687259174543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07375940147862999,0.0,0.10908050029479266,0.0,0.19421693319628588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2876672253705519,0.0,0.0,0.13096964424790142,0.08812567052734267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204007743666256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149580544447276
addiction,SmallfryDee,2019/03/11,"Bf's brother overdosed 3 times in the past 6 mos Hi everyone,
Writing because I'm desperate to help my bf of 6 yrs deal with his addict brother. Their mom died from a hemorrhagic stroke 8 mos ago and his brother started using heroin shortly after. He has almost died 3 times in the past 6 mos. After the second time, their dad sent him to a great rehab facility and it seemed to help for awhile. Now he has overdosed again and we are not sure what to do. He is draining his father's bank account between the treatment and hospital bills. My bf is extremely stressed, working a lot of hours and studying for a licensing exam coming up. I feel bad even posting on here because I know he wouldn't like me airing their ""dirty laundry"". I don't know where else to turn. Any advice would be appreciated.

addiction,bubblepop12,2019/03/11,"Best childhood friend basically older brother has become extremely addicted to Cocaine in the past year. He uses up to 3-4 grams by himself on a night out and some nights easily 2 grams by himself in his room just staying awake until 7 am when he starts work. He does landscaping and works for my dads small business and my dad doesn’t notice because he’s not always with him... but some and most days, he continues to snort a gram while doing his landscaping work. It’s incredibly scary and he knows about how bad his addiction his and asked us to make him throw it away if he buys some cocaine but he always just continrues to do it and talks about how much he loves it and the next day he’ll talk about how he hates cocaine and we should smack it out his hand if we see him with it, but it’s so hard bc every time he’s already just snorting it and I have friends who go out and like to do it with him and it’s free cocaine so most of them just do it with him even though they know how bad his problem is ... don’t know what to do or what he should do once he actually really commits to stopping.. bc I know it’s not a good idea and basically impossible to go cold turkey. Any suggestions?

addiction,aDirtyFishy,2019/03/12,"I'm 20 years old and have been doing drugs for 3 years As i type this i just popped benadryl for a high.

i'm so ashamed of myself, as i'm a week clean from all substances, however night time is the worst for me.

i started drugs 3 years ago, just smoking weed. it lead to over things i did for fun. then it eventually turned into addction. I've abused countless things. night time time really is the worse. i hate it. i crave a high so badly that I've turned to over the counter drugs again.

there's a lot to tell and so much to share. but i made a chart showing the worse of what I've done.

i feel like sharing this gives me some help or something, idk. i just feel like the cravings will never end.

it's never been one drug. i guess you could consider me a poly-substance abuser. 

as the concept of being under the influence is greater than the craving of a single drug.

i'm struggling to keep my shit together. i had a plan and a goal to get clean, go back to school and get a better job. i was on the verge of getting a job at Honda. but then they asked for my driving record and i have a year to go before my records decent. i can't even get into automotive school for it, so it feels like getting clean has no purpose now.

 i need a reason to continue to get clean, i need a reason to stay clean, i just don't have the purpose anymore.

i use to say i love drugs. now i fucking hate them. they've literally ruined my personality and god knows what damage I've done to myself.",4.319763070077865,6.9043855903225815,4.566062291434927,81.36564516129033,73.74193548387099,5.824249165739713,21.979977753058954,6.8039241337230125,0.4042135706340382,1343,35,258,12,29,420,160,310,0.151,0.69,0.159,0.3966,3,0,7,0,2,0,60.0,0,1,2,4,14,18,4,2,24,0,20,9,1,6,3,35,51,18,0,3,7,0,3,3,0,1,6,1,5,1,13,8,0,1,6,1,0,4,5,10,0,1,8,4,32,8,36,40,7,38,0,2,0,2,12,10,2,4,26,161,45,7,0.0,0.19210990495854696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186385739544986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08039987274956882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578971082522681,0.0,0.0,0.06233799402734965,0.06769024632332385,0.0,0.0,0.06898478502434144,0.0,0.0,0.0717000203536652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06472797290171868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16592596145228933,0.0,0.0,0.5640942937237515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07180415086742473,0.0,0.0,0.0535461148710782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297461541237638,0.1737497413498737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494811085568508,0.2541350593782263,0.07776994099163452,0.09214814712148968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930798585395387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16008011392745813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05433965871907849,0.17131027427657872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16089936547314784,0.07205893534713638,0.0,0.0,0.044554072037432536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188204415504858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689230008546628,0.07316903758467698,0.0767106011458258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059595938815850735,0.12022507988315838,0.12505270098987034,0.0,0.0,0.15215781683718824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08506955706473596,0.0,0.05493527831633122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707873879594996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051935658031645925,0.16670737413369302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06447029184400592,0.0,0.16409477894785485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321741450256344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0624118151008107,0.0,0.0,0.057381918073956414,0.08641006641639673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08475219483454298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085894447311537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10771890199797236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14181808944978205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763622361293229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07001863951471303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06502963937449761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16523495779016698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20882625144865286
addiction,yernlylosse,2019/03/12,"I need help. Am I addicted to nicotine? Hello, I have (I think) quite a simple question. Well, I have been smoking cigarettes for a long time, or in fact for several years, I don’t know how many exactly. I don't smoke every day, most often I smoke in half with my partner, once it happens to burn more, once less. Sometimes I can smoke every day for a few days and then don't smoke for a whole week. My problem is that I don't feel addicted and don't feel the need to supply nicotine to my body. I just like to smoke. I know that this is harmful. But my boyfriend thinks I'm addicted yet. That if I want to ""let go of the smoke"", my brain sends out a signal about the need for nicotine. Does it really look like that? Am I addicted? I think I could throw it at any time, but I don't want to. I just like it. And I do not derive any benefits from it, e.g. satisfaction. I feel psychologically addicted to the very reflex of smoking, but I don't feel it physically. So is my body dependent on cigarettes?",1.6421205927439964,3.5054418834951484,3.5889064895247853,88.64288451711805,79.19417475728156,7.2494634644864595,23.463464486458868,8.20500826718156,1.2693533980582532,772,26,171,15,19,261,102,206,0.025,0.88,0.095,0.8769,0,0,8,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,1,8,7,0,0,9,0,19,8,3,2,2,36,37,11,0,8,8,0,4,3,1,0,5,0,0,1,11,5,0,0,10,0,0,3,8,2,1,1,1,5,27,5,23,34,5,18,0,0,1,0,5,5,0,6,13,112,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5947847223491256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1484107308689938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24241551824821506,0.0,0.1218140468103392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08712346847480902,0.0,0.0,0.21112018518525485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549167765250917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18387667097020974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2206974727984508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06201543035297186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09649448624972874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314085906153582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11993903459549116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115826285187166,0.0,0.15993161116454135,0.0,0.0,0.09656779684118218,0.0916333465070394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063058804914268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427333690718042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23241855117864876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104413136159274,0.0,0.0,0.12223941207980245,0.11606258868060736,0.0,0.0,0.06990508836278453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12327457935001915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10792250444210176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2097591363529472,0.0,0.0,0.12725753942679766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900354565450736,0.12872364725592608,0.0,0.08752950976195037,0.0,0.09811201592258488,0.0,0.0,0.12182862176439667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07026972466148468

I’m really worried about her, she has been my friend for a long time and I don’t want to see her ruin her life.

addiction,kenzers002,2019/03/12,90 days clean and sober!!! When I was 12 I started using. It progressed and got worst and worst everyday. My addiction grew so fast. When I was 15 I got put into treatment and ended up relapsing there but having an awakening. Since December 6th I’ve been clean and just got my 90 days! Ever since I got clean I have been so happy and feeling like myself again. I’m less scared to talk about what I’ve been through and did.

addiction,b00p24,2019/03/12,"Tips on quitting (or cutting back) on weed? A bit of a backstory - I successfully stopped a cocaine habit because I basically drained my savings account. I stopped hanging out with the people that used coke and even though I have cravings every single day, I've only had one slip up in six months.

However, since I stopped, I just started smoking weed a bunch. To be completely honest, I hate a lot of things about smoking pot. I am not a social person when I do it and suck at talking to people if I'm high so I basically just sit at home by myself and watch tv and eat. I also smoke when I want to help with my migraines.

The problem is I'm not only using it to help migraines or relax every now and then. It's every single night. And I am so lazy and useless when I'm high that nothing gets done around my house and it's becoming a bit gross. It's very inexpensive and I live in a country where it's legal, so it's very accessible so I can't use the same tactic that I did with coke.

I really haven't found a way to have much self control with this and am seeking advice. Anything is helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

But lately I’ve been feeling like I should just od and put myself out of this misery.. there’s so much going through my head. I have a new girlfriend who is so fucking amazing to me, I couldn’t ask for anyone better. But I can’t have kids anymore and eventually I’d want one with her. It breaks my heart. It’s from not taking care of myself all these years being an addict. And I wanted to go to Florida because I felt like that would make shit better but she can’t go with me. Right now, I want to shoot up the remainder of my roxys and just be done with this shit. Idk what to do. I seriously need help. I’m not to the point where I need rehab because If I stopped doing what I am, I wouldn’t be sick. I just drink occasionally and smoke pot. I really need some solid ass advice, and inspiration. I don’t know what to do. I just want to be out of this misery.

addiction,aDumbnamedUser,2019/03/12,"Is this video game addiction? I consider myself pretty good when it comes to balancing video games with other stuff like school work and video editing.

Recently, I just got a 68 on a math test, and I was dead inside. Could it be because I play video games too much?

On weekdays, I may play 1 or 2 hours per day, but that depends on the school day. If there is no homework, I play, if there is a test or lots of homework, I study instead. On weekends, I usually only play 2 hours with my friends before I stop and do something else.

However. my family has been getting on my nerves by calling me an addict and that my future is ruined. I usually ignore them, but after my 68, I am starting to believe them. I procastinate too much, video games or not, I generally work so much better at night than during the day, but is that considered procastination? I can't think during the day, but as soon as the clock hits 8, my brain is all focused and hyper. I do my work quickly and study well, but my study is always inturrupted by my little brother whom I have to share the desk with when he rages at his game. He is the prime example of what video game addiction can do. Raging, no social skills, bad tempered, doesn't study, only plays games, etc... 

Would you guys consider me playing 10ish hours per week video game addiction, or is it just me getting paranoid? What are some suggestions to help me study more. I have hard classes (9th lit, Algebra 2, Physical Science, Idt), and since I am going to highschool next semester, I need to learn study habits. I'm only in 8th grade and Im doing Algebra 2! It's frustrating, and its a combination of a overworking teacher and me not studying or practicing enough!

I dont know if this is the right subreddit for this but I got my stress out, thank you for listening.",4.789594017094019,5.779296680911684,5.544519230769232,81.35985576923079,69.37037037037037,9.040883190883193,29.72471509971509,9.2995712137729,2.51035698005698,1409,53,275,28,24,459,190,351,0.131,0.759,0.111,-0.8911,1,0,1,0,0,0,54.0,0,2,2,5,13,21,4,1,13,0,30,5,1,1,1,47,44,29,1,6,18,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,2,1,16,15,0,2,3,22,0,2,7,8,1,0,4,3,42,13,29,35,9,36,0,1,1,0,25,11,0,12,24,180,58,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4421634017851667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437283386806158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08466467509434399,0.06181243355147688,0.0,0.08628384040207818,0.11424295581395318,0.0,0.08967996509430981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131958154333306,0.10354062783759947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734702917240598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08095956349550504,0.0,0.0,0.2615781692641629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188399192906808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470659916708212,0.0,0.0,0.1047731952646502,0.11308768443360613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09559079466585133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834130572048988,0.0,0.1059545178270169,0.0,0.05762789589597433,0.08504941927838294,0.16219751481573189,0.0,0.0,0.1004018360385031,0.0,0.0,0.0908343870688064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679662107922199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995754071577191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10952928463994822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055726729301019864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049538865764042685,0.10162933139251937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862065628482807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2236217655060224,0.0751867357512619,0.0,0.0,0.107839936454835,0.09515693046862493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23135756341167785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316014499785313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012016126357598,0.0,0.0,0.08659495449617975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20524421019149466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08387903924366813,0.0,0.0,0.10336442122095348,0.0,0.07806259150423107,0.0,0.0,0.07177136609632635,0.0,0.0,0.08477485085024461,0.11615323472137595,0.0,0.11607861765757575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09335539787617936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649729570214824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2233553127186608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08133687773635875,0.0,0.09117068135382132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22146098909219472,0.0,0.0,0.07203157461042431,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,fuckurtattoos,2019/03/12,"Dilemma So I have very bad anxiety. My psychiatrist prescribed me Ativan(1mg, 3 times a day.) They work great to keep my anxiety at bay. Unfortunately, the addict in me enjoys this “high” so much that I end up popping way
more pills than I need to. This always causes me to run out early, not to mention the anger and disappointment from my wife. She has had more than enough of this shit happening. I am currently on my 10th refill and have not taken them correctly once.

addiction,thelizabethsw,2019/03/13,"Dating someone who is addicted? I have a dilemma. I just met someone who I really really like. They’re super sweet and genuine and respectful and we have so much in common and they like me back! 

They’ve told me before that they had a drug problem and had been clean for three months but didn’t say what drug (we were talking about pills so I assumed that’s what it was) 

Well tonight they confessed to me that they relapsed, and the drug they take is heroin. 

Idk what to think. I don’t want to start a relationship if they’re going to start doing drugs again, but they say they’re in a program and trying hard to get clean. 

I need some advice. Can anyone help?

addiction,binx64,2019/03/13,"Attic Thoughts From an Addict  

Through my drug escapade I never contemplated the frailty of life. Alternatively, I deluded myself into believing I was invincible. I dared God to take my life each time I got behind the wheel drunk, antagonized a stranger, or consumed an unknown pill. Despite palatable adrenaline I’d go forth on whatever foolish endeavor crossed my path. Until i ended up in the middle of a highway, drunk as a skunk, with my car blocking the single-file merge lane; I thought I was infallible. If you’re ever in doubt of luck, ask any recovering addict about some of their war stories; I’ve yet to meet a congregation of more fortunately unfortunate people.  I had been struggling with alcohol, xanax, coke, forms of MDMA and a slew of other random pills for the better part of five years. It wasn’t until the beginning of 2019 I began to see how incompetently I was living my life. How many opportunities I had let pass by due to an inability to follow through. The sheer price tag of my last few years. How many friends and loved ones I had pushed away, and how many relationships were beyond ruined. Almost a year and a half ago a kind soul tried to help me through my addiction, I had stopped drinking but xanax and other drugs were still being consumed. I knew that alcohol turned me into a nasty person, but I was sure that I could still handle my life while using other drugs. I learned what a slippery slope that delusion leads to, by September 2018 I was a full fledged addict once more. The thing about my addiction and my personality is that I could not admit to needing help. My whole life I was the stable person in my family, they leaned on me in a way that I am only now learning wasn’t quite up to snuff. I was using drugs as a crutch because I did not know how to express my pain that was building for years prior to my introduction with drugs. Once I inhaled weed, my jumbled 100mph thoughts slowed enough so I could actually listen to rappers lyrics rather than simply the beat. I could walk away from my mother berating me or disassociate my fathers vagrant attacks. My girlfriend leaving me, no tears split because a wine and spirits was right up the street to numb the pain in my heart. The numbing, stillness, euphoria, only lasted so long. Eventually the traumatized girl would have the strength to speak out while drugs coursed through her veins, but her pain manifested as anger so people terror for her more than when she had kept her mouth shut. “You don’t understand,” bellowed from my throat more times that i remember. I am sorry for ever saying “you don’t understand” because it was I who did not understand that my drug use was precipitating a “fight-or-flight” response without provocation. January 25th I realized that no one could have saved me from myself. I realized that I put drugs above myself, my loved ones and I was the biggest loser throughout this whole debacle. I realized that, as hard as life was and as much as I wanted it to end, it was not my time nor right to have a hand in my life ending. I wouldn’t put a knife to my wrist, or a gun to my head. I had too much “pride” to let anyone think I killed myself. Reality is, I was using drugs because I wanted to die but did not have the willpower to end my life quickly. I loved my family, friends and girlfriend but my heart and mind were so battered that I honestly did not think I could get myself out of the depressed hole I was in. I care so much for you guys and in truth you kept me from actually killing myself a few times, but sometimes all the love in the world isn’t enough for an addict. Thankfully, some kind of divinity intervened before I lost my entire family and before I lost my life. I say divinity because overnight I came to accept that I have an addiction and if I don’t change then I am going to die and I do not want to die anymore. The most sobering part of my recovery so far has been accepting I treating some beautiful people in awfully horrible ways. As much as I wish to make amends with them all, I know that is not how life works. But so long as I continue living, a time may come where forgiveness is afforded. As I work towards recovery I’ve decided to notate the journey: thought processes, enlightened thought, helpful saying I find in the rooms, etc. To help other addicts, people who think they could have tracers of addiction, or the loved ones of addicts to have a little insight. 

Johann Hari, stressed the importance of overcoming negative connotation surrounding drug addiction. How the last century we have punished and ostracized addicts. How sentencing someone to rehab or jail, to remove them from the general public, makes addict feel isolated more than before; which in turns exasperates their need to use. In my experience this was true, i knew I had a problem long before i sought genuine help, but was so ashamed and fearful of telling the people i loved that I denied the fact for that much longer. Addiction affects every race, socioeconomic class, gender and sexuality. This is my story, feel free to tell yours because no one should ever feel alone. Even if they’re still using.

addiction,pallywal,2019/03/13,"Tomorrow I will be 10 years clean. So as the title says I will be clean for 10 years tomorrow. I'm pretty proud of myself. I'm a 25(M) I started doing snow when I was 13 when to treatment when I was 15, I've relapsed twice in those 10 years but every time I got back on that horse. It has been really hard, 2 years after being clean I was allowed to take care of my autistic sister again, 5 years and my family in another city allowed me to come visit them again. year 9 I had my worst relapse and the hardest year I went through, bouts of loneliness and anxiety my grandpa passed away (he was the only one who understood my addiction and help me through alot of it) so I relapsed  for a week and then remembered his memory and his words...

 ""life is hard, and most people try to escape using all sorts of means like drugs, sex, even video games but the people I respect the most in life are the people who dont try to escape hardships there the people who stare life in the eye and say bring it, and when life gives them all the shit they grin and bare it because they know without life's hardships you would never appreciate life's good moments."" 

Anyways I'm posting here because if anyone is going through a hard time just know the thing I am most grateful for and proud of is quitting drugs, and when I have a hard day and think about using I think of my grandpa's words and his memory, and how I want him to be proud of me.... Anyways this is the 1st year I won't be able to celebrate with him and it hit me hard today, but just know even though I miss him and it's hard I won't be doing drugs and it's all thanks to him, and him never giving up on me. Love ya grandpa!",4.558878825305339,4.538540455331411,5.3067352820090585,86.446618635927,69.51873198847261,8.223356662549747,27.18663373130232,7.793537801064563,1.3751296555509809,1306,37,284,14,21,425,169,347,0.08900000000000001,0.725,0.18600000000000005,0.9917,2,0,3,0,1,0,33.0,0,2,4,4,21,13,1,0,16,0,28,14,2,5,5,55,55,34,0,3,7,4,6,1,0,5,10,2,3,0,14,21,0,0,8,2,0,6,6,3,0,2,9,10,44,10,35,34,8,44,0,1,2,2,30,8,1,6,30,192,58,0,0.08296370518893094,0.0,0.0,0.09044268455875762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869946786293072,0.06346700738788516,0.0,0.0,0.05801015167032774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779471320231729,0.06379396824638714,0.0,0.10114780928380188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08458702668121867,0.0,0.0,0.07146588591176824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05350472643077455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09723284459999222,0.0,0.2886346763579934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959348965590036,0.0,0.06990049981693851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821079767144665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15917269150390295,0.0471501855582058,0.06958601972614327,0.06635365391829122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4459151047011553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055608822788290636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136784048050514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35159831101915306,0.04053187569669413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07487798305232123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090371796594335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12797344798378826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056218353753586005,0.06309763628391764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2300663482933071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07945629628468891,0.0844039141675477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08824211267275531,0.0,0.0,0.053148673951113085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09398170517128776,0.0,0.0,0.13195213657107424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08516105115595865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05872213754457248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06237838134157156,0.0,0.0,0.07638183321264512,0.0,0.0,0.05511739927482631,0.10631958471495154,0.08151141911838583,0.0,0.096753607344219,0.0,0.07863989182768077,0.0,0.0,0.11265381988529626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14330800775838629,0.0,0.0,0.04893414283591352,0.0,0.06654848000900751,0.0,0.0,0.07690818588793377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997405123540573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058935035821228124,0.0,0.0,0.4274072485580045

addiction,fixh,2019/03/13,"Video that is extremely misinformed about the vaping crisis. I wrote a comment in this video explaining why this video is so wrong,  here it is:

""Michelle Minton, the professional that was consulted for this isn't  exactly an unbiased source. The company she represents, the Competitive  Enterprise Institute is partially funded by Altria, one of the biggest  tobacco companies in the world. I've been a vaper for the past 6 months  and i would still take it any day over cigarettes, however there still  hasn't been any long-term studies about the effects of vaping 10, 15, or  20 years down the line. Even though we know that vaping is better than  tobacco in the short term, that isn't guaranteed in the long run. Also,  to say that nicotine has the same addictive potential as caffeine is  just flat out wrong. To type out all of the studies that disprove that  would make this comment much longer than it already is. Make sure to do  your research before you blindly take in all information that is fed to  you. I see a lot of comments on this video that are being typed by some  seriously misinformed people.

I honestly have so little faith in humanity anymore after reading some of the comments of these poor misinformed souls. They don't have any idea what really they're putting into their body, and we need legislation and action to combat getting young people addicted to nicotine. As a young person myself I can say wholeheartedly how much I wish vaping never was a thing, because there are so many people who I know who are vaping now even though they were never addicted to cigarettes. Not to say that they will try cigarettes, however I know that my vapes parts are being manufactured in a shitty plant in China, and I don't know what I'm putting into my body.",21.089086826347305,22.83172457784431,13.183585329341321,37.723521706586865,35.257485029940135,13.499700598802395,39.13847305389221,12.494345625449446,5.047216167664669,2275,61,248,43,16,584,181,334,0.104,0.848,0.048,-0.9692,2,0,5,0,2,0,156.0,2,3,4,2,18,8,1,0,22,0,32,8,3,4,6,39,49,14,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,0,2,27,10,1,0,8,5,2,4,8,4,0,1,7,5,22,4,41,37,10,37,2,0,2,0,27,19,1,4,14,178,49,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26871195159372896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09066977689433127,0.06570634701629872,0.0,0.6231709665222382,0.09983798876246892,0.1676225684301053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08148439396966324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05008627907033394,0.0,0.06991532708447112,0.0,0.0,0.07266718847092031,0.0,0.18253087926168848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05298884234011396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085368066014303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042927185064046434,0.07881898682226204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09275290920102236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1806202639230112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08234969505962049,0.0,0.14542472357513667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06985270950248981,0.0,0.0,0.10968992538818302,0.08330117913149046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655823471396059,0.0,0.1207996677454634,0.06092340347818553,0.12673954828471712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05567630529844386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08897536942327529,0.0784346272262649,0.17088606377493604,0.0717422454951111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16519458999070227,0.0,0.0,0.08218601698130289,0.0,0.05263622286201984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19601981248102104,0.0,0.0,0.06547389670830492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433994180046772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13123220535203114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743839244454924,0.0,0.12355387775383088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054585966048244734,0.0,0.16145099787292086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055783814805939386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07414003376236103,0.0,0.09448429473286707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11673358709647802,0.17966639530575085,0.09983798876246892,0.05291078195251634

In helping to make up the[30% of women who watch internet porn](https://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/percent-women-70-percent-men-confess-online-porn-study-article-1.173109), I had been regularly partaking in its usage since I discovered its anarchic powers; and its ability to get me exactly where I wanted to go, double quick.

My psycho-sexual routine began rather innocently, a curious exercise in testing my boundaries. But it soon leaned toward the perverse; my impulses became more niche and my satiety less placated.

addiction,But_First_Coffeeee,2019/03/14,"One week from Adderall / 30 days from Xanax Addiction is not a choice, we don't ever want our bodies to physically NEED a substance or else we might die.

But that's where I find myself. Addicted to Xanax and Adderall. I had a Tramadol addiction a few years ago, and used CBD to wean myself off that, which is a fun thing to talk about over and over again whenever I've sought other mental crisis help (it's legal in my state, but it depends on your social worker/doctor.)

My PCP prescribed my Adderall  and Xanax last April for ""depression"" and HELL YEAH it helped. Do I have ADHD? Maybe, a little. Not really. It totally stunted my career and creativity. I started making horrible choices, becoming paranoid, and it took a year of my life from me.

The Xanax isn't a problem so much, but the withdrawals from the Adderall are just destroying me. I think I'm over the worst, I didn't have a single episode of rage today - the first in many weeks, actually - and as the day went on I needed less of a backup supply of Visteral (I laugh, too, but that stuff actually works in a clutch situation when you can't dig into ""normal"" supply) and used a few small doses of Klonopin.)

The worst is now that last stretch of aching arms and restless legs. I've tried sitting, lying, standing in every position. Advil, motrin, Excedrin... you name it. It's just there. And it sucks. I'm drinking lots of water, eating healthy (and lots of it) and sleeping as I need to.

Any advice welcome to power through the withdrawals. Other than DONT TAKE THESE AGAIN, YOU DUMMY.

addiction,fuckoxy99,2019/03/14,"My stash is gone. Day one again. I’m psychologically, and perhaps slightly physically, addicted to opiates. I ate the rest of my stash last night and now it’s all gone, I have no more, no access, nothing. 

I’m only like 12 hours in. I am so fucking tired. My heart is racing, I’m panicking and extremely anxious, nauseous. I’m glad it’s all gone and now I just have to deal with this. I am going to suffer but I did it to myself. I’m just glad I’m alive.

&amp;#x200B;

We are highly focused and streamlined, yet loose and flexible (effortless effort being the motto). Our basic aim-quintessence is to harness all available energies to create an interdimensional rift/gate to haven that can propel us to 5th dimension and beyond while still connected to Earth but ultimately undergoing physical transfiguration, also fueled by the bowels of the earth likewise (as above so below)- which constructs a beastly cyclotron that irons out certain unwanted specific frequency-sets, diminishes their influence on the collective.

&amp;#x200B;

""As soon as humanity unites on this planet, it will qualify to establish contact with other more advanced civilizations, such as the Agarthans and those from the GF. In fact the Agarthans and some ascended masters such as St. Germain will already help us run the cities of light and the numerous healing centres which will manifest very soon all over the globe. The next step will be visiting other civilizations, but this could only happen after the incarnated human personality has completed the LBP and has ascended at least to 5D by transfiguring from a carbon-based body into crystalline light body.""

The three cities of light will be open portals to the multiverse and to numerous advanced humanoid, and later on, other civilisations, such as the dragons. Alone this fact will make the existence of national states and nations obsolete as all the people will recognize their multidimensional nature and will strive to ascend too and be able to live in these cities of light and enjoy the advantages of a higher dimensional life. In the first place, they will enjoy the healing possibilities there which will help all humans advance rapidly in their LBP and also ascend.

""You see, nothing is ever just about one thing. We are not just sharing information with you. We are also preparing you for contact. Now, all of the other beings from the other star systems that are connecting with you all through the various channels that you have there on Earth are doing the same thing. And certainly those who channel faeries are readying you for more interactions with the fae.""

""We are excited to witness the coming together of humanity and the Arcturian beings that you will be meeting in the flesh. Now, of course, some have already established connections with physical Arcturian beings.  A full and open contact with the fourth and fifth dimensional beings who are from our little star system.""

addiction,weedeco,2019/03/14,"Being a father and an addict trying to survive Hey this is my first post. I am in a really dark place and need help. I am a father of 3 young children the youngest a boy of 2 who has autism. I am addicted to pain Meds and have a tough history of growing up with an abusive alcoholic mom and dad. I’ve had 3 open chest lung surgeries in my teens got hooked on morphine in hospital, became and alcoholic, coke heroin addict. I’ve been locked up, been involved with a drug cartel in Dublin. I’ve witnessed some horrible things in my life and basically had no conscience until I got out of the city and moved back to the countryside where I grew up and met my girlfriend and witnessed the birth of my kids everything changed I stopped drinking and got clean of the heavy drugs. I attend AA meetings.But I could never get rid of the pain and guilt I feel for my past life and I medicate just to be able to block out my thoughts and go to work to provide for my family. But my partner is always on to me why can’t I just be normal and not do what I’m doing but nobody understands what I’ve been through I know people have gone through worse but I am afraid of my own thoughts they haunt me and no matter what you cannot explain to someone who has lived a shelter happy life in the country what it was like to live involved in a gang waking up every day pumping with adrenaline watching waiting for your number to be up. Every sound every knock on the door constantly waiting ready to kill or be killed.

addiction,GumboTheFrog,2019/03/14,"Information Recourses A few years ago I moved away from my small hometown to a city much larger than I was used to. I ended up in the downtown core where I saw first hand every day the effects of addiction. I always rationalized it as another persons problem and not mine.

Recently however on a trip to my parent's, I saw the same problems cutting through my own community where the problem was almost not existent (or at least not as visible) and it's been crushing me ever since. Now that I'm back in the urban setting, I'm trying to understand what's happening to people. I have been opening up to people and it seems like a lot of addicts have very similar circumstances where some people have very unique situations. 

So that's why I am here to ask specifically three questions.

1) Through your own struggle, what is something that society as a whole tend to fail to see. Also if you have a testimony that you would like to give, I would really appreciate it

2) Do you know of any resources to help get a better perspective on opioid addication. This can be books, studies, or even videos.

3) Although I am personally looking at opium addiction, understanding addiction in general seems to be a good place to look at as well. Do you recommend any books or resources on this topic?

Thank you again for reading my long winded post but I appreciate any support!",5.698611111111107,7.1082071250000025,6.780885416666668,71.77835069444446,67.59375,10.22013888888889,34.53472222222222,10.380263240014207,3.940846180555557,1088,52,187,29,18,365,157,256,0.05,0.846,0.105,0.9149,2,0,2,0,0,0,25.0,0,6,0,4,12,13,1,1,13,0,18,5,1,2,1,32,38,15,0,6,8,1,1,2,0,2,4,0,0,2,12,4,0,0,8,4,0,2,3,6,1,2,6,6,23,7,37,28,9,33,0,1,5,0,14,18,0,10,13,138,35,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4581705996810985,0.0,0.0,0.09313889929212564,0.0,0.10521320017616856,0.0,0.0,0.08402505797591359,0.08742729889912003,0.0,0.0,0.21435518287019406,0.11017586516563273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09822698780398437,0.0,0.09871744850540476,0.08079293762143734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929265588711108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06776195530395544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09306151685674906,0.0,0.0,0.069398253603594,0.0950425282011849,0.08852665662066002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08937314452884719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054895141451929336,0.10079345813731712,0.0,0.08812837805205506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09291373620094197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07042672331314599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05774414815661265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10266454321183624,0.0,0.0,0.09298432635816001,0.1764659705535973,0.0,0.0,0.08932741252934719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11167360183599917,0.07723910662135779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11666865741937722,0.0,0.0,0.21852852986033347,0.18348748974139836,0.1097765930024552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10062875481527787,0.0,0.0,0.3016156145100909,0.0,0.0,0.1177033106114178,0.0,0.10509920510343408,0.0,0.06731102668844521,0.0,0.10374471098489677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08372780129535495,0.19130496831083055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691562792349375,0.1181039494143198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08088861316371848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10984278364079172,0.0,0.0,0.11923306630836655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09673504965745346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133615679508093,0.0,0.0,0.21876475722025013,0.0,0.09074741115615954,0.0,0.17338878071251165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09447124203533748,0.0,0.09481002853001844,0.11730776404204454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14927852283562307,0.0,0.0,0.06766213193998291

addiction,larandream17,2019/03/14,"am I doomed (be honest) I have been using in one fashion or another since I was 13 years old.  It's been a decade.  As a child I dealt with catatonic-level depression, PTSD, etc.  Messed up family stuff I won't go into now was the catalyst for all of it.  My mother was addicted to oxycontin, my father an ex-coke addict, ex-alcoholic.  My mother gave me an answer as a teenager to my pain and struggle, and that answer was drugs.  She gave me oxycontin when I felt sick, when I felt bad.  She gave me adderall when I was depressed (which was always), so I could get good grades at my competitive boarding school despite my depression.  Drugs were her answer to everything.  I believed her, and they helped me maintain a high grade point average, they helped me separate myself from my painful &amp; terrifying mind.  I started buying my own drugs when I was 17 and went into my first year of college, sunk into long periods of cocaine use.  heavy drinking, pot binges.  eventually I added heroin to the mix.  I have lived a full decade now in an altered world, in an edited mind.  I have never been able to bear existence in this brain, in this body.  I have told friends or close loved ones during periods where I was clean, but during a period where I am using, I hold that secret like my life depends on it. I am too good at keeping my flaws hidden.  I am too good at appearing to be everything I should be. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am afraid I am doomed to exist like this until the end, whenever that may be.  60 years ahead, approximately, and I cannot bear the thought of living 60 years without substances.  I have no point of reference, I don't even know what existence without substances is like.  I've been clean for short periods, sober for short periods, but nothing that lasted.  Drugs are the greatest love of my life.  I fell more in love with someone a few years ago than I thought was humanly possible, my heart swelled to 10 times its size.  I still loved drugs more than him.  I chose drugs over him.  I have always chosen drugs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to gather the motivation and the courage to get clean and sober for a longer period, I don't even know what that feels like.  I have no life I wish to 'get back to.'  This is all I've known.

this is my holiday, my day to be emotional. i believe that throughout my year of sobriety, i’ve accomplished so much within myself. i’ve learned to be careful who to befriend, treat myself with respect. i learned that i enjoy having a job and that i’m goal oriented. 

i learned to actually find comfort in allowing myself to feel my emotions rather than masking them. or masking my whole personality. i was born sober and ill die sober. just taking it day by day. 

do i still feel shitty sometimes and want to use? uh yes. lol. but have i? fuck no. it’s about self control and growth. or whatever u want it to be about. ur journey. happy however many days, hours, years, minutes you’ve been sober!

addiction,wvsbm93_,2019/03/15,"Biggest urge I’ve ever had... I was sitting in my recliner on my phone, and the TV was on in the background. Some cheesy movie was on that showed teenagers rebelling against their parents and partying, drinking, etc. then it showed them snorting a few lines of what appeared to be coke. Now, coke was my first drug of choice. My one true love. But it’s price outgrew my bank account, so I switched to ice the past two years on and off. I’m really working on my recovery after letting it all get the best of me, and wanting to get my life back. But when I saw that, I got chills. My throat went numb like I had just felt a drip, and I had the taste. It was insane. I’ve never craved something so much in my life. And I haven’t even did coke in probably a year or so...which is why I’m so shocked by how hard this hit. 

Recovery is hard sometimes.

I took some 'ketamine' yesterday that turned out to be laced but I'm not sure what exactly, a few bumps on my tongue then snorted a few more bumps, and I just feel very not ok. My pupils were absolutely pinpoint small and briefly were uneven and it took 5-8 hours for them to return back to normal, I felt very dissociated and confused then paranoid and angry and my hands clammed up. It's the day after after I feel drained and tired and empty and weak. I feel like I can't be around people, I tried to hang out with my friends then ended up just going home immediately.

My concentration is very poor so hopefully that will improve.,2.647759562841532,5.001157737704919,3.850409836065573,85.5650136612022,78.18032786885246,7.3453551912568305,31.478142076502728,8.344100000000001,2.6019158469945363,246,13,48,5,6,80,51,61,0.06,0.82,0.12,0.5152,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,3,0,3,2,0,0,1,7,8,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,1,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,4,1,7,7,1,9,0,0,1,1,0,3,0,2,5,29,7,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3839763868259968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4543109624229499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3498381221266965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29577963238180416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3523195339202453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23400211888938585,0.2256910560918027,0.0,0.0,0.20538477347097428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2906218669661264,0.0,0.0,0.2825330210761249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,mutual_repekt,2019/03/15,"New user, finally starting to come to terms with the fact that I’m an addict. Looking for help and advice. Hope this is the right place. I will use and abuse anything I can get my hands on. For years I played it off as having fun in college or playing the role of crazy party kid, but now I feel like a slave to substances. I go to dr’s to get scripts I don’t need, I can hardly go a day without drinking or smoking, my Juul has become my 11th finger. I want to feel happy and free without needing all this but I just feel like I can’t stop the compulsion. I need help with first steps and accountability and I don’t know how to start. I’m scared to talk to my friends and family because I try to keep it hidden but I need there help. Very lost and concerned. Would love to get some perspective.

addiction,wettrees,2019/03/15,"Can’t get clean from stimulants I’m 18 and got prescribed vyvanse when I was 16. Since then I’ve maybe gone a week, (maybe less) without stimulants. I moved to CA and lost my prescription when I moved out of state, so I started buying adderall, vyvanse, Ritalin whatever from anyone that has it in the area. I can’t function without it and dread having to go without the thing that keeps me going. I drop so much money on it and I’m losing my sanity. I’m paranoid, my social skills have gone to absolute shit, people say they don’t know when I’m on it but know when I’m not. I work full time with my girlfriend and we’re completely financially independent so my biggest fear is having to surrender to addiction and lose this girl I’ve loved for the last 2 years. I was in outpatient for Xanax when I was 16 and it helped alot but I work full time as a manager at my job so I can’t afford to take time off of work to go to outpatient 3-4 times a week.

addiction,sonder369,2019/03/15,"Mastrubating addiction (?) Not for porn Hello redditers,

I feel like i am addicted to mastrubating or may be soft porn.my reddit search history is full of nsfw subreddits only.also this is not something like i am addicted to porn.infact i don't like to see the real porn i just like to mastrubate on semi nudes/cleavages.

I can't sleep without doing so everyday (and that too in a messy manner! ) Also i just like to store nsfw pictures of actresses and models waste my so much time doing that only every night.

I never worried about this but after some experiences now I think this is an issue.

Is it common? Any advise on how to overcome this ? 

Thanks in advance people.",3.660601736972705,6.4660157177419375,5.1638709677419365,75.02926799007446,77.30645161290323,7.6863523573201,27.28039702233251,8.617729084823388,2.6783791563275443,535,22,84,12,13,179,86,124,0.03,0.843,0.128,0.8732,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,1,9,6,0,0,3,0,12,6,1,1,1,16,16,8,0,0,7,0,2,5,0,1,3,0,0,0,7,2,0,0,2,1,1,1,6,0,0,0,0,3,10,6,16,14,3,13,0,0,1,2,2,5,0,3,12,66,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5661978968739477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2768972148149613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11773145326664106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14586591931997234,0.0,0.0,0.16935021312236712,0.0,0.0,0.08753758590331492,0.12368107725395328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18069831354314592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42290250611544733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12726735341486248,0.0,0.13352525867188794,0.0,0.0,0.16246679752867582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13166994152509048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12002360314403684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1970550164827694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13795881573750396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1732507889580732,0.0,0.0,0.133280667903252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593909392648926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109319962430801,0.0,0.0,0.10095102266613704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16688705425205286,0.0,0.0,0.17581761260320308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,throwaway12467934,2019/03/15,"Porn/masturbation/internet addiction (20m) I know I have a problem with porn/masturbating. I usually jerk off on average of 3 times a day, some times up to 5 and always at least once. Today I knew it's gotten to a bad point. My only real fetish is girl on girl. Which is ok I think but, and this is gonna sound really weird, I've spent the last 2 weeks making a realistic catfishing account on instagram, and have spent the last 3 days dming so many girls on there trying to see which ones are into girls. Some I know personally, others just random attractive females. A girl I had a crush on all of high school was into it, and I've jerked off 3 times today thinking about her and another girl. As soon as I finish I feel like the world's biggest perv and sit around guilty for a few hours and then go again. I'm not sure where or how to start fixing this, I'm very low on money and I live in too small of a town to get therapist type help. Any and all advice is appreciated.

addiction,Wyatt_Scully,2019/03/15,14 days I’ve had more sober time than this before but for some reason these two weeks feel like an incredible accomplishment. I was finally able to get sober before I went back to jail or treatment. I became emotionally bankrupt enough to stop on my own and that’s incredible to me. AA has helped immensely and I owe it all to the people I know in the rooms who have helped guide me in the right path. It may not be much but I finally feel as if I’m doing the right thing for once. ,4.946363636363635,5.034544999999998,5.7439898989898985,83.26931818181819,68.6969696969697,9.42828282828283,25.59090909090909,9.2995712137729,1.6565272727272733,381,9,84,7,6,125,72,99,0.079,0.888,0.033,-0.6652,1,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,7,0,0,1,1,15,14,7,0,1,5,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,7,2,0,1,4,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,3,2,9,1,12,9,6,14,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,4,8,55,16,1,0.19519044428054552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15008940326465398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33218538325443275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12588168885838674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21956297790005969,0.0,0.20168390663648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973883068897612,0.13944409239491662,0.0,0.4276431817515924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197895094809237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616640807265383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10727156350547333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09536019162530268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14348743544656786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2078714528318188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1353204772951872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20068828564298916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33338314582623524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16318795146806894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129675857985631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11381711773995876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19067270178125506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15657000069575314,0.0,0.0,0.18094349737744653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,throwaway894261,2019/03/16,"My boyfriend is taking percocets. Anything I can do? Almost 2 years ago my bf broke his leg and was prescribed percocets. I’m not sure if this has anything to do with the issue today, but think that’s worth mentioning. After the prescription and his injury he stopped.

A month ago I talked to him about our relationship because I wasn’t totally happy with things. I’m not sure if he was using percocets then (maybe I knew something was off).

And now he seems to be taking them more. I don’t know a lot about this so to me he’s still functioning and doesn’t *seem* too far gone, but this is what’s causing me to wonder if I can help him now before it progresses.

I am not anti-drugs, although I don’t experiment much, so maybe I have been too laid back about the situation because I don’t necessarily see them all as being bad.

He has changed. His sex drive isn’t the same, he sleeps a ton or tells me he didn’t sleep, and he rarely wants to hang out out spontaneously. I still see him on our regular days. And he does them in the night while I’m laying beside him.

The relationship is not what I’m worried about because I know I don’t want to stay for much longer. BUT I don’t want to make things worse by leaving when he needs help. He’s my best friend. And as a friend, I wouldn’t be able to live with a negative outcome.

But I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t want to nag and have him seclude himself from me and do more to cope. I’ve told him “just don’t do it for too long” trying to be caring but not pushy, and he said “I don’t plan on it”. But obviously I think he’s past what he planned lol. I also don’t want to end up in some out of control relationship where I start being treated badly. He’s always nice to me now, but you never know if he continues.

I’m not sure if I can help him, but don’t want to just abandon him and make things worse. So I just thought I’d ask, thinking maybe it’s not too bad just yet. Again, I’m not trying to keep the relationship together, just want to make sure he’s okay.

Thank you.",2.801042010502627,3.6575193697674417,4.171770442610653,89.85875843960993,73.90697674418605,7.501875468867217,24.10352588147037,7.831003766801068,0.917876969242311,1579,44,368,21,31,523,185,430,0.119,0.7390000000000001,0.142,0.7986,0,0,2,0,0,0,46.0,2,2,3,5,27,20,1,0,12,2,41,4,3,6,9,87,83,35,0,14,28,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,15,17,0,4,11,0,1,3,26,6,0,0,11,3,50,14,41,66,11,41,0,2,2,1,52,11,0,12,26,232,65,0,0.0779839513115584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13825613511064605,0.0,0.07808966248009773,0.0,0.0,0.062363737689027664,0.06488889465530484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12834829453226435,0.0,0.07290446741669618,0.0,0.0,0.059964844896550164,0.19534002585998653,0.14261487869597722,0.0,0.06635859877672043,0.0,0.08183934567402444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07950983572003903,0.08011099966501227,0.08249668018469586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08746563250588663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05029319714462888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06824428131731887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090436625255467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907063399897907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07628326832974403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12050041467150945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08301536627683623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15681299619898342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139498430264122,0.0,0.06931571907183616,0.0,0.0,0.12857382055294633,0.0,0.0,0.0825737444452773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06886125774032563,0.06901334289889469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0662991666725976,0.0,0.0,0.15616467916731402,0.0,0.2350360825438112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06224604592659221,0.0,0.114654354324873,0.05782411176646144,0.06014603080957572,0.0,0.0,0.07318265552815703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07444450559490244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33490231611820803,0.0,0.0,0.07418059584245203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12428622515819868,0.14198732080332932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08765722867366756,0.15608054077710531,0.0,0.0,0.06003585567078595,0.0,0.0,0.05519744211951565,0.08312051600323407,0.1245561685067742,0.06519807518665112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3674947560449458,0.0,0.11726845232760807,0.06268054608465683,0.06816141072809356,0.07179714489339392,0.0,0.0,0.1554272162150705,0.14990690143951238,0.0,0.06191054644948602,0.0,0.0,0.07391966741926924,0.07451700740700845,0.0,0.10589196787908328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735309539355952,0.0,0.0,0.3219786848464558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845702686247404,0.0,0.07919648798796658,0.15894461748365366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050219107840366775
addiction,SadanielsVD,2019/03/16,"Its crazy how fast a person can relapse with Alcohol My father has been able to keep it sober for roughly 300 days. I was very happy with how he was doing, and I was proud of him for the first time in my life. Last sunday he was feeling like shit, slept almost all day and at night went out to get a beer. He convinved us that he will be able to control it this time. In a few days it was clear that he was drinking daily. I can tell it in an instant. In the last 2 days he was basically just like before he went to rehab 300 days ago. Depending on alcohol every minute of the day. Going out into the cellar for a drink, going out to the pub and coming home late, drunk as fuck, and just gettin on the couch and sleeping. Its fucking crazy how fast all this went down. A week ago he was normal, now hes a mess. Its fucking sad. But i know relapse is very common with alcohol. I just dont know what the next move should be. I see no signs in him in hopes that he would want to go back to being sober. Its like a switch has been flipped and he's his old self again... I know I cant force an adult, it was his decision, and it was likely to happen, still I'm just disappointed that all that work was for nothing for him to sober up. He was in hospital for months and now we are back at square one...",2.5037636363636366,3.3431450763636335,3.760863636363638,92.58929545454544,74.6,6.663636363636364,21.38636363636364,6.742157984588678,0.1948727272727271,996,21,234,8,20,326,143,275,0.09,0.83,0.08,-0.5719,0,0,6,0,0,0,31.0,2,0,0,4,13,14,4,0,16,0,30,15,3,5,4,44,52,13,0,5,5,1,2,4,0,3,5,0,2,3,18,17,7,2,5,5,0,8,3,7,0,2,18,4,18,7,38,28,4,54,0,2,2,3,24,17,4,3,33,148,36,1,0.1991189150757697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17650690406681532,0.3191963464306465,0.09969441539034636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1531101548161508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08471776546420308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576165707205316,0.0,0.0,0.11166439734124373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852456825810785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668294275425214,0.19506073141156832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838831369398618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05034025315814307,0.07112529635798517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846852237217524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2761233426421467,0.052015707398472166,0.0,0.16974580220213786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804009950059379,0.10598289384966883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998662534924848,0.09888500557180896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08849302034042471,0.0,0.0,0.1641458224742124,0.16230849183432575,0.11230740460746608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07032178918196343,0.1945588880422492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07946740915410977,0.1058159473424704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058826125689606,0.09342980655668964,0.0975471299127686,0.09552998464101893,0.0,0.1044709029826065,0.0,0.0674640650466838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693147813478583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0793359976512737,0.0,0.10386222732289596,0.0,0.10219635245479036,0.0,0.0,0.0996313581874452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07950831139594898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08701935414883441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11610784065257924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197577689853918,0.0,0.0,0.16429395835727248,0.058722747552443326,0.0,0.07986059150298826,0.0,0.0,0.2768778437434261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07248047083499659,0.0,0.0,0.07072418213452855,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,helpme5849,2019/03/16,"My 63 year old dad is an IV coke user Hi everyone! I'm hoping I could get a little advice. 

My dad called me the other day and told me he's been on a ""bender"" for the last year. He has been using coke daily, IV and snort. . 

He had a few ""benders"" when I was growing up but for the most part he was completely straight up until recently. 

He told me he started because he wanted to lose weight ( sure....), well he's done that...he's gone from 220 to 160 lbs. He told me he's ""about ready to stop"" but went on to say how much he loves it. 

I'm so terrified to lose him. He's been a amazing father and grandfather forever. This isn't him and we want to get him back. I don't want my kids to even see him now. I'm so convinced he's going to die, I don't want them remembering him like that. 

Can anyone give any suggestions of how to convince him to enter treatment? My sister and I are going to see him Monday with a list of places, we're willing to handle the financial aspect because I'm not sure how far this has put him into a hole. 

He's an old stubborn man .what kinda things have your family said that helped convince you to enter treatment?

addiction,likeyouretame,2019/03/16,"At the start of the new year I posted here to seek help for my cocaine addiction I was in need of change. It wasn’t so much a desperation to do cocaine, it was that I couldn’t say no when I was offered. All of my friends do drugs, all of my coworkers do drugs. Coke is a huge one because that’s basically all anyone can really get in my area (and anyone who works in the restaurant industry knows just how saturated with coke it is). My roommates did a ton of it. I found myself wanting to do it every time I drank, and being offered every time I drank. I made a post here asking for help and was met with the same answers that I really didn’t want to hear: 

You need to get new friends

You need to get a new job

You need to move out 

You need to stop drinking

I was coke free for a month in January and then fell off after a night of heavy drinking with a friend I used to use all the time with. After that I kinda said fuck it, is it really that bad? But every time I kept making decisions that were worse and worse, and every morning that I was super hungover with a dry nose and dry skin and a blazing headache I’d ask myself why I was doing it. Someone on my post told me to consider what’s in coke, what I’m putting in my body. I hadn’t thought of it that way. 

10 days ago I drank and did coke and again made questionable decisions. A good friend of mine talked to me about my mental illnesses and the conversation really helped me understand what I was doing to myself. He offered me a place to stay to get my life on track. It’s been 10 days since I last did coke, last drank, last smoked weed, last smoked cigarettes. I’m in my new house now and I haven’t touched anything for 10 days, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but when you’re offered a drink every night or a bump or a hit every time you turn it down it feels like an accomplishment. That’s because it is. I’m tired a lot, but my mood is so much better. I don’t even want drugs or alcohol. I spent time reading up about how they effect people with mental illness, specifically bpd. I made myself accept that these weren’t party drugs that I was doing to have fun, I was becoming reliant on them to have a good time, to help my boredom, and I was reaping the consequences. My happiness was suffering and I was putting toxic shit into my body. What’s the point of lifting weights when I counteract everything with 7 beers, lines of coke and half a pack of cigarettes that very night? 

I went to the library and got some books. I’ve been going to the gym. I’ve been sleeping so much better. I’m not staying after work to drink. I’ve distanced myself from the people I’d use with. Ive signed up for school. And I’m feeling so much fucking better. Just so much better. I didn’t want to accept people’s advice, I just wanted an easier way to stop doing coke because I thought it was my only problem. But turns out I had a lot of problems. Now I’m going to solve them.

addiction,jexplicit12,2019/03/16,"5 months clean Hi. I don’t really know what’s allowed here/what’s not as this is my first visit to this thread. Addiction has been a super private battle for me, and I thought this would be a good first step to opening up about it....

Over a year ago I moved to a new state and in the first 5-6 months I got a job at a restaurant that was heavily drug-oriented within the employees, not only that but the friends I *did* see from my old state were also doing drugs. I’ve been smoking weed for about 5 years or so, so I’ve done a few things but nothing addictive until this last year. 

It started with MDMA. This was my personal “gateway.” It was the first drug I tried in a couple years other than weed, and I enjoyed it a lot. I did it with friends from my home state so I only did it when I travelled home. 

But, in my present home... I started hanging around people who did coke. I had never previously had a want to try it, but when this girl I work with gave me the option to try it I was like... you know, why not? at that point, I was depressed as it was. My home life was shit, my work sucked as I had no passion for it, and I just am hard on myself, I’m never good enough for myself, and so since I no longer cared.... I did my first line. And later my second line. Then one day, couple days after, that same friend I tried it with brought some to work, asked if I wanted a line before we went home (separately) and I said yes. This happened a couple other times. Then, I was going to a concert with some friends and I bought my first bag. That’s when I knew I was developing a problem already. 
Shortly after that, I tried adderall with the same friends I tried MDMA with. This is where I really got a problem. I was snorting it at work (I don’t even know why really, it never did much for me), and then swallowing another pill, then buying more while I was at work to take when I got off/the next day. I would try to ration it but I kept caving and taking more when the initial feeling went away. 
Anyway... I’ve been clean for 5 months. And now, I’m a day and a half clean from cigarettes (which hopefully I can stick to — it’s been my longest running addiction) and I’m proud. I am not the person I was when I was on drugs. She is not me. I don’t even know that person. I’m just happy to be clean. Can’t go back and undo it... But I can learn from it",0.7144704575378533,2.602573477822581,2.584368005266626,94.56313364055299,82.36693548387096,5.419947333772218,19.598255431204734,6.4939937576095925,-0.019703949967083467,1799,47,414,17,49,598,206,496,0.063,0.797,0.14,0.9908,3,0,6,0,0,0,80.0,1,1,0,13,22,21,3,0,25,1,45,12,1,1,3,66,80,42,0,9,15,0,2,1,5,2,8,2,9,4,38,24,2,1,8,2,2,11,14,6,0,9,40,6,61,15,51,36,10,78,0,1,1,1,18,18,2,7,47,295,99,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20777274010873564,0.0,0.0,0.056315920547516427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0701074435976914,0.05080528678066597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06661722777570146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05655557960992748,0.0593924051372027,0.0,0.059688959488851626,0.04885100307679915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054059743147941465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477353916442598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21088574048186132,0.0,0.16388756663627613,0.0,0.054718693044630375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06501371899992832,0.0,0.0,0.29470066111114496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564394906858696,0.0,0.0839225407596547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032122910003822815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32423386649108377,0.0,0.0,0.24541738321965303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07221165019487583,0.10657267315978723,0.15243334005497694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05617977692922475,0.06762935717431741,0.0569108144822689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31863116215170617,0.0631000826462254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06304417972075989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139658719799655,0.05178580508595301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044873443486737885,0.031037774240980538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05401132614784125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521282237780028,0.0675228259733451,0.046702198809614716,0.0,0.146995824363662,0.061358115203981524,0.06756536610647079,0.0,0.0,0.06095919084176541,0.0,0.06666453193999321,0.0,0.04304988461576923,0.09663555690216777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044044022488680924,0.16641704441873473,0.0,0.0,0.06005682058971059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121580142573696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209772049384908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06043201682569345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05062555217212123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0652131053515203,0.052553053919231735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993437469783337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09553400055233084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04220681540236673,0.0,0.0,0.05043608968401008,0.03704512275995259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30193108981733663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494382393661866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11778674782957295,0.11465271920506134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23125466158791805,0.0,0.0,0.0902604335605704,0.0,0.0,0.16364613605562775
addiction,worstfriday,2019/03/16,"My brother just entered rehab. What can I do? Throwaway because I don’t want this news coming out to anyone I know. Also, I am looking for other suggestions for subs to post this if this isn’t the right one. 

In the last 36 hours, my family found out that my brother has an opioid addiction and also put him on a plane to a 35 day rehab plan. 

My parents currently have my niece, while my sister in law is at home taking care of herself. The next month is going to be rough. All of us (my parents, her mom, and myself) will be rotating baby duty while my sister in law works. We also don’t know what’s going to happen with their mortgage because they are a dual income family and I doubt he will be able to come back to his job after such a sudden disappearance and long absence (from what I understand, his boss didn’t know a thing, even within hours of my brother boarding his plane). 

During this time, I’ll also be helping my sister in law comb through the house to look for any hiding places for remaining drugs. 

I think the scariest thing for all of us, and something we’re not talking about, is what it’s going to be like afterwards. What to expect. If he relapses, chances of dying increase, because he’ll be starting out at his “current” dose before rehab (we think it’s been a year, he claims only a few months). Further, I don’t want to ostracize him upon his return. 

I know this is such a vague posting with no real aim, but if anyone can provide insight on what we can do now to prep for his return, how we can help my SIL now, and how we can help him/what to watch for when he returns ... anything would be a massive help. 

Again, if this is not the right sub, please point me in the right direction. 

Thank you so so much.

addiction,AshleyIsAFag,2019/03/16,"Addiction I searched for games to play on here and i came across a picture of heroin. Last thing i want to see is heroin or meth. Cause i was a meth user for a bit and shooting up was addicting and it was honestly a lot more bad times than good. I'm 10 months and a couple weeks clean. I drink a lot now though. I'd prefer that to meth, but i still miss it even though i hate it. And when i saw that pic of heroin I was like mm I want to try that(which is fucked up).

addiction,556champion,2019/03/17,"Are there drug-resistant mental disorders caused by addictions? Is there a mental disorder where your brain just doesn’t respond to medication correctly once sober? Has anyone experienced this? 

I had a twelve year addiction to porn, amphetamines, and smoking. I’ve been clean and sober almost three years now. Just a few weeks to go till that three year mark! Since getting sober I’ve struggled with mild flashbacks to abuse as a toddler. I struggle with nightmares as well. I’ve been formally diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder and bipolar type 2, but I don’t respond to medication. Literally there’s only one drug left to try after the one I’m currently on, and I’m currently on Lithium, so we are kind of throwing a Hail Mary. I know that “ketamine-like” nasal spray for drug-resistant depression was approved in the US recently, but it’s not really for bipolar or anxiety. 

I guess I just kind of feel like drugs and porn messed my brain up and I just don’t respond to medication. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you get through this. 

For the record, my liver, kidneys, thyroids, etc tested almost flawlessly. I have no idea how my liver is alive haha. Also I tested negative for a gene mutation that would cause this. 

Also, I have tried therapy, and continue to do so with great success, but we’ve reached a point where my therapist feels like this is a medical issue rather than a thought/behavioral issue. I’m thinking about getting a second opinion. 

I’m honestly starting to feel a little bit hopeless. Like life is still worth living and sobriety is still worth it, but it’s hard to believe I’m actually going to get better.

addiction,iAintGotNoClueHow,2019/03/17,"My brother told my family he is over getting sober and our bridge has burned for him. What can we do? My parents have been dealing with my brothers addiction for about 13 years now. They have helped him get into multiple recovery facilities, have been supportive financially for them all, and made the effort to visit him. The longest he’s been sober is about 4 months and then he relapses and he goes back to square 1. 

In the past my parents would try to find him new recovery facilities and do all the work. Then we learned that he has to want it. So the past couple of years he has sought out the places and asked for help financially, to which my parents were happy to help. Then it transitioned to SLE’s. And the cycle continued. 

We and the facilites have warned him before that our support will soon run out and we will have to turn him away. 

After a couple of years of his relapses seeming  to be getting worse, that time is coming. Every time he relapses he gets kicked out of the SLE, doesn’t show up to work, lives on the streets in his car, camps outside my parents house and causes our neighbor to be on edge (he broke into a neighbors house once, and another neighbor watches him on their cameras). 

My brother admitted the other night that he is “over” getting sober and going to NA meetings. He’s been on a 2 week binge. My mom has gotten to the point where she doesn’t talk to him or want to see him. What’s worse is that my dad, who has taken longer to minimize co dependency, is now at his wits end. 

The future is not looking good for my brother. Is there anything we can do that we haven’t already done to help him get sober? Or is this all we can do and hope for the best?

addiction,namroom,2019/03/17,"My bf told me I am a massive reason for his addiction I have been feeling so guilty. And the other day, my bf told me I am a massive reason for his addiction. 

Opiates. His favorite thing in this world. Before I met him he told me was clean, he convinced me he didn’t have a problem and that it was just fun to do sometimes for him like weed was for me. Not a big deal and he could stop whenever he wanted. I had never experienced an addict. I didn’t know what it would be like, I didn’t think I could love one. Boy was I wrong. The manipulation an addict can do is so scary. I had never tried a pain pill for recreational use and he had me convinced it was harmless. I blame myself every bit for trying it. I shouldn’t have but I did. He would ask me if I knew people with roxys and I did. He would tell me if I didn’t get those he would just go find worse. In my mind that meant heroin. I knew he would and as bad as it sounds I didn’t want him getting something that he had no idea where it came from and I knew mine were real. I cared deeply for this guy yet I’m giving him pills. I would tell him no and it would result in him not leaving it alone until I did it. And that’s no excuse for why I brought them. I probably got them for him 10 times. He’s been an addict for 3 years, he started roxys before I ever knew him. On Friday he decided to tell me I was a massive reason for his addiction. I have sat in my bed crying. I feel like I’m going to have a heart attack every second. The idea that I am the reason for someone being addicted to opiates makes me feel like the shittiest human. Idk I didn’t get on here to pity party I just don’t know if anyone else has experienced this type of guilt or how to stop thinking about it.

addiction,Journey2TheSky,2019/03/17,"I have somehow landed myself in the 9% of people who actually get addicted to marijuana. I started smoking marijuana a year after being hit by a car. I was desperate to get rid of the never ending headache that had been haunting me sense that day and was slipping quickly into a deep depression. We later discovered the infinite headache was caused by occipital neuralgia which is nerve pain across the top of your skull, back of your head and occasionally all the way into my jaw which explains why Tylenol and Advil wouldn't touch it. I was smoking every day for over a year before I was able to get proper treatment for the occipital neuralgia but now that it only comes back on occasion I still can't stop smoking marijuana. I'm addicted to the body high and the mild hallucinogenic effects like seeing the mandalas and patterns in my vision. It also helps the back pain from the accident but that can also be handled just fine with advil and tylenol. I just can't stop smoking weed and I don't know how to break its grasp. Longest I've gone is 4 days without it and I get intense cravings every time I see anyone smoking anything or any time I smell it and sometimes even when the thought simply crosses my mind. I need sobriety back in my life but don't know how to achieve it. I've gotten rid of all my pipes and grinders but I have so many friends who smoke that I'm still getting a dose every day without fail. I don't want to push these friends away either as they have been better friends to me than the majority of my sober friends throughout my life. I'm going to try moving 30 minutes away and have gotten into the college in that town. I hope that is going to at least slow me down but I'm afraid I'll find more weed and the process will begin again.

I'm trying to escape but I feel so trapped.

addiction,PopPunkJess,2019/03/17,"Dilemma I’m facing. So I’m 22. I spent 16 to my early 22 being heavily dependent (perhaps addicted) and a whole host of shit. You name it - I may have done it. Heroin was a massive one for me and alcohol. 

So a situation happened where I lost someone I cared a great deal about last April. (I still remember the date and everything) so I used drink and drugs to cope and I had severe mental health issues at the time. I normally use drink and drugs to cope with that and life tbh. 

But nah from around June 2018. I’ve not had any alcohol. HOWEVER, I would occasionally (like every 4 weeks and only if i am desperate) would take Xanax in order to catch up on some sleep. I typically get maybe 3-4 hours a night. Yes, it sucks. 

2019 and I was like I would like to stop taking Xanax. So I have done however, my health has declined drastically due to a lack of sleep which does weaken your immune system and bodies recovery from workouts and that lark. 

Am I going down a dangerous road again by using Xanax to help sleep? All other avenues have failed. I talk to my doctor about it but he never does anything to sort it. I wanna stop feeling this ill and fucking dead all the time. 

I think I can manage it but idk man.

addiction,addictthrow123,2019/03/17,"I seriously need help I am addicted to pornography and masturbation. This interferes with daily activities and responsibilities and I'm tired of looking for help by just reading online. 

Aside from messing with my responsibilities as a whole (always late, for example), what is really eating me alive is guilt. I'm in a relationship, I've been in it for a long time now. It's healthy, we're happy, but I am constantly betraying the trust of the person I most admire. 

The guilt is killing me, it's been going on for so long. It's compulsive, and it makes me feel worthless. I spend all day thinking about this, how I need to control myself, but once I get some time alone I fall into the routine. I feel like I've betrayed the most important person in my life and there's no going back from that. Looking at each other in the eyes is not the same for me, because I know what I've done. 

I'm going in circles now, but what do I do? I despise myself... In public, with friends and family, people love me, they say I'm the best and they love my company and opinion on subjects, almost like a role model... At night though, I fall into my own mental traps, and it feels nauseating to even look at myself in the mirror... I am not exaggerating when I say I feel repulsive.

I've been lost in this cycle for years, I don't know what to do. So many posts and forums read, so many nights of trying to hold off, but nothing has worked for me. I need someone to at least point me in a different direction, a new way to look at my addiction.

And to the person I love, I'm sorry. I feel like I don't deserve your love, I definitely do not... I'm destroyed by this, and only I could have prevented it. I am so ashamed. I am so sorry...

addiction,MikeMandra,2019/03/18,Is it possible to go back to ‘recreational use’ I’ve had a bad coke problem for around 4 months. I’m 24 now but since I was 19 I did coke once a month or so. Then around 4 months ago I was in a bad spot and started doing it during the week. I’m going to try and get off it on my own if that doesn’t work I’ll have to go to rehab. I don’t want to quit drinking in the slightest though I also don’t want to never to blow again. Obviously I need to stay away from it for several months but I feel like I could get back to doing it just here and there. I know in rehab they’ll say that’s impossible and probably tell me to never drink again as well. Do you really have to go completely sober forever?,2.0548739002932592,2.6220302645161304,4.2177126099706745,89.92111436950148,75.38709677419354,7.958944281524928,21.832844574780054,8.296473431620573,0.8028064516129034,541,12,133,9,11,188,94,155,0.062,0.8759999999999999,0.062,-0.2617,0,0,2,0,0,0,8.0,0,1,1,2,14,5,0,0,5,0,15,6,0,1,3,22,30,13,0,6,5,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,7,6,4,0,2,2,0,4,5,3,1,0,4,2,13,2,24,24,1,28,0,0,0,0,4,8,0,2,16,87,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12123601713954045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10937281250198304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2435039027068942,0.0,0.0,0.12849744166973193,0.2103313233175499,0.2283900742559864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14339798025728964,0.0,0.0,0.10919761221469497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2679598999449027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0691536892220281,0.09770663299433807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429106068576068,0.0,0.3109121816916318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07516376711373826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06681762622840852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366656241206534,0.0,0.0,0.10141126828964288,0.21096684689672213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14565278028643674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15418465453834188,0.0,0.0,0.14745835170039326,0.1308678976174742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454689278703718,0.0,0.0,0.08761667624700319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087628982115558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15450819334270705,0.0,0.11313537777139562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680464499466683,0.1457758137785462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11954070541134472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13437324185921345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285606329479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11812309118868045,0.0,0.0,0.1613378709776466,0.0,0.10970653064726672,0.0,0.12297028637483758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09956827072449544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I know if I try to leave she will become extremely violent, and I don’t want my kids to see that, and don’t want police involved, as I don’t want my kids to see that either.

addiction,davy1jones,2019/03/18,"Advice on dual diagnosis rehab programs? What are inpatient rehab programs like? Im 24 and im looking to treat my adderall/alcohol addiction that stems from depression and grieving. My insurance limits me to only a handful of rehab centers and im rather hesitant towards them. I’m worried that i wont be confortable staying there with my anxiety and stuff. I have a horrible feeling that I will feel like im in prison. Has anyone had experience with the mid-tier rehab centers? Specifically dual diagnosis? 

I read reviews on some places and theyre always all over the place. 
 
I live in MA and am limited to programs in MA, RI, and NH. Thanks in advance for any input. desperate to help myself.

addiction,idlehour0,2019/03/18,"First post here need some help so lost day 2 no cocaine cant stop using anything Hi sorry this may be a bit long or possibly make little sense. I was doagnosed with polysubstance abuse when i was in my 20s im 32 next month and i have been addicted to cocaine for the last year. Im on about 12 perscription medications for various things i have bad fibromyalgia and alot of other things they haven't figured out reccently like swallowing problwms they think is dysphsgia but only say is gerd and ibs-c pain but i can barley eat\swallow anymore and lost 80lb in the last year. Anyway i was taken off my klonapin (1mg ,3x a day for 7 years) and tramadol (started ar 600mg a day for almost 2 yeaes then 300mg a dat for 2 more taken off cold turkey) and last month cold turkey taken off my gabapentin 1200mg 3x a day. No drs believe i could have possibly went through withdrawl. The only thing i was taken off slowly was klonapin however it wasnt slow ebough. Before the coke i only used weed for like 15 years i had a breif period of norco\vicoden abuse somewhrte in my 20s and adderal abuse in the teens but was clean otherwisr the weed which i found to be helpful to my cravings howrver now i cant live without any type of substance ive been 2 days off cocaine but ive beem using phenobut for s couple months off an on but steadoly for almost s week as well as etizolam 2x a day. Tried to stop phenobut and went into horrible withdrawl and a fibromyalgia flare my current therapist specalozes in borderline personality disorder which ive been diagnosed with since 18 he wants me to see someone else for the substsnce abuse issue snd i dont kno where to go because im so worroed fhe place is goinf to treat me bad not help me hospitalize me or theyre never going to give me any meds back that actually help me. My rheumatologist sugesred vicoden over the tramadol which I find absurd when tramadol I didn't have problems with!and no one will give me benzos and no one but my therapist who doesnt control my meds knows about the cocaine.

addiction,PestoPastaPenne18,2019/03/18,"Food addiction.... is it me? I’ve been on a never-ending weight loss journey that keeps stopping short due to my obsession with food. I can shut off my addictions sometimes and do amazingly well with dieting..... other times I binge some Taco Bell which sets me back 10 times. I’m trying not to find excuses like I always do but I truly believe there’s some deeper psychological issue with my obsession over food that’s more complex than just greed. I have a few mental illnesses and they’ve fluctuated in severity over the years and I thought once i became medicated for them, then I could finally loose weight. But even though I’ve gotten somewhat better mentally, I still have this obsession with food. The only persistent mental health symptom I still have is anxiety and minor-ish bouts of depression and I think I use food to cope with these. I noticed I use food to help with boredom, and if I don’t eat a food I want- I’ll get anxiety. Is there a deeper reason to this or is it just plain greed?",4.937364914877868,6.3644767150259085,5.805081421169508,77.99690414507774,69.41450777202073,9.452109548482603,28.811621021465587,9.784248007369934,2.7931320503330865,798,29,147,19,14,262,119,193,0.191,0.73,0.08,-0.9681,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,1,3,10,11,2,3,6,0,13,17,0,3,0,33,22,12,0,3,7,0,2,1,0,0,6,0,0,0,9,12,11,2,5,0,2,1,2,7,1,0,3,2,22,4,19,18,5,19,0,2,0,0,3,7,0,5,11,96,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19313335475129897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07370672646819414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13552888343207445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0681135415231854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09980077602068686,0.0,0.07834294942872176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07072494934659802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07629493226434841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09064077043349694,0.0,0.0,0.07845672752157598,0.0,0.0,0.05850710430425931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09703646954336287,0.08096169107709761,0.0,0.7497899027586715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04628006613928348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09415776530343924,0.0,0.0,0.05937416912860258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09245584896686583,0.0,0.07873511750683425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04327634217104398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08923632692631522,0.2678073067578568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06831934901308342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008503817948206,0.0,0.09433617914369692,0.0,0.06737006001006797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09107631571601976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007164008597964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087609157367657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14148225965048955,0.07405792192273665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920698738439354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056759311634605875,0.08703066423600903,0.07032364685650623,0.1033049210217717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06014087890618981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15301158095943698,0.0,0.0,0.05224753784060523,0.0,0.0,0.2157362860427096,0.07964521474972926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05704344425543473
addiction,SubjectTruth,2019/03/18,"Sister of an addict This might be long, and all over the place but been wanting to tell someone. 

&amp;#x200B;

My one brother has been an addict for the last...17 years In and out of rehabs, he was doing well in a long-term living facility for about a year, came home and then within two months starting using again. He's been home again for two months and has been activity using. I just don't know what to do, I feel so many different types of emotions through all of this. My mom loves to say that this doesn't effect me and my other brother, and how she is the only one that cares (which is all completely false) which just makes me angry. The only memories I have with my brother (the addict) is him being high, in jail, or in a rehab. Sometimes I think back to a funny/good memory and then think ""he was probably high then."" This is also the same brother that molested me when I was younger (felt real good getting that out) I told my mom when I started remembering, but she didnt believe me and pushed it away, haven't talked about it since. I know that you have to want help to get help, but I don't think he wants help right now. He says he does, he says he's going to do x,y,and z but never takes any steps towards those goals. He went to detox, and then within the next week he was back to using. Now he is currently outside trying to go back to detox, not rehab, but detox. I just don't understand, why just go to detox to just come home again and then start using? Nothing has changed besides the detox. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all very hard on my mom, but I can't talk to her about any of this. Anytime I mention something that he might of done or he's acting weird, she gets so defensive and angry at me, like I did something wrong. I can't tell her my opinion on anything regarding my brother without her yelling at me. But, she has never asked how I am doing with all of this. This is hard, and has a major impact on my life. A huge part of me hates my brother for what he has done to me. I am pissed off, sad, worried constantly, afraid. Having a brother who is an addict is...hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother wouldn't come home for a week (some disagreement with my mom) and then he came home, he's been home for a little longer than a week. I found out a couple days ago that while he was who knows where, (in a nasty motel) that he overdosed. The cops brought him back with narcan and then the hospital. like what?! and then within a couple days of being home...he is high and back to using.

addiction,KoKoRein,2019/03/18,"I need help turning the negative voice off in my head I’ve completely turned my life around from where I’ve been the last 20 years and I’m really proud of myself, for the most part, but when I give myself somewhat of a break, I feel like I’m failing. 

Since I was 14 I’ve been ‘on something’, I started with weed and that progressed into E, crack, coke, meth, and then alcohol being the longest and most damaging ‘drug’ of them all. I was a (functioning) alcoholic for the better part of 13 years. But! I haven’t touched anything in 3 months and I’m not looking back! 

I’m exercising, watching what I’m eating, taking multivitamins, meditating, and sleeping well. I’m just taking care of every part of myself.

But sometimes say I’ll eat a bowl of ice cream and I know it’s not healthy or it’s fattening so I start to feel ashamed, guilt, and failure. Or another example is my goal is to exercise 5 days a week, the two days I don’t exercise I feel the same way, that I’m failing and I feel
guilty. Which really ruins the rest of my day because I’m feeling down about myself. 

I’m just wondering how I get this negative voice to shut up and just relinquish the strides I have made. The rational part of me is proud and I can see such an improvement in myself but this other part of me won’t let me relax or see the positives.

addiction,Mayor-Proctor,2019/03/18,"What is addiction to you? To me addiction is something that fills the void until you are ready to address your own internal personal issues or it is just laziness as one is not willing to go through unfamiliar and deep personal discomfort which isn't that bad and actually empowers you into a person you never knew existed. It is just different but once there is resolve at the end it is worth it and you would of wished you had done it before or never depending on how much pain you can take.

&amp;#x200B;

I base this on how I personally resolved my addiction problems once and for all and:

\- 18 years of addiction to alcohol. 10 years of which I was a chronic alcoholic and ended up homeless for. Many years hanging out on park benches.

&amp;#x200B;

\- 15 years of gambling addiction

&amp;#x200B;

\- 18 years of smoking addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Multiple suicide attempts because of addiction and family trauma.

addiction,MajMin5,2019/03/18,"I bought another juul and i hate myself for it Like many modern day teens I started vaping in high school to look cool and I ended up with a nicotine addiction. My friends all did too, to varying degrees, but I really feel like I got it way worse than they did. I mean from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep I'd be inhaling very high concentrations of nicotine. 

Last year about November my friend gave me his juul. He said it made him feel awful and he hated using it so he wanted to get rid of it. I figured hey, free vape, I'll take it. Juuls are so much more addictive than other vapes for some reason and I wish I'd known this before I used it. I was chewing through my bank account buying pods for it and after three weeks I got sick of how it made me feel and we took it out into his backyard and shot it, blew it to pieces. I still had my other vapes though, so I still had nicotine. 

Around January I lost my vape in my girlfriend's couch, and I decided I was gonna try to go without, because she didn't like me doing it and I really didn't like it either, but I couldn't help myself. So I quit, cold turkey, and it worked for a while, until just last night, the same friend who gifted me his juul months ago and I got a little drunk and we went out and bought a juul together and we agreed that he'd keep the pod and I'd keep the other part so we could only use it when we're together and we won't get addicted we'd just get to feel a little fuzzy when we're hanging out. But after he fell asleep when I was leaving I took the whole thing, the whole drive home I was mad at myself, I couldn't stop myself from taking it, and it feels so stupid, I can't stop myself from sucking on a USB flash drive, especially reading some of the other posts in this sub it makes me feel like it's absolutely ridiculous that this is even a problem, but I just wanted to post somewhere about it so maybe someone could help me or tell me I'm not weak or dumb or anything and idk where else this belongs. I'm just really upset with myself over all this.

addiction,mariocova3,2019/03/19,"How I let go of my nicotine addiction  Hi guys, just want to share a strategy that worked for me and may help others.  I vaped for about all of high school, and smoked cigarettes here and there. I wasn't a smoker for 10 years or anything like that but I think this principal still stands and could work for others.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start by exposing the lure of nicotine for what it is.  Nicotine feels good.  I could think of no better way to compliment my gaming sessions, my car rides, my social interactions, and my alone time than blowing clouds and getting a light fix of nicotine.  

&amp;#x200B;

How did I let this part of my life go then if it was so good?

&amp;#x200B;

That is because it is not ALL good.  I remember shortly after I quit nicotine I came to a point where I thought to myself, ""Are you sure you want to give up vaping \*forever\*?  Don't you remember how good it felt to vape in the morning?  Don't you remember how good it felt to vape while your game loaded? etc.  Maybe you should stop trying to quit vaping and just accept that it feels good and you're going to do whatever feels good.  Maybe you can feel good right now.""

&amp;#x200B;

Addiction lies.  Addiction shows you sunshine and rainbows just beyond getting your next fix.  The truth for me was that vaping was not \*all\* good.  I would frequently get nicotine poisoning, have oil on my fingers, have to buy juices, have to charge batteries... Basically have to deal with all the bullshit that comes with it.  There also is a point in using nicotine where you become ""over it"":  You no longer crave nicotine and giving yourself more of it doesn't make your problems of being bored and such go away, it just makes your feel sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I am tempted to start vaping to feel better, I remind myself of all the bullshit that comes with it and this seems to break the illusion of ""sunshine and rainbows"" that I am so easily drawn to.  I think this can be applied to other addictions outside of nicotine, I am going to start using it to counter my lethargy.  I hope this helps others.",4.278275255754476,6.244527501278776,4.415721707161127,85.16698409526856,71.94117647058823,7.445044757033249,27.05250959079284,8.17850203761792,1.786721803069054,1627,58,304,25,32,505,185,391,0.094,0.705,0.201,0.9932,0,1,3,0,0,0,72.0,0,13,0,6,21,23,1,0,11,0,32,8,1,8,7,71,69,25,0,10,9,0,9,1,0,3,7,0,0,1,30,19,0,1,17,3,1,10,8,3,0,0,9,13,43,20,51,51,8,40,0,0,2,0,25,14,0,5,14,216,73,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25732779585935084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061118785463598474,0.0,0.047191991325819686,0.0,0.3196981742257954,0.3585310790825883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04856196747261388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05544385312902202,0.0,0.0,0.035973256081995635,0.06517427820398967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043828940038539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06749417327969541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10166747587453397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09423279241982874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060838930654039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06581414123522766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17902988287085753,0.0,0.11332182777619942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924942309461439,0.11321965415314958,0.16768981072441033,0.44546928945946135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0584313017850648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910919422757477,0.062349571566994534,0.0,0.05861237563237981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12068783365647714,0.0416820234659452,0.028830353405474924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0787821305324567,0.0,0.11857126357596624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06276008607111744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06390440273590693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157110355706094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056466653347513815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12553336108295485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20054777089615708,0.05039604970261529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0597234416148397,0.0,0.053722440796761424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06015545062227665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12530730066408072,0.0,0.047127175515517684,0.04933679591192816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05561824862401927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11343779982671973,0.0,0.04684905169715228,0.034410456523924215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04006537304212041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193509277553132,0.0,0.0,0.1044206768601466,0.046841094199413284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08592308931018962,0.0,0.0,0.04192053492429206,0.0,0.3585310790825883,0.038001886824207486

addiction,willowtree273,2019/03/19,"I need to quit smoking but can’t I’ve been smoking weed every day for a little over 2 years. It’s ruined my life to say the least, but it’s time for me to quit and get myself to a happy place again.

I’m posting here cause I’m really hoping someone has a similar story or can give advice because I’m really at a loss here. 

Like I said I’ve been smoking everyday, all day except if I had class or work. Sometimes I would even smoke during breaks so I could get through the day without a panic attack. I know it’s horrible, but I used smoking as a way to cope with any stress in my life.

Now here’s the problem I’m running into. I have a very sensitive stomach. I get sick easily and when I get sick I get VERY sick. The nausea is caused by my anxiety and my body shuts down. I had 16 visits to the hospital in 2018 because of these panic attacks that turn into extreme vomiting that lasts for days. I got so sick I went 3 weeks without eating (but was hospital so I was getting help). 

Anyways, a big reason why I got into smoking weed is because I heard it helps nausea. And honestly it was like my saving grace and would stop my nausea AND panic attacks within minutes. It was the only thing that would calm my stomach. But now I’m extremely addicted and smoke even when I’m feeling fine.

This morning I woke up ready to quit. So determined. And then I got really nauseas and started getting sick. So I smoked. I am so frustrated with myself. 

Has anyone been in this position before? My stomach problems are 100% related to anxiety and nothing else. It sounds like I have a strange stomach issue but I’ve been checked by a doctor so many times and my stomach is fine. I am on medication for anxiety as well. I’ve tried so many kinda of medication but weed has been the only thing that helps my stomach so far. When I’m sick I can’t swallow a pill (or even water for that matter) so smoking worked the best for me.

addiction,wishiwasborninirelan,2019/03/20,"I'm looking to learn more about how I can take care of myself/deal with shame surrounding alcohol after a serious wake-up call... Earlier last summer, my ex girlfriend died. We JUST got the autopsy report and the cause of the death was an overdose. However, before she died she sent out a ton of terrified texts about her abusive boyfriend and how she was scared for her life and he kept breaking in to her apartment. When her parents went to pick up her body, there was a cinderblock underneath her bedroom window, where he had been climbing in. I had drank too much before, but it was more like any typical college kid—binge drinking but not to the point where it felt overtly dangerous. But, after my ex died, I kind of lost it. I couldn’t stop thinking about her alone in that apartment, across the country with him, and how scared she was. I spent so much time drunk, it was honestly terrifying looking back. I sort of justified it because I’m a grad student and I made all As that semester, so I clearly thought I was handling my shit (i wasn’t), Earlier this month, I went to the hospital because I was suicidal. They wanted to send me to inpatient but I already have felt so isolated since I moved here. I thought that, too, would be a wake up call. And it was for a few days. Until my father pulled a gun out at a ski resort (he doesn’t live in my state, and now he’s in jail, thank god) and it brought back so many memories for me about his abuse, and how my mother and entire family just ignored it. Once, my therapist told him that he needed to stop hitting us, and he told me later, “Well, she doesn’t understand what it’s like to be your parent.” He kept doing it. Ever since he pulled the gun out, my whole family has been freaking out that he’s in jail and they feel so bad for him because he’s so sick (he was going on a manic phase) where I’m of the opinion that if he hadn’t been so violent for so many years, then when he was manic that’s the first thing that came out. (Most manic people are only a danger to themselves, not others or, if they are, it’s because of things like driving crazily or too fast, etc). But I think it means something about my dad that he pulled out a gun—he’s repressed his violence for so many years and he was only violent to my brother or I. He also solicited prostitutes. I am totally pro-sex work, and I don’t think of sex workers as victims unless they identify as that, but I am so freaked out about what he might have done to these women and how the woman he pulled a gun on must feel (she was an old lady who had called him crazy a few weeks before, um, because he fucking shouted her and he pulled his gun out weeks later — without a concealed carry permit I should add — on her to prove he’s not). It was so triggering to remember everything he did to me, and also what they let happen to me. When I was a kid I was molested by a close family friend. The friend asked if I wanted to stay the night one night at dinner when I was five, and I said I did, but only if he wouldn’t sleep naked anymore. Everyone laughed. I was five. How could they not see what was happening?! So, of course, after all of that I started to drink, especially because the only way I could communicate with my family was when I was drinking (I had to communicate to express that my dad SHOULD be in jail, that he should NOT be left alone with my mom and that she needs to put deadbolts on all the bedroom doors, because I didn't want something horrible to happen to her). Last week I went to the East coast and drank like a fish. And I walked along the harbor and kept telling myself to jump in but I didn’t want to because my friends were there and I didn’t want to drown in poisonous, polluted, black water. It was so scary; I was scared of myself. So I stopped drinking. Since I’ve stopped I’ve had a very slight, dull ache in my right side. On Friday, I’m going to go to the doctor and ask for an antidepressant on top of my mood stabilizer. The ache has gotten worse because of carrying my backpack. I’m going to tell the doctor what is going on. I feel so bad because I’ve been telling doctors how much I drank before I truly started to grieve, and I haven’t updated them on everything that has changed since I went to the hospital for suicidal ideation. I’m really ashamed at myself for lying. I’m also super ashamed of myself for writing an AWFUL paper for a prof I really admire. The only way I could stop getting myself to panic is to tell myself that she knows how my work normally is and how well I normally write, and the paper is past the point of laziness, but clearly demonstrates that something is wrong—because she’s been so supportive of losing my ex, I think she’ll understand that something was up. I’ll still get a bad grade but she won’t hold it against me. The last Friday before spring break and I went to the east coast, I almost collapsed in class because I’d been so upset and I was hungover. All my failures hit me at once. I told her I had low blood sugar and she helped me to my office and brought me my things. I was crying and I told the secretary I worked with about my dad, and how it was in the news, and that what he’d done made me physically sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I’m just putting this out there because I don’t know what to do. I know I can’t drink. To get myself through the day, I tell myself I can’t drink until I don’t want to drink anymore, which I feel like could take a while. I’m scared of what I’ve done to my body, but I think that I’ll be okay if I listen to it. I’ve just been extremely depressed and leaning on something awful to get me through it; it’s just terrifying the swathe of destruction it’s left behind me when in combination with my grief and trauma. Right now, I’m glad I didn’t kill myself. Super glad. But I still wish everything could go away and I could take a break.",4.647503486750352,4.951387920502093,5.406092050209208,84.6825829846583,69.37656903765689,8.515592747559275,28.904044630404464,8.406308959288992,1.8643085634588568,4595,155,966,64,75,1497,414,1195,0.229,0.6940000000000001,0.077,-0.9997,3,2,13,5,2,1,132.0,2,1,7,11,67,59,11,10,55,3,100,30,6,16,10,179,195,101,10,29,32,12,6,5,4,9,8,3,4,3,57,57,15,11,22,9,1,28,23,36,3,4,82,14,156,22,141,88,16,144,0,7,4,2,107,59,2,14,55,651,213,17,0.0,0.0960559245848546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04332014279895045,0.04059046752190239,0.08396514683644285,0.04473195384291554,0.09724872110400302,0.0,0.043920218536082065,0.04925509313094488,0.027565543340808667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08040068642094136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07579047784034662,0.0,0.03808445499893948,0.062338624906969564,0.10153639705406796,0.3212309945345119,0.0,0.17246370792881235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005164836300722,0.0,0.0,0.12417389292087785,0.04636183562097472,0.04132866376888968,0.04164114463778823,0.042881204904107496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19418588390597355,0.0,0.044526364864074006,0.05228411342645972,0.0,0.034913183622311834,0.0,0.12620840879182205,0.0,0.0,0.12446946580051778,0.0,0.12444573050543413,0.0,0.2779656401269457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04520781941929741,0.0,0.03666669816800714,0.0,0.03873342607613933,0.10929213377604434,0.0,0.1528531211880308,0.0,0.08198390663546881,0.02895858329175813,0.07784091124217225,0.0,0.0,0.03447949225243845,0.0,0.0,0.0939529256387731,0.03747443467677754,0.08471254376765856,0.0,0.13822361953350346,0.0,0.03241995800326691,0.0,0.04465444483908166,0.0,0.1075362782983914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027170104326545912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044846546585247664,0.042211505875209485,0.06683178440746082,0.09912557599943717,0.0,0.0,0.08808392127146286,0.04145031514236205,0.02863143626146335,0.0990180367081658,0.0,0.03579360643975649,0.0,0.06807925464184485,0.04534887783260255,0.04424930802840238,0.0,0.0,0.07671137748063812,0.0,0.1232899636770774,0.0,0.04415506422413415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0430017805059108,0.0,0.04747471062544305,0.03235506500228663,0.0430828422744308,0.08939481291754628,0.060113148298921164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607967836048228,0.07943240537749184,0.0,0.0,0.04253520899737303,0.08633801084610797,0.027467917139098786,0.15414544622885631,0.0,0.04755969836880068,0.09001979489029625,0.0,0.03869574013467021,0.028102225383167246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07663833649354909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08149878633952443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05193618363643495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045918841763869324,0.06923422448859028,0.03855856166705573,0.0,0.16233250633739402,0.0,0.03230156095878542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04160912834416136,0.13412560273681046,0.0,0.040564793853659686,0.0,0.0,0.15603111681880627,0.0,0.0,0.05738249879656755,0.04320547045638631,0.06474343660680261,0.1694475471723796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08867855849248615,0.04599922725877521,0.0,0.0,0.09143299806348923,0.0,0.17714915396841835,0.03731966031615737,0.0,0.0470648625144726,0.08078999410972515,0.12986762099145427,0.0,0.06436134937992746,0.023636587448724298,0.0,0.0,0.15493370430455733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439781090221743,0.0487592390553076,0.0,0.0,0.0334460488816478,0.1434533981462194,0.06435041734878455,0.09754544624159102,0.0,0.07289260045637723,0.18788416382198145,0.0,0.045256460011128194,0.04661384703523274,0.039074794367703135,0.0,0.0885310231033765,0.0,0.0413091575046552,0.028795270093159794,0.04431922729503447,0.04925509313094488,0.0522070912085922
addiction,scream_icecream,2019/03/20,"Addicted....F***! Hi Reddit community!

&amp;#x200B;

I know this might sound dumb to some but I believe I have an addiction to weed. I had been smoking almost everyday after work, I am also hooked on nicotine Juul pods.

I am not saying weed is bad, I really do believe some people need it. I personally use it as a way to escape, and its a cheaper alternative than going out. 

But I believe deep down I really do not need this stuff. I want to quit but I keep finding myself  buying more and more, I feel like weed and nicotine are controlling my life. 

I pray to my God every night to take this away from me, I have noticed I have been neglecting all my friends and family, I shut myself in my room because I just want to get high and distance myself from everyone. 

My family because I have some family issues I am too afraid to address and friends because they share the same vices. 

I know deep down what I must do, I just do not have the will power, I feel so trapped right now. I picture my future and it makes me sad because all I can see is my life deteriorating from these addictions. 

I feel like its been years since I've opened up to someone because I do not want people looking at me like some druggie addict... 

I feel so dumb getting into these vices, is it really a life long battle?

addiction,dennismiller2024,2019/03/20,"I think I’m addicted to getting hair cuts I got my first paycheck from my new job yesterday and...I went a little crazy. Long story short, I got four haircuts from four separate barbers. I don’t know why I did it, I wanted to treat myself but I think I went a little too far. The first haircut was $25 including the tip, and this was not a lot of money for me because I just got my paycheck. I was in a good mood so I went to another high rated barber and got another haircut, and then another, and then another. It added up quickly, and now I have spent my entire paycheck in one day and my hair is as short as it can be without being bald.

I’m fine with the money I have now, I’ll be able to make it to my next paycheck, but I feel depressed and empty knowing that all of the money that I worked so hard for went to waste on four haircuts. I guess it hurts even more knowing that I could have just gotten an extra short haircut the first time and not paid for the other three haircuts. Also, I didn’t even use one of my haircuts to shave my facial hair, so I almost went to a fifth barber for the shave before I realized that I had spent my entire paycheck.

I made this post for two reasons. First is what I think everyone here can learn from my experience. Just because you have more money than you did before does not mean that you can spend it on useless things. I know millionaires that don’t even get two haircuts in a day, let alone four. Even Jeff Bezos, the richest bald person in the world, doesn’t get haircuts just because he can afford them, I doubt he gets haircuts at all. That’s probably a factor in how he made all of his money, by not spending it on needless things.

Looking back at my day yesterday, I am still not sure why I purchased four haircuts from four separate barbers, and because I don’t know why I did it I am worried that next time I get a paycheck I may get 5 or even 6 haircuts in one day. What can I do to budget myself better or curb this possible addiction?",5.392531283138922,4.8971966560975595,6.184125132555675,82.47566808059385,67.8048780487805,8.788971367974549,31.240721102863198,8.04050195162591,2.071594909862142,1559,55,323,17,23,515,173,410,0.08900000000000001,0.8690000000000001,0.042,-0.9459,3,1,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,3,1,6,21,11,1,1,18,0,32,8,6,6,4,54,70,22,0,2,14,0,5,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,24,10,0,1,13,0,12,5,11,5,0,16,23,6,52,5,40,41,7,49,0,3,1,0,9,20,0,7,23,230,76,3,0.07557754329456247,0.0,0.0,0.1647813557109055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567999245599419,0.0782755418586839,0.0,0.06043933406724731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169985754869701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0581144656701825,0.0,0.18428547562788025,0.0,0.1286218455891644,0.0,0.0,0.06684219530013033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0603425185200391,0.0,0.0,0.19496505220333893,0.0,0.06509482729474764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0661384174451483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495912727863585,0.0,0.0,0.07221758142241884,0.0,0.07392933953562637,0.0,0.0,0.03821427674082145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2571448788701959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2369168821400658,0.0,0.0,0.06339085756322453,0.24178506205053896,0.0,0.08325718462653277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06770263384955344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07985182398576976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090732322875928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499904991361289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20767720635590486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07728315855391063,0.0,0.0,0.15149710662836707,0.0,0.06688374752909745,0.06346610167675952,0.0,0.0,0.06425332463051271,0.0,0.14302659770772513,0.050448597018362094,0.0,0.0,0.08232610096381061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07299326226736977,0.16075514940460406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15363989789576896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599139564307102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08520232433007065,0.07238239491361176,0.0,0.08148537443218921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770630192887096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06035632370253021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07123094013163961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10042072302558286,0.14528111416713047,0.0,0.0,0.08813974654712545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14765655590446644,0.0,0.0,0.06527473149946778,0.0,0.0,0.044577593181759086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3503056990653237,0.2045909324654196,0.0,0.0,0.0728540547450364,0.0,0.0550213516426378,0.07675266383688234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Because there was nothing to pick up inside the army I pick up reading, five years later I am addicted to reading and junk food. I sit and read at least 8 hours every day but only entertaining books no professional or self help. It really affects my life. I cant stop. There are times that I go without sleep for 2-3 days. I rarely go outside and do healthy activities. When out with friends after 3-4 hours I miss reading. When I read I feel like I am light headed like when you masturbate. My life is going to ruination and don't know what to do. I no longer enjoy TV, movies, youtube.When I go to the cinema, 40 minutes into the movie I am desperate to leave.

addiction,hole1234567,2019/03/20,"Need to be high everyday and its starting to affect my life. Yo yall, sorry might be long post.
I’m 18 still in school. I’ve been smoking weed for past 3 years daily almost always bymyself. For the past 6 months maybe more, I’ve been doing Xanax and Valium daily, mainly xan. It’s only been like half a year but the withdrawals are still fucked. Im a loner and have very few friends etc.
I live with my mum and stepdad, and I have to constantly lie to my family so that I can get high. I don’t tell anyone I do Xanax anymore as it’s easier just to say I quit. My family have no idea but they are noticing a change in me and have been bringing it up a lot recently.
I have about 3, 2mg xan bars a day now. If I can’t get any benzos on a day then I will make up for it by drinking a lot, but it doesn’t work the same. I try to stop but it gets harder and harder. I have A level exams in 2 months, and after that university depending on results. I hope University will help me get out of my mindset, but I need to pass my exams. This is my motivation for passing exams, but with Benzos I can’t be fucked, and when I’m of them I can’t be fucked. 
Basically I need to get out my mind set as I always want to feel high. I want to quit and just go back to smoking weed, but it’s hard. The few friends I have seemed to be getting further away, so I just told them I quit Xanax completely as it’s just easier. I don’t know who to ask for advice, friends don’t know, they wouldn’t understand if they did. Family I can’t tell because my mum would probably kick me out the house.

addiction,cadabamsgroup,2019/03/20,"All you need to know about Bhang Addiction  

Holi is almost there and no doubt it is the festival of spirit and colours in India. For most of the people, it is incomplete without Bhang. So We simply call it the festival of ***‘Rang Aur bhang’*** in Hindi. But there is something beyond you should know about what is Bhang actually is, what it does to you and how it can lead to Bhang Addiction. 

## What is Bhang?

Bhang is the preparation made from the Cannabis sativa plant, that is usually used in the food and drinks during Holi. Though many say it’s okay to have bhang that it is safe, but it isn’t so. Bhang does have some hallucinogenic, physical as well as psychological effects on the mind and body. Bhang overdose can also lead to Bhang addiction. Yes, you heard it right.

Bhang is addictive and its overdose can cause a number of difficulties and [bhang side effects](http://www.cadabams.org/blog/bhang-side-effects-treatment/). In order to overcome, you need to get an effective Bhang Side Effects Treatment. But, how will you know whether or not you are addicted to it? Check for these symptoms.

## Is bhang addictive?

Yes, bhang is addictive in nature. Excess use of Bhang can cause a number of problems. An effective Bhang Side Effects Treatment can help to overcome it.

## Symptoms of Bhang Addiction to see in yourself or a loved one

Several symptoms of bhang addiction may include the following:

* Red or Bloodshot eyes
* A constant mucus-filled cough
* Dry mouth
* Rapid heartbeat
* Irritability
* Poor memory and concentration
* Paranoia
* Anxiety  
* Loss of control
* Poor decision-making skills and coordination.

Bhang can have a number of effects on the body. Below listed are a few of them-

### Bhang Effects

📷

* Change in the perception, due to a small hallucinogenic effect that can create a distorted illusion of space and time
* Change in the mood, leading to feelings of low energy,  euphoria, or a state of relaxation
* Higher heart rate
* A reduction in the blood pressure
* Cognitive impairment of memory and concentration  
* Reduced psychomotor coordination
* Feeling of nausea
* A increase in appetite
* Sleep issues such as Insomnia
* Psychosis

Thinking of trying the bhang for yourself this Holi? One advice: move with caution! Bhang drink is not for the faint of heart. You can try this intoxicating.

### Treatments for Bhang addiction

* **Medication for Bhang addiction treatment** can play a role in a successful recovery. Medications cannot be used alone though. The most effective substance abuse treatment programs will use drug abuse preventative medication as well as several types of counselling and therapy. Medication can better make treatment more successful when combined with the right types of counselling.

**Psychotherapy**:

* **Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)** is an effective treatment method that helps the individual to manage their thinking patterns, essentially controlling their negative thought behaviours that may lead to drug abuse.
* **Motivational enhancement therapy (MET)** is often used in Bhang addiction treatment. Usually, a therapist helps the person to tap and improve their motivation to resist the use of drugs.
* **Family therapy**, In addition to these, recovering individuals benefit from family therapy. Since the family members often serve as a core support system for persons once they exit a rehabilitation centre. It’s important that family people understand the recovery process of individual so that they can serve as the best source of support and help along with substance abuse care provided.  
* **Group Therapy** helps the person with addiction behaviour to learn and share their emotions with other peers who have similar problems.
* **Individual therapy** is a solution-oriented approach that focuses on helping the person maintain abstinence from drug abuse. Individual counselling is essential for success, and this should be provided several times a week.
* **Relapse Prevention**– To prevent the individual from relapse after recovery, a set of relapse prevention tools and techniques are provided that can help them fight and prevent from getting back to their addiction habit after a recovery process.",5.193804533789563,8.752137681137729,5.30164029084688,67.67556137724551,89.10479041916166,9.15218135158255,33.209794696321644,8.867292932012656,4.760671685201029,3353,182,443,113,112,1051,298,668,0.1,0.71,0.19,0.9966,0,1,8,0,6,0,160.0,1,8,9,25,20,27,1,2,48,3,47,41,8,30,1,101,76,42,0,6,11,0,2,0,0,6,29,3,0,4,32,26,3,7,23,4,3,8,7,7,2,2,4,9,18,19,93,64,8,50,1,2,4,1,39,27,0,14,11,294,50,14,0.0,0.2489562339116975,0.04100909725153904,0.641368941620919,0.0,0.04106510135741303,0.0,0.0,0.042080694015041366,0.043523909278032034,0.0,0.033606360688204016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032148037459782265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0323136534287654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04410131065142635,0.03716657304576194,0.0,0.09335777811056377,0.0,0.0,0.04291092557499628,0.0,0.04284599218204972,0.0863398907634322,0.08891106571228118,0.0,0.0,0.045412721561527584,0.09426637025740324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.073550496421275,0.0,0.0,0.0823345111232299,0.1949367347360832,0.0,0.0,0.04727103858984458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15846492574855908,0.0,0.04249691984236588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05081525959727157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04391132759925854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09959664177936113,0.1971733368514749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04386185469391024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06928542689517078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037928055901032716,0.03976386822217829,0.028051165251532468,0.04260546505425339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693379423280414,0.0,0.0,0.042431986405901706,0.0,0.0,0.044664573081607165,0.0,0.062320124755467436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04475389959874148,0.056952732349644715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05826792445062064,0.1467739960093856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08042206594550272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177606945524792,0.0,0.03341895580060806,0.0,0.0,0.0334874709728682,0.0,0.0,0.14242455568188753,0.0,0.03476246267245624,0.0,0.04205407777128952,0.0,0.0,0.0323519194753519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09537605873400637,0.0,0.13103623426820515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3364045735050428,0.04879278804223759,0.0,0.05385421706171687,0.08257620023590645,0.033362146521107194,0.0490087483448093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570627066048079,0.0,0.0,0.043748183661584526,0.0,0.21777005366962296,0.09256640027220336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033708900360559964,0.0,0.0755687579629463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04050937488218696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,tipitz,2019/03/20,"Making a documentary feature on addiction Dear everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my friends from the production company Fasad are in the pre-production phase of our next feature documentary film project, which will explore the topic of addiction as a societal phenomenon. I've been reading some very moving personal stories of addiction in this thread and we're wondering if anybody would like to participate in an interview (on Skype or in the flesh) for research purposes (you will not be shown in the film) on the topic. The aim of the film will be to highlight addiction as a public health issue and ultimately to push leaders to make better decisions to counteract this social disease. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have you experienced addiction or are you currently experiencing it? There's no specific addiction we're looking for, so everything from tv-games to heroine addiction is welcome. The only criteria are that you yourself have been/are addicted to something so that it has a severe impact on your life and that you want to share your story with us.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to be a part of this, please message me here on reddit or email me and we'll move on from there! 

Thank you in advance!

addiction,greenmuhfuckingoblin,2019/03/21,"Ever feel like the temptation is eating away at you? It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even care about making excuses to justify a relapse. I just want to relapse.


The past few years that I’ve been addicted to drugs were usually spent with me abusing meth and other stims and dissociatives.

I had taken them before, but never heavy. This year I ended up getting into benzos super heavy after realizing how much they help with my anxiety. It was like a cure. Took the tension away that I felt I my chest when I was anxious and also took away the “deer in the headlights” feeling that I would get on occasion when having conversations with strangers. I never expected this, but somehow I found them way more addictive than the meth or any other stim or any dissos I had abused

My main doc out of benzos was etizolam. I used kpins and Xanax some as well but I  preferred etizolam and was able to get a fuck ton of it way easier and pretty much spent every day for a few months taking 6-12 mg a day. I started low but the tolerance built so fucking fast. I ended up having to withdraw cold turkey off them after my landlords (fam) ransacked my house and flushed every pill. 

It’s been a little over a month since I’ve taken benzos, and it’s still fucking eating at me. I have Days where I feel fine and actually have less anxiety than when I even took them, and no cravings either. But, then there are days where I don’t even want to leave the house. Hell its not even just anxiety, I just feel weird as fuck sometimes. It’s hard to explain but I just sorta don’t feel “there”. Kinda like a zoned out feeling. 

Today has been the worst day so far. I have no idea why but I feel really fucking fiendish. I can’t get it off my mind and one second I tell myself nope and the next I’m planning on using it. The constant inconsistency is killing me, and sorta seems out of my control at times. Anybody else feel this way??

addiction,DoomedButDetermined,2019/03/21,"Anyone ever just find themselves realising, 'Why did I even do that?' Hello everyone!  Hope you're good...

I'm on a drug reduction with the goal of complete sobriety and I'm wondering if anybody recognises what I'm experiencing as just poor impulse control or something else?

Today for example I had a group meeting with other addicts (similar to NA) which I really didn't want to miss.  But this morning I was groggy and drained not to mention running late so that it would have been a close call to make it on time (cut-off time is 15 minutes after session begins).  

I'd like to imagine that usually I could just plough through it and stomach it.  However instead I just let them know I wouldn't be able to make it.  When really, and addicts will relate, I just didn't have the mental strength to do/deal with it.

But when my head had leveled out and cleared I just thought to myself how stupid that was, that I absolutely could have gone and now everything is thrown off because I didn't go.  Then afterwards I just kind of pissed around most of the day until it was too late to go anywhere really...  

What I'm getting that is, this is happening more and more often, either that or I'm noticing it more.  Having what I lovingly call Time Skips or Blackouts (except I remember exactly what happened and what I was doing but almost immediately after in hindsight I don't know why I didn't use that time more productively).

I just feel like I'm unintentionally, almost subconsciously, wasting time without wanting to only to realise hours later that I've been doing it the entire time. It's like I'm a Chronic Time Waster.  - I'm a freelance artist and can edit a picture to the best of my ability only to realise that even though I've been doing it all day I've hardly made a dent when I was giving it all I had?

Can ANYONE identify with this?  This kind of treading through a road, littered with quicksand fills potholes that once you fall in will use up hours of your time.  And you won't realise how long it has even been until you finally pull your leg back out and look around? 

I'd love to hear that I'm not alone, and to finally make some friends on here for the first time?

________________________________________________

Head's up, I'm just gonna be a gaping asshole rn because I've gotta come out with it...

addiction,PCprincesscarolyn,2019/03/21,"My SO completed 28 days of rehab for alcohol addiction, fell apart soon after. Less than 4 days after being released, he’s now in a worse state of mind than ever. He’s been drinking dangerous amounts of alcohol and experiencing intense negative thoughts about himself and his life in general. 

He’s an amazing person inside and out-well educated, creative, funny, talented, and extremely loving. He hates himself so much right now and keeps expressing how much turmoil he is in. He will (hopefully) have his first session with a therapist today. His mental health is clearly at an all time low. I call/text him throughout the day to keep in touch in a positive manner, and have visiting at night after work. 

What is the next step? What else can be done to help him heal? (Besides entering rehab again) I’m scared he’s going to hurt himself with the amount he drinks.

addiction,Harissssss,2019/03/21,"How can I help my video game addicted friend? Currently i am [M/16] and my friend [M/16] , who i have been best friends with since all my life, is addicted to video games.

It is to the extent that in the last 2 weeks, he has spent just over a week straight on 1 game. 177h in 2 school weeks. ( he confirmed that its “probably accurate”)

Heres his situation- he is 16 living with his parents ofc, goes to college for about 15h a week then goes home and plays video games. I personally have a couple hobbies and a part time job, and have tried to encourage him to try new things in order to give him a purpose as currently he has no aspirations at all, which worries me. He also doesn’t try in school what so ever (no revision etc). 

He has had extremely laid back parents since the get go. I remember him at 8 years old refusing to eat lunch at the dinner table in order to play xbox on the sofa instead, his parents “were forced” to allowed this. Recently his dad split from his mum (3 years ago) and he claims to be ok with it as he sees his dad on a Friday night. 

The thing that strikes me is that i had no idea how bad his addiction was. Considering he spends 10h a day on a game, id have though he would’ve mentioned it to me maybe once? However i have heard nothing about it in the last 2 weeks, meaning he is hiding his addiction.
Usually me or one of my other friends start the conversations in group chats etc, he is never the first to start a conversation.

I am scared that he is going to waste his life away staring at a computer screen for the rest of his life, as thats all he currently has done.

Is there any way i can help him?
Also apologies if this is badly explained/formatted.",6.217209150326794,5.356705335294119,6.665490196078434,80.91748366013077,66.23529411764707,10.496732026143787,32.124183006535944,9.861636050157227,2.7104575163398703,1314,45,282,25,18,429,182,340,0.085,0.8170000000000001,0.098,0.6848,9,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,0,2,14,12,0,1,20,1,30,10,0,3,5,23,40,17,0,1,3,6,0,0,4,0,7,1,2,1,19,8,3,1,3,12,2,2,5,3,0,2,8,4,31,9,43,31,9,50,0,0,3,0,57,18,0,2,27,177,50,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3851015690458632,0.0,0.0,0.07828511100792468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14124948954916042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0600566086910866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08297399339480993,0.06790808285711929,0.14747715025691605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09268018747637602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771785931405373,0.0,0.05695528112744906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903759746704854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09036736031022312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1969871072066016,0.0,0.07988514924754556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511991867784097,0.0,0.0,0.27292498322799363,0.0,0.04614046628231242,0.08471892108584954,0.10038186354072813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11839014406218465,0.0,0.08858623159177118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969585644134353,0.0,0.0,0.08763810588302455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14397553872418656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18713655768281853,0.0,0.0,0.07798295825400371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08872337225437735,0.0961999326859932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811326954634545,0.0852942971238097,0.0,0.08287678962371531,0.0,0.08473974988963097,0.0,0.09267077999391532,0.09405162213645277,0.059843912045800175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2941870324849435,0.0956355518468264,0.0,0.0,0.0771124557630736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09521752449706583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08719950823623644,0.0,0.1000426466210088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841780924117823,0.17875714512601504,0.0703748945786659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14610865346332136,0.09926873584124504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12501833297224993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173439125895983,0.0,0.0867681436889796,0.0,0.05149665528628177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17987840728284538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09726549171122653,0.0,0.0,0.07009961287617213,0.3542011743973117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968724387693851,0.0,0.06273579471146801,0.0,0.0,0.11374275517989152
addiction,throwaway61922,2019/03/21,"Today is the first day I’ve finally come to grips with the fact that I have a problem and I don’t think I can shake it off on my own Been laying awake in my bed for almost an hour now and it’s really started to dawn on me. I have a problem and I have for quite some time. As of late I have been struggling with my adderall consumption. It sounds so bizarre to say or even type but I think I’ve finally accepted the fact that I have a problem. 

I started taking the stuff freshman year of college to help me through the stressful exams and essays and over time it just grew. Before I knew it I was taking them weekly at parties, staying up all night, then just taking more to get through the day. Then it progressed onto cocaine since that always seemed to be present at parties I attended. I didn’t try the stuff for the longes time but once I did i knew I enjoyed it. I kept it in moderation at first but slowly that habit grew out of my control as well.

However, I had the ability to release it was getting to be a problem and I stopped doing the stuff almost cold turkey. Been about a year or so since I stopped that but I feel like the only reason I got off that so well is because the adderall does something similar. I’ve recently quit smoking pot as well after years of use and now adderall is the last thing I have to kick. I’ve been able to stop all the others on my own but this addiction has spanned for almost 3 years. I thought I could get past this one by myself as well but tonight was the night I realized I can’t.

Not sure why I posted about this but I honestly just don’t share any of this kind of stuff with those close to me. Probably a nice piece of the issue there but I figured this was at least a start. Hoping to maybe get some advice or support from a random Reddit soul who knows. Just happy with myself for beginning to acknowledge that I have a problem.

addiction,hjcc10131013,2019/03/21,"Getting over an addict? I dated this guy who was in active addiction for the past year. I don’t use at all and never have. We were so close and he relied on me for everything. I thought he’d love me forever like he promised but he got sober and left me and is now sleeping around and wants nothing to do with me. I’m having such a hard time letting go and I don’t know what to do. I try my best to get over it but I constantly worry about him relapsing and dying and have nightmares about it every night. Does anyone have any advice for me?
 I can’t stop thinking about how perfect we were before he got strung out and how crazy our connection was but he doesn’t feel it anymore. I just don’t know what to do and how to live my own life when I’ve been so dedicated to saving his.

addiction,OneEaredElephant0,2019/03/21,"Losing the Peanutbutter to my Jelly, to drugs. I am peanutbutter and she is my jelly. She is my hero. I have learned so much from her about life, and what it really means to be to close to someone and love them unconditionally. Some background, I am 21, she is 29.

She has struggled with addiction the past few years, and I’ve slowly seen my hero crumble. I miss her so much. Her involvement with drugs has gotten worse lately. She told me she needed space to deal with this, and I’m giving it to her. But I miss her dearly. It’s been a few months since we’ve seen eachother.  She will probably miss my graduation.  I’m just grieving and I hope she gets better some day so we can watch the clouds together again. 

I don’t think I’m looking for advice, maybe just some kindness or support. I don’t want people to tell me to forget about her. I am grieving. I don’t know what I need right now but I guess I wanted Reddit to know it’s been hard for me. I hope she’s proud of me for getting through school.

addiction,MNightengale,2019/03/22,"AA Alternatives? I made the decision to quit drinking and drugs back in 2015. I went all in to AA and even though I wasn’t experiencing any kind of spiritual connection, I really liked it. Plus my life just naturally got better when I wasn’t drunk or hungover 24/7. I got a sponsor, started on the steps, meetings, etc. I had a few relapses but was doing really well until I developed a chronic illness. I felt absolutely awful all the time and it made it really difficult to attend meetings (or do anything that involved leaving my house) and resulted in a shit ton of anxiety and depression that I’m still struggling with. Furthermore, I had to be placed on a slew of mood-altering meds that I experienced issues with. Honestly, even taking them as prescribed seemed to cause problems, if that makes sense. After I got done screwing with my meds and was hospitalized for psychiatric issues twice, I got back into AA, got a new sponsor, went to meetings as best I could and put a lot of hard work into the steps....and nada. I kept waiting for those 9th Step promises and the “Spiritual Experience” everyone talks about. I prayed my ass off, literally begging for some kind of relationship. I’m not a religious person but I do believe there is a power greater than me-I just feel like whatever that is doesn’t give a crap- about me or anyone else and doesn’t intervene much or make their presence felt. After trying to “fake it till I make it” and praying my ass off for over a year I just gave up. Maybe it’s just because of the awful toll the health problems and anxiety/depression but I just don’t get it. I also don’t like a lot of messages in AA and disagree with parts of the literature. The whole powerless concept made me feel like I’m not capable of living a good life without the assistance of some deity and I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of time waiting on some miracle to occur. I believe people should take credit for their hard work and success and not ascribe solely to anything outside themselves. I’m still working on a spiritual path because I truly want it, which makes it all the more frustrating that all the work didn’t get me anywhere. I feel like I’m still engaging in some typical addict thoughts and behaviors and  while I have no plans to drink, I’m scared I might succumb in a moment of weakness and desperation. Other than SMART recovery (which I’m looking into) what else is effective?",6.16051724137931,6.841364950216452,6.969423794596209,73.47019480519482,66.16450216450217,10.268517689207345,34.54575309747724,10.245366335075165,3.652933034781311,1925,86,344,45,29,640,227,462,0.185,0.667,0.14800000000000002,-0.965,2,0,3,0,0,0,47.0,0,0,3,11,19,30,4,2,28,2,23,16,4,10,4,82,64,35,0,6,17,0,8,6,0,2,8,0,0,1,20,26,3,3,10,3,1,6,12,12,5,1,23,11,38,18,60,37,20,41,2,1,1,3,13,18,5,14,23,238,58,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233970321263435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060401940595722965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051363523112443764,0.0,0.05778084294609225,0.0,0.0,0.052812880280566334,0.07739021391988764,0.12431079901845213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161570211629705,0.0,0.0920857296272055,0.0,0.0,0.17019465723082056,0.07926489782322624,0.06680084041485314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07759092097652459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06030518494774202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13010910699219316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729421565700334,0.0,0.14798282670306595,0.08759172988631601,0.0,0.126192556098669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423678970871852,0.09977474083535436,0.0,0.0,0.07217290081638382,0.0,0.07388359987460259,0.0,0.0,0.15276253514238908,0.21583682843760135,0.1450427947038502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892343433845023,0.07245601035577891,0.0,0.0633516380009349,0.30204433876332315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532149323169929,0.0,0.0,0.0802856913062338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715238366258916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15766902975422326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15730737688182084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799761943650721,0.0,0.0,0.10669925275740934,0.22140315483552425,0.0,0.06669506597116158,0.0,0.0634268355613657,0.0,0.0,0.1926407143942921,0.0,0.21440716195031645,0.20166953903563795,0.0,0.07588082445417899,0.0,0.16779534743142446,0.0,0.0,0.0801262256863168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05552381684934195,0.0,0.0,0.07294810175201685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08179247854174675,0.0,0.05236353534314443,0.06595056714269268,0.078913593266855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14454551907284108,0.0,0.07592929956125934,0.0,0.0803362859448311,0.0,0.0,0.14516086272638068,0.0,0.0,0.08109179530102592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561949113495195,0.0,0.0,0.0687603889240388,0.0,0.0,0.07753126426606738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0534610775987122,0.0,0.18095694476713625,0.0,0.0,0.07896117482289441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11357949914042413,0.06070878304298676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07420861169029339,0.05996300554558544,0.08808521498827329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051280444296733715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04455001327891946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06791124560792756,0.14003558677032638,0.0,0.08432742286373436,0.0,0.07280898035658416,0.0,0.21994924098384303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04863934845710389

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 30 year old Australian with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, ADD, PTSD and I'm 47 days clean today! It's the longest I've been clean and sober in 14 years! I've recently got out of rehab and I'm back living with my (very supportive) parents until I can get back on my feet.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been abusing various drugs over the years including prescription Opiates &amp; Benzos, Cocaine, Alcohol, Weed, but the one I'm finding hardest to cope without is Dexamphetamine. I've been prescribed some sort of stimulant for 20 years and been abusing Dex for 10. Every morning I wake up, I crave it and this morning, for whatever reason, I'm craving it bad. I'm terrified of going back into the 9-5 work life and not having them. I've been prescribe Modafinil to help the cravings but it's crazy expensive ($100/month) and doesn't quite do the job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for answers, I just want to reach out, connect and vent. Have a happy, healthy weekend everyone!",4.280114045618248,6.532321357142862,4.980960384153661,79.88672869147662,72.6734693877551,8.081152460984391,33.97839135654261,8.841846274778883,3.2735849939975994,830,44,142,17,17,267,124,196,0.145,0.764,0.091,-0.8974,2,0,3,0,0,0,45.0,0,0,1,2,4,5,0,0,8,0,11,6,2,2,0,27,24,11,0,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,1,6,14,1,0,3,1,1,1,4,3,0,1,6,1,7,2,21,18,3,21,0,1,1,0,5,7,0,2,13,72,13,2,0.0,0.2405239266288377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847358862202244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4399047103591464,0.3700040926426699,0.0,0.0,0.07764790704116689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23414376949785845,0.16949801566631562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545968047254866,0.0,0.08742257234257174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23265763914861004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770881408104555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08551888194042677,0.09698845513054144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09276997940886708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0530300284698086,0.0,0.05768529785597204,0.0,0.08117953820952828,0.0,0.0,0.10050184423915616,0.0,0.10804959038826263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06803391053472192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10072397668418134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169308404862593,0.0,0.0,0.08962715008268132,0.0,0.08523518835090621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08101704620839494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10650811526975333,0.0,0.06877963348086168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11270473234688196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11864911486522756,0.0,0.0,0.10795869608369436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10435982526062527,0.10021988889378812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11518201308238052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962109805027416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08374886860963478,0.059867857812175414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09784324094691214,0.0,0.07389386060714995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3700040926426699,0.26145299479716577
addiction,nagreiner,2019/03/22,"Is weed addictive in the sense that other drugs are? Does weed have the potential to permanently change a persons brain chemistry into becoming an addict the way opiates, alcohol, and other « hard drugs » do? I’ve been told my whole life by adults and peers that a person can get addicted to weed, however I’m having a hard time understanding how that can be due to the fact that if I go a while without smoking I don’t feel the withdrawal symptoms that say a heroin addict feels. Someone please help me understand this, thanks!

addiction,esightes,2019/03/22,"Survey Request: People Who Use Drugs  IRB Protocol #1812578936

A team of researchers at Indiana University in Indianapolis are looking to better understand the willingness of people who use drugs to use a drug testing card that can tell you if your drugs are contaminated with unwanted substances.

**To be eligible for study participation you must**:

1). Be 18 years or older

2). Have used an illicit drug in the past 12 months. Illicit drugs include those that are illegal to make, sell, or use, as well as prescription medication not prescribed to you. *Those who solely use marijuana are not eligible.*

Eligible participants are invited to complete a brief online survey that is ***completely anonymous***

If interested, please visit the following link: [https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_201uPmnDjsZReaV](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_201uPmnDjsZReaV)

Participants will be entered in a drawing to win one of five $20 Visa gift cards. Five of the people who complete the survey and click the link at the end of the survey to confidentially submit their contact information will be randomly chosen to win! If 200 people respond to the survey, you will have a 1-in-40 chance of winning.

Additionally, you will have the opportunity to participate in a focus group and training regarding use of a drug testing card. There will be a space at the end of the survey for you to indicate your interest in participating. Those who participate will be given payment as a thank you for your time.

We thank you in advance for your interest in participating in our research study!

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to Emily Sightes ([esightes@iu.edu](mailto:esightes@iu.edu))

For general information about participant rights, you may contact the Indiana University Institutional Review Board at (812) 856-4242 or via email at [irb@iu.edu](mailto:irb@iu.edu)",7.732525438406582,11.526862815436239,7.759703399004112,56.55105758822256,68.49664429530202,10.28811431045681,34.44511799090712,10.237710317436264,4.820297553583028,1541,74,205,48,31,495,156,298,0.018000000000000002,0.836,0.146,0.9885,0,0,7,0,0,0,88.0,2,14,1,7,3,12,0,0,23,0,25,8,0,8,1,35,39,13,0,6,10,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,11,6,0,0,6,1,2,5,2,0,1,3,1,3,17,11,45,24,0,28,0,0,3,0,35,16,0,11,7,138,28,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570282019725881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07416803965680348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2637792778045223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6807631159772454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485515089895235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07042192921535367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055977717779725315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08448090712132401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06693686966275082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05682623074060132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800545977489163,0.23255400631380246,0.0,0.0,0.18410789368798813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939432592276764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07161664271833293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07329801271740649,0.15441546714643992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04889989166195939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08730202315748653,0.0,0.5070014826549539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07540090702618993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0540035889196005
addiction,Wannabefisherman37,2019/03/22,"An old friend of mine appears to be knocking on my door It is stupid how I am unwilling to stop my behavioral pattern run it's course over and over again. Started off by going to a wedding in September. Was fine, nothing terrible happened. Ended up drinking smoking weed for 4 days straight. But that's not something I would call problematic from where I was coming from. So a 4 day bender is something that I reckon is progress from old times. Then I lost my job in December. Not because of drug use, but because of video game addiction. I can't really hold up a job, I am constantly running away from any uncomfortable emotion that I imagine could possibly light up every now and then. So I start to imagine the worst, which makes me anxious. I start to look over my life and think about the opportunities I've flushed down the toilet. My entire life seems like something I actively tried to destroy every step of the way.  


I know this is self pity, I'm aware that it's self made and it's just thoughts. I do know that what I need to do is change my perspective on life and myself. But that would be way outside my comfort zone. That would be so far away from my comfort zone that I can't even imagine giving that a try. Plus, everything never works out for me. Things always go sour.  


Lately I've been thinking deeply about killing myself. I used to talk about these things with my friends and family. I used to share what I was feeling, but these days I just tell people that I'm fine and that nothing's wrong. I don't want people to worry and I most certainly don't want to tell people about my deteriorating will to live. If I tell people that they'll get more worried. Tell me not to do it, try to talk me off of it.  


It's weird because last night I genuinely felt like my only option to have some dignity for myself would be by killing myself.  


Right now I'm awaiting some cocaine, xanax and amphetamine. Don't really have any money, but drug dealers have computer issues as well it seems. Thank god for my computer addiction.  


I read a lot. I really like Robert Sapolsky and to think about mankind and how free will is most likely just a fairy tale. We're just dragged forward by some natural impulses that are activated through our environment and genes. The thing is that can now excuse me and my addiction how ever. Because I know what I have to do to fix this, I know that I can actually get better. Momentarily. Which is the issue, pulling yourself up that rope once again only to lose your grip and hit the concrete again seems like a waste of time. I wish I could cry, I wish I could get over these emotions in some healthy manner. But all that's left is being able to tell jokes and attempt my best at not dropping the mask that hides the misery that lies within.  


I haven't spoken or written to anyone about this in quite some time. I don't want to. But I felt some urge to share here. Not looking for understanding or any help. Just wanted to write something.  


Being depressed locked in a room playing video games on drugs is my comfort zone. To justify that comfort zone I have to be a fucked up loser who can never do anything. If I thought something else this wouldn't make any sense.",3.74686274509804,5.540519019108281,4.300569501686027,86.1617278631198,72.98089171974522,7.154789559135756,27.122642687648312,7.861635385654353,1.5690778318970904,2536,93,502,35,51,803,286,628,0.14,0.705,0.155,0.611,2,0,10,0,0,2,58.0,1,1,1,10,28,38,5,0,19,0,55,12,0,9,5,103,106,36,2,17,21,0,4,5,2,8,10,0,2,2,44,19,1,2,20,8,2,9,15,14,1,0,11,8,66,25,80,76,13,71,0,5,2,1,25,32,1,18,34,333,110,6,0.061073236728118874,0.0,0.059598669126331535,0.1997365283459116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050817825432782696,0.0,0.0,0.16612758106258385,0.0,0.0,0.06899537369708081,0.0,0.042703827143784526,0.0,0.0502580700502252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11476063262816567,0.0,0.0,0.1489187129926894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06409259402688458,0.05401431482208177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0623626030966303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460738643615106,0.05260918564732196,0.0,0.06599847223825757,0.0,0.1462860298587023,0.0,0.06708608276757477,0.11816155568046804,0.0,0.05260228930243835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059828521169500826,0.21247669540568714,0.0,0.0510188525397739,0.13739834217240499,0.0540927602440642,0.0,0.0,0.04033829686350883,0.055244239129372825,0.10291367202108262,0.0,0.05488868714619576,0.0,0.057574412208394994,0.0,0.030880463535177493,0.0,0.11727976964293353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437006239486123,0.05646122323412028,0.09572473645666306,0.05858701372324138,0.06941865573176531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05400686154121382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04093610321027959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274891836382223,0.12121152739527133,0.0,0.13513697537367514,0.0,0.1342570148106002,0.04978283926973835,0.06889327119226613,0.0,0.06635625040298007,0.0,0.12941349975377228,0.14918649268506626,0.0,0.053928786944495134,0.0,0.10257227432780196,0.06832532996982348,0.06666865237850238,0.05192228186663355,0.0,0.05778897328123245,0.08153371951494935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04528503117772748,0.09420689042068348,0.0,0.0,0.05731309545482166,0.0,0.11720283558986655,0.0,0.12817217664387484,0.06504100390062488,0.0,0.09289789719436473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16936197003850387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06885089798851328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06495890491365804,0.061089764013334914,0.0,0.11737523795290952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05215621046731738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1667963429007698,0.12742541097086982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2350858070084508,0.0,0.0,0.12968385389516054,0.0,0.0,0.0510599605832215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981767085379432,0.2669035040612519,0.05622803093112047,0.0,0.0,0.12172303416598736,0.11739979219849005,0.0,0.09697065603076838,0.10683688642237743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12439415635753535,0.0,0.0,0.06357939329734717,0.0,0.15824300270097064,0.0,0.0,0.14409030950098234,0.09695418517921088,0.0,0.0,0.05491217441945085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14046241636239293,0.0,0.0,0.04446204371680937,0.1240456729257272,0.0,0.17353870037956104,0.06677399692487727,0.0,0.0
addiction,randomchick20,2019/03/22,"My mom is addicted to methadone and Xanax I’m not sure what to do anymore. For as long as I can remember my mom has been an addict. (I’m 24 now). When I was about 13, she detoxed and went to rehab and then was put on suboxone to prevent relapse. She then later switched to methadone for a bunch of reasons and has been on it since. She takes methadone and Xanax together, she trades one for the other with other addicts she met in rehab. It’s all a joke to her. She’s a narcissist and even when she’s sober she’s not a great mom. I don’t think there is any helping her but I’ll take suggestions. She gets high and drives and wrecks brand new cars that my dad enables her by buying them. Most days I can’t stand her and wish she would just leave or OD. I can’t take her lies and excuses. She tells me how anxious and depressed she is. I’m depressed and I have anxiety too but I don’t turn to drugs. I hate most of my family because it’s like they all do drugs. My mom, aunt, uncle, cousin... I have a pile of drug addicts in my family and I feel like I can’t get away from it. Sorry this is all over the place and really just a rant.

addiction,lostlover24,2019/03/22,"Have I lost him to cocaine forever? My boyfriend broke up with me a week ago. I don't know why yet tbh because he made no sense whatsoever when he did it. We were perfect together until he started using cocaine and it affected our relationship. He broke up with me and said he wanted to stay friends. 2 days ago he says he wants me gone out of the blue and we had a fight. He said he never loved me and it was always his ex girlfriend. I haven't texted him in 3 days now but last we spoke, he was acting bizarre. He has been for the past month or so. I am at a loss of what to do. It hurts bad.

addiction,Cantasion,2019/03/22,"My friend has a terrible cocaine addiction but is scared to seek help because it may affect his job. I don't know what to do anymore. I have a good friend whose been battling cocaine addiction for a few years now and even though he's receptive to taking steps to get through it's extremely difficult for him. Right now he's cold turkey-ing (well, drinking himself blackout so that he forgets the symptoms) and has made it about three week, but the withdrawal is getting worse and he's saying he might relapse tomorrow. I keep asking him to go see someone but he's resistant because he says rehab or even counseling will go on your record and affect his job. I think this might be true (and I think he might work in some legal field, I'm a little unclear on the details) but I feel like there must be some way to protect his job. What can I do? What can he do? I'm terrified he'll relapse and I really want to help him get through this.

addiction,heyreddits11,2019/03/22,"Sometimes I'm so proud to be sober, and other times I hate it. Tonight I'm sad I'm an addict. Sometimes I don't want to be an addict. I just want to turn my brain off and let loose like ""everyone"" else.  I'm sad. I know my brain is different, I know that no matter what substance it is I am never satisfied and want more.  I know that.  I've been in and out of AA/NA for 10 years and you know ""nobody gets into those rooms on accident"".   

The past few weeks have been hard, I have so much to be grateful for, but I'm really really feeling my feelings and I hate it.   I see my friends just relax after work and drink a little and they have fun, and usually I can be there and just embrace being sober and everything is great. Tonight was different. I knew going to my friends house that there would be ""G"" there and I even spoke about it with my therapist that it sounded nice. Ive been sober for 17 months, and I am sad I have these thoughts.  I stayed sober and went home early.  I'm just sad and it sucks to be sober sometimes.

addiction,AtSea62,2019/03/23,"Been on Oxycodone for 2 months, worried about the withdrawal So I broke my wrist/arm very badly like 2 months ago, and I need to take Oxy to deal with the pain. It broke in 3 places and dislocated, and required surgery to put a plate in. I was on it constantly, even woke up most every night to take another dosage so that the pain wouldn't come back, and a few times during the day. Near the end the pain wasn't so bad that I needed to be taking as much as I did, but I liked it so I took more than I needed. I don't know if 2 months of constant use is enough for a detox/withdrawal (sorry if those are actually different things, idrk), but I kept upping how much I took and I'm going to have to stop in a few days since my prescription will be up, and my doc says I shouldn't need it anymore. I'm worried about the withdrawal, is it likely to happen, if so what should I expect and how can I deal with it. I didn't ask my doctor because I went with my mom and I was embarrassed to ask, and a bit out of it. I've heard that depression can happen too, I suffer from that normally (perhaps that's why I took more than I needed, idk) and if so I'm concerned about going into a depressive episode after I stop taking it. Is 2 months long enough for that to happen, or am I okay? I'm a 20 yo male if that affects anything",3.0615339951301728,3.5418639715302547,4.4974676905787625,89.15962727102455,72.98576512455516,7.766323281513393,24.042142723356434,7.85451343220497,0.9467323843416366,1020,26,236,13,19,341,140,281,0.14800000000000002,0.8059999999999999,0.046,-0.9799,1,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,1,14,15,0,1,14,1,21,4,0,4,0,44,51,28,0,15,8,1,0,3,0,4,4,2,0,1,18,16,0,4,1,0,0,8,5,11,0,0,13,2,27,4,38,32,10,37,0,5,0,0,8,12,0,7,20,156,45,2,0.0,0.0,0.08825248149105445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08016604926579991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09483002163325938,0.0,0.0,0.08968820201702772,0.0,0.0,0.07442111479841745,0.0,0.16909088690918378,0.0,0.0,0.06953969465941956,0.15102054964038972,0.055128940606882004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09873267925832926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07790259834088198,0.0,0.1954583562024991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166474649910982,0.186471071007185,0.15578477275089034,0.0,0.0,0.0944863620866358,0.0,0.09256506870452708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009944504163735,0.186889107160873,0.0,0.05973211901395688,0.0,0.07619622273749999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279371536158656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23991674403599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049701255448764185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13254737104779254,0.0,0.0,0.08003300602035009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591753943448026,0.2887405802489089,0.0,0.13296171790120426,0.33528570641089195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486805108181482,0.08860806962388512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886908113293118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944863620866358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909131493615955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719183297343334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748095861454078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10123568761850436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512170755609654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719864407925357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06008165382014467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05273395351366469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3014331401154175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810765951475589,0.0,0.0746191636490133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08383506952884498,0.08160441529581118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1836842770887722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,PermanentlyTuesdae,2019/03/23,"Maybe I Want To, Maybe I Don't. Hey guys,

So I started to realize something really crazy after being misdiagnosed by a psychiatrist and amped with tons of heavy meds when I was 17 (and back then I was anti-weed, alcohol, everything.) This changed my perspective on everything .I started believe everyone was doing some form of ""drugs"" to escape reality or to cope, and that was just the way it is. So it was right.

&amp;#x200B;

After realizing how f\*\*\*ed some (not all) psychiatrists are and how much they get paid to partner with big pharma companies, I wanted nothing to do with them. But I was stuck; these drugs were not things you could get off with in a day or so. I was angry, betrayed, ashamed (maybe for not catching the mistakes or standing up for myself) and disgusted. Then I met my best friend, HERB, mary Jane, weeeeeeed. So I kept taking as minimal pills as I could and used weed instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

Herb, or weed, was so awesome because I could be socially accepted by cool people and not feel like shit all the time because of depression and guilt feelings. I later realized that this was a temp fix (9 years later) and it doesn't do anything except isolate and make me anxious anymore. But pairing it with other things, it seemed, still covered up those feelings and was fun AF. So I started drinking and smoking weed, then discovered cocaine, then started a crazy love affair with all of them at different times and, when feeling risky, the same time too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never realized the meaning of ***ambivalence*** until now, the point in my life where I am losing things that I need (a job, human connection, etc.) I don't like doing drugs socially anymore unless a few others are on board (eases the guilt).I don't pressure- I would rather not share anything. I am not sure whether life is going to be worth it without something to cover up these painful emotions and feelings because I sure AF don't want to feel that. But the deep depression I feel from the crazy brain chemical rollercoaster has got me questioning everything, and I think I hate that feeling most of all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am at the point of seeking help for what would be labeled as 'addiction'. It doesn't feel that way; it feels like I want to do what I want when I want but I hate feeling bad...and because I can't stop when I feel bad---this is a sign. I know almost all the ""good"" ways to cope but they are hard and take a lot more effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is relatable to others. It is refreshing to realize that cycles and habits like these have an affect in the long run and its not too early to just explore other ways of living. If I had known that back then, that there are multiple ways of better coping, I would have probably went in that direction.

addiction,247thoughts,2019/03/23,"I can't go several days without relapsing and because of the guilt I end up spending days in addictive behavior. I am losing confidence in my ability to recover and fully heal. Hi there,

I went clean a few weeks ago and felt so good about the changes I was making in my life. I do not have a substance abuse problem, I have a food addiction problem that started a year ago due to anxiety issues that I have since worked through. I thought once I got through the root problem-anxiety-that the addiction would go. Instead I can't go a few days without relapsing, which caused a lot of guilt and then I just wallow in that space of going back to addictive behavior. I know **the triggers:**

\-When I haven't got enough sleep

\-When I work overtime and don't have time to unwind

\-When I relapse and feel guilty and decide to just forget about changing because clearly I can't even go a few days without staying clean.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:**

Thing is I am struggling with the last bit. I don't know if my brain will be able to rewire if I keep relapsing. If I get back up and continue the course each time one relapse happens and I keep doing this every time I have a relapse despite how frequent it is, does anyone know if eventually my brain can rewire and the desires associated with the addiction lessen?

I fear if it haunts me as an addiction and im still a teen. Will this grow into addiction it was only like 5 hits and then my mood went bad. I couldn't sleep I was weak and tired but had lots of energy inside but I still couldn't sleep or smile. I searched that a small amount of nicotine can increase heart rate and such, what will happen, i dont have any cravings or wants for it I hate it. But i still don't feel so well. I hope this does not grow to an addiction it was only 5 hits and not much I promised i wont do it again, I dont want to be addiccted.

Which is of course better than being dead. Known this kid before we even started dating for 13 years. Idk what i would do if i ever lost him. I love him with everything i have. I can't go through this anymore. I don't wanna take this risk anymore. I want the strength for him and myself to stop this shit man. It's just not worth it.

addiction,allshallbefree,2019/03/24,"My husband has been enabling me I used to be addicted to narcotic pain pills about 4-5 years ago. I ended up quitting only because my dealer went to prison and I had no other way of getting them. I was very sick physically and emotionally but I made it through and got better. Several years have gone by and now I am married with a kid. I’ve struggled with postpartum depression for almost 2 years now. I also have bad anxiety. I think my husband is just sick of seeing me depressed and sick of dealing with it because I honestly haven’t been helping clean the house much or anything like that. Just have no energy or motivation. So, he got me some pain pills. He said he would rather see me doing them and be functional than be the way I am now. So... I did it. I have been doing them for a couple of weeks and trying to justify my actions. I realized tonight I am really fucking up. Who am I kidding I cannot do them in moderation. I’m already wanting more and more. I gave him back the ones I had hidden and told him I want nothing to do with them anymore and to stop making them available to me in any way. I know I may change my mind and try justifying it again and try to get them from him again later. But I hope he says no and I am really proud of myself for giving them up tonight and saying no more. I don’t say this often but... please pray for me or send me positive thoughts of strength that I will be able to stay away from them.

Spending $1000 a month on food and shopping. Binging and purging every damn day. Online shopping for a fantasy life I don’t have. Depressed, exhausted, spiraling downward I go nothingness.

Restricting my calories, fasting for 16+ hours, avoiding sugar, working 55 hours a week, exercising frantically, trying to pay off all my debt, and attempting to perfectly address every problem.

There has to be a me, maybe in another dimension, who tries her best, takes care of herself, and doesn’t worry so much. A less extreme, softer version. I’d like to be her.

I'm thankful to myself for no longer being a prisoner to addiction, toxic thinking, behavior, and relationships. 

Before I got sober, my demons were out of control and calling the shots. They were unfed, unloved, and screaming for attention. Today, they still call the shots, but in a vastly different, graceful, protective way. My demons saved me.

addiction,Tossaway31141,2019/03/24,"My wife is drinking, hiding it and lying about it. Will keep the details at an obscure minimum but looking for thoughts from people with experience. 

She had an abusive upbringing and alcoholism runs in her family. She’s struggled in the past but appeared to have gained control for the past 5 years. 

MIL caught her with booze and lying about why she had it (wife doesn’t know I’m aware of this). I’ve smelled it on her and “know” when she’s been drinking due to telltale mannerisms. Ruled out medical causes (IE. diabetes) as best we can and she refuses to see a doctor. 

I see this as a symptom of mental illness and a failure on my part to keep open communication. I am not an angry or violent person at all but I am quite critical and assertive. 

What can I do?
What should I NOT do?",2.253084415584418,4.682777733766238,3.794918831168832,84.99809253246755,80.10389610389609,6.966883116883117,27.157467532467532,8.07648339933343,1.9892350649350647,617,27,119,12,16,204,98,154,0.196,0.731,0.073,-0.9707,0,0,3,0,0,0,17.0,1,0,0,4,3,3,1,1,9,0,14,9,0,2,1,30,25,14,0,1,6,2,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,1,8,12,4,4,3,2,0,3,3,2,0,0,5,4,16,1,22,18,3,16,0,0,3,0,13,8,0,3,5,86,24,1,0.0,0.20452299190634052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18447514306573512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811509569312472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773252722210109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1936047129475908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17668087735714522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33819800949514683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16885260924272358,0.16272800351831535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30685995194182125,0.0,0.0,0.18973164588619348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14495485735295424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17389352971815197,0.17395739851884034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18692745672441025,0.3295650353927617,0.11967093626826435,0.15072256037850498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18359949327966116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2751068991980735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18045683237342786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17941522129936002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13703866570649373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557600495787848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11115972844835896

addiction,Lil_KSA,2019/03/24,"Gamers For Recovery So awhile ago I had a idea while playing VR Chat. What if I held meetings for people that have social anxiety or are unable to get to a meeting on here.

&amp;#x200B;

This idea sprouted into me thinking I should start a discord server where people with all issues can come and get help in their recovery from addiction, mental health issues, abuse. 

Problem is 1. I need mod help, 2. I want to now how to help people with it without advertising it in subreddits and sounding like I'm advertising a clan and not just a helpful group.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly just want to do this for my step work (I'm a sex addict) and feel it would be helpful to my recovery. Plus I really feel like it could help people find a place to get better.

this is the discord: [https://discord.gg/JD33nY](https://discord.gg/JD33nY)

I have an online project which hopes to change the stigma surrounding addiction and homelessness.  I want to change societies perception of addicts or people affected by homelessness. I think hearing real stories of incredible and inspiring people can change this! 

You can inbox me and we can discuss the details of the project or write your story below and we can all have a chat and hopefully inspire one another.

addiction,Necrid41,2019/03/24,"Stupidity and death. I am an idiot and an addict. I’ve done every drug under the book and it all caught up with me with heroin which I’ve been clean from for 8 years this month. 

However about a year ago I started to drink, which led to a daily cocaine habit

Ive been using about 6-8g a week and taking a day off each week to recover 

I’ve succeeded and excelled at my job. My family doesn’t know present issue ( they are aware of the past) 

I realized tonight as I sat feeling like this was it, my pulse weak and not racing as it normally does so I started writing a letter to my parents and family explaining it’s not their and how sorry I am.

How powerful and sick can a disease be that even knowing I may die, even after surviving the heroin wave where I lost countless friends

I still continue on? I don’t have the problems I had a decade ago when I had an excuse to use (family issues, multiple surgeries, my love of working out and jiu jitsu taken from me)
Everything’s great family wise, I don’t work out so I’m not in pain. Life’s too busy. I haven’t dated since getting clean from dope for one reason or another.

Just needed to vent how freaking stupid I am.

addiction,min2themax,2019/03/25,"Resources to support my wife after her best friend overdosed. My wife’s best friend overdosed last night. She’s in a hospital right now with severe brain damage and it looks like she’s unlikely to pull through. 

This friend had been using heroin - and from what we’ve gathered she had only used a handful of times. 

My wife is beside herself. We live in another state and they had distanced from each other somewhat. Partly because of this friends’ alcohol abuse, and how it made her behave. 

I don’t know how to support her right now besides making tea, talking when she wants to talk and distracting her when she wants a distraction. I’m worried she’ll blame herself or feel guilt for not being there. 

Are there resources available that anyone would recommend either for me or my wife? I don’t know what to do.

addiction,ThrownAway2027,2019/03/25,"How can I tell if someone in my family is abusing adderall? Someone in my family has been very, very clean for the past few months. Competent, understanding and quite calm. Actually - if we were to argue, they'd be the one to back down.  


I remember them saying ""I found old adderall in my room, I may use it to clean before we move"".  


Ever since then - BOOM. Freaked the fuck out. Any conversation now consists of them rambling and then me sort of responding in a controlled manner... which is then met by more rambling.  


I've never seen anything like this. The absolute RAGE, the anger. The personal attacks. I really mean it. FREAKING OUT. ""You're no better than me! Who do you think you are? PUSSY! You're a pussy. Why do you think that I am on something, tell me! Why? I'm not on anything \*Maniacal laughing\*, what could I even get high on? If anything you're high! Karma is going to come and get you! \*Storms out the door....1 minute of silence and storms back in\* - KARMA IS GOING TO FUCK YOU UP! Telling me I'm high!"".  


Literally word for word. It is so unfair for me to be living with someone that does this. Holy shit, sometimes I abuse sleeping pills (OTC) and I get too drowsy, but damn. This is on another level.   


Trust me, I know this could very easily point to ""Of course they're high!"" but I know nothing, and I mean NOTHING about drugs. I really don't know if this is a bad personality, a high, or a comedown.

addiction,throwawayaezgsdxf,2019/03/25,"I think I might have an alcohol problem When I was younger I never used to drink much, I'm 24 years old now so I'm by no means old, but when I was a teenager I would occasionally drink one drink while at home with my parents, but I never went out and got hammered in high school, first time I got drunk was when I was probably 19 or 20, so I think when I was younger I had a pretty healthy relationship with alcohol.

Then I started university, I went out drinking and got drunk a few times but for the first couple of years it was all just good fun, never getting blackout drunk or anything. Then for a little while I was struggling with some stuff while at university, I was very minorly sexually assaulted by a friend, it wasn't a big deal but it did fuck with my head a bit and I was stressed about what I was going to do with my life and I would drink alone in my room sometimes, but my friends very quickly told me that needed to stop, and it did. Then for a while I was on a real health kick so I didn't drink at all, no alcohol, completely sober for about a year.

After university I started a college program and I would go out with my friends, who were all male so could drink quite a bit more than me, and I got drunk a little more often than I had at university but never anything bad.

Last summer I graduated and got a really good job in a new town so life is good now, things are good, but since moving away and not having friends to hold me accountable I've started drinking quite a bit more. For a while I was drinking at home alone when my roommate was out of town then one time I passed out on the kitchen floor next to a puddle of my own vomit and had to wake up and deal with that, which was not particularly nice, so I've stopped drinking alone. Also with my job I'm not allowed to drink on work nights, so 5 nights of the week I don't drink at all, and I'm not tempted to drink on those nights, it's easy to not even think about it. But these days I've been getting drunk a lot more often on weekends. 

A couple of weeks ago I went out with some coworkers, we went to a friends house first and I went through the beers I brought very quickly, then a guy I really like at work started offering me his beers, and then we went to the club and I don't remember much of that but I know I passed out on a table, was asked to leave, vomited in the uber on the way home, then had to be carried into the house to my bed by my roommate. So not a proud night for me. I said after that that I was going to give myself a two drink limit in a night, and the weekend before last that worked fine, I had two beers, but that's probably because that's all I had left in the fridge anyway. Then last friday I planned to just have two beers again, and after 2 beers I decided to have four more and I ended up getting very drunk again. 

I think part of my problem is that I'm very much a lightweight and I don't eat a lot, so I have one beer and that's enough to get me drunk enough to want to keep drinking more. 

I enjoy drinking when I don't get too drunk, I like those nights when I go out with friends and only have a couple of beers and I have fun, I've been told I'm a really fun person to drink with when I don't take it too far. I don't want to quit drinking, and I don't think I'm an alcoholic, I don't think it's that much of a problem. It's not like I crave alcohol every night or feel the need to drink most nights. It's just once I start I don't stop.

I don't want to be 24 years old and already an alcoholic who has decided to quit drinking. I want to be able to have fun with friends in moderation. But I don't know how to stop myself once I start drinking.

Any insight on how I should deal with this or if I even really have a problem or not would be really appreciated.

addiction,rabbi317,2019/03/25,"Is lying addiction a thing? Hi all, I just wanted to post this and see if I can get some help. I have a lying problem. Most of the time it’s little white lies to either comfort (ie I just lied to my GF about making an important phone call that I have been thinking about all morning, just haven’t done yet and said I did to give her hope) or as a way to get out of trouble/conflict. I used to be really bad about making things up about myself to impress others but I made a resolution a couple years ago to stop the stories and have for the most part. However the little ones keep slipping out and I don’t know how to stop it. I try to catch myself but sometimes I don’t and feel very ashamed of myself. Are there any resources for someone like me?",2.2324999999999977,3.783030583333337,3.6130769230769246,90.53192307692308,76.5,6.082051282051282,22.89743589743589,6.67199483983844,0.5238358974358976,585,17,126,5,13,192,100,156,0.14800000000000002,0.7859999999999999,0.066,-0.911,1,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,10,7,0,1,10,0,13,1,0,5,2,34,28,11,0,4,8,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,7,7,0,3,3,0,0,1,3,3,0,1,5,4,17,4,23,22,7,14,0,0,2,0,8,5,0,6,7,93,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18728600248012964,0.0,0.0,0.15228923144316026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11682904530495415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14344478521451992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17542573812030382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19009205584062705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17580977463392114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.086866613004619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17951551854735462,0.16480502121982996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11515308477910967,0.0,0.0,0.170634928751375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15270262800174422,0.0,0.0,0.0944161033676075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0839321942873523,0.34437497331325845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1625601368398058,0.2293540073277773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11641528324695655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860413110728218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16453571867792616,0.0,0.0,0.16438820755558578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100586822470642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634199584676922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13690136566573374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14556452844401846,0.0,0.16991336255894154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2872629052968203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2282709193705343,0.11008170590997043,0.0,0.0,0.10017723618795576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11664007815207365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14837896523860244,0.0,0.14175196591467265,0.10133135743638752,0.1363658559326135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063276621540304

addiction,HalpMe911,2019/03/25,"Helping Partner with Religious Addiction Hi Reddit,

I hope this is the right spot to post. My partner has become obsessed with religion. I am fine with religion, but he has taken it to an extreme. Addiction does run in his family and the religion trend started after a traumatic incident in his family.

**Here are some examples:**
&gt; 1.  Obsessing about religious conversation and reading the Bible. He's making all kinds of posts about it on Facebook when a few months ago he couldn't have cared less. He is very happy when he's talking about religion. He even has a app that tells him how many days in a row he's been reading the Bible.
&gt; 1. He's given up on actives he once enjoyed like video games. He now goes to the gym significantly less. Spends most of his time reading the Bible and will trade in sleeping or eating to spend time reading the Bible.
&gt; 1. My partner feels angry or upset when we are not talking about religion or when I ask to talk about something else. Almost to the point of being nasty.
&gt; 1. Very black and white thinking. There is no gray area. I broke down because he kept violating boundaries when it came to talking about religion.
&gt; 1. Jeopardizing our relationship. We are on the verge of a breakup. I feel like this is the start to more relationships. I know some of his friendships will be headed on the same path.* 
&gt; 1. After three years of being together, he is now retracting from sex and believes it is ""sinful"". I let him know it is not dirty, we are committed to each other, and a deal breaker to stop. 
&gt; 1. Constantly talking about accepting God, repenting, and making it into heaven. There is little focus on what's happening in the present.
&gt; 1. His views became uncompromising and I felt like he views his own as better than mine.

I know this isn't considered a typical addiction in this subreddit, but it's becoming a big problem. I am close to walking away because of it's effects. His views change so dramatically within a few months, I feel like I don't even know who he is anymore. Drugs are easy to acknowledge something is wrong, but religion is so much harder.

Any advice on how to approach before I end the relationship? I don't want to throw away a great relationship due to a recent, extreme change, but it's getting to that point. Thank you.

addiction,EthanIsAsleep,2019/03/25,"I've decided to join this subreddit today. So a couple of days ago I came to terms that I am addicted to Painkillers. So I came to this subreddit, I don't know what for. I'm only 17 and I know I shouldn't be addicted to painkillers but they just help so much with going through school and such. I started using them after I heard that they could make you feel better and they did. I can't tell my father about them because he would disown me and my mother is out of the picture. Most people on here just tell me to go to rehab but I can't because I'm ashamed with myself.

addiction,sierrascutz,2019/03/25,"my own thoughts, my own story. I never thought I’d be the girl to get so easily trapped in a world that I wasn’t in control of. I never thought I’d become an addict. I dropped out of school around January of 2017 and it’s probably my biggest regret. I spent the next couple months trying to rebuild my self esteem and get my head on straight. Sadly, that only made it worse. I had best friends but I met some people that changed my life in the worst way possible. I started using the beginning of summer 2017, after I got a dui for marijuana. At that point, I said fuck it. The weed wasn’t enough anymore. So I turned to coke. It made me feel like I could be anyone and do anything I wanted. I manipulated people, I was motivated to do ANYTHING to get my next high. I couldn’t tell you how much money I wasted to do this drug with people that never gave a fuck about me. Where are those people now? Gone. I let them use me. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and always try to see the good in the wrong people. Typically, I would do it 3-5 days a week but there were definitely times I went on binges. Summer 2017 was a blur. I couldn’t tell you how many times I came home off different drugs and I couldn’t really tell you what happened those days. I was doing anything to just escape reality. My reality turned into shit. I lost my closest friends. I lost my job. I lost myself. But I kept doing it because it was all I felt I had. It was the only thing that make life okay to live. During months of being constantly surrounded by these people that only wanted me around to help them get more, I was hurting people I loved the most. I made countless of mistakes and bad decisions that I will never be able to undo. To this day, it haunts me. I let that drug turn me into a monster. I was different. I acted like I didn’t give a fuck, but at the end of the day I just needed help. People consistently tried to be there for me, but I never listened. I was eventually given up on. Those best friends I had, hated who I was. I hated who I was. Fall of 2018 didn’t change anything. I was still running the streets, still broke from always having to have my fix, and still the same flawed girl who couldn’t stop fucking up. I eventually quit for a few weeks after I started probation. When my best friend at the time came home, we made a vow to never do it again. That didn’t last long. We had a group of us that would just go out and get some more, talk for hours, and tried to live our best lives. I don’t know if we were all in denial or if I’m the only one who felt like I was an addict, but I never admitted it to anyone. I could never talk to them about it, because I didn’t wanna stop. We had laughs, shared memories, and eventually I ended up falling in love. During the time, we were binging less. It went down to 2 times a week, but I was still up at night regretting everything. Hating myself for what I did to myself and others. Trying to change myself but I couldn’t because coke was STILL involved in my life. I ended up losing the only two girl friends I had because I chose this boy and this drug over them. I’ll never really know for sure if anyone those last couple years were real or not. I know I’m not perfect and I know I’ve changed but no one truly knows what I’ve been through. From a young girl to now. No one knows exactly how many nights I stayed up crying and hoping to god that i would overdose on accident just so I couldn’t go through this anymore. I genuinely hated myself and it’s no ones fault but my own. 2018, while I fell in love, it was perfect at first, but then we all got caught up in this lifestyle and it fucked us all over. I kept grinding. Kept trying to change myself, but it was never good enough. I was constantly tore down. I kept it pushing though because now that’s all I know. I don’t want to ramble but at the end of 2018. I became clean. I finally after almost 2 years of the constant battle, I stopped. But my perspective on everything has changed. I couldn’t and probably will never trust anyone fully. I’m constantly paranoid. I can’t talk to anyone about how I feel about myself because my reputation says I deserve it. All the emotional abuse I put myself through and I let others put me through. The disrespect I’ve gotten. The negativity. All of it is too much for me. I’m thankful for the people who stuck by my toxic self and who have been inspiring me to be a better me each day. It’s tough, believe me and posting this is one of the hardest things ever. I’m trying to love myself more and more each day. I’m trying to remember I’m not the same person I was then, but I still feel like it’s not good enough. All I genuinely want out of life is happiness and it took me a long time to realize I need to be alone to find myself again. Block out all the bad thoughts, all the self harming tactics I had, and everyone who tries to make me feel lesser than I am. We all make mistakes. No one is perfect. But I made a promise to myself that I would never go back to who I was back then. I apologize for everyone I damaged and pushed away. I never thought my life would end up like this. But I’m praying everyday for better days. No matter what you’re going through I promise you can do it with or without anyone. You may never know who truly supports you but you always have yourself. Someday, it’ll all work out and no matter how bad your past is, you can overcome anything and keep fighting. Life isn’t supposed to be easy, but it’s worth it. I may not be 100% better or 100% happy with everything right now, but I’m on my way. And if anyone is struggling with addiction, abuse, anything. PLEASE. Do not hesitate to talk to me or reach out to someone you love.

addiction,OMFGamy,2019/03/25,"My best friend needs to go to rehab Title says it all
She doesn't want to go. She knows she has a problem with prescription meds, but it's not just that. She dabbles in KAT and mushrooms as well.
Her family is begging her to go but shes playing it off as them manipulating her. I'm trying to be supportive but she has to go. I'm worried me being too harsh on her, and pushing her to get some help is going to destroy our friendship.

I'd really appreciate any advice on how I can help her without losing her as a friend.

addiction,Left_Mushroom,2019/03/25,"Dealing with multiple behavioral addictions &amp; weed addiction Hello there,

&amp;#x200B;

I have established a pattern of behavioral addiction, which includes masturbating to porn (1-2x / day), gaming (2-3 hours a day) and internet browsing (3-4 hours per day), combined with a daily weed usage (up to 1 gram per day). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where exactly these behaviors fall on the spectrum of addiction, but I know that I'm addicted to them because I have been trying to quit/moderate and have been unable to accomplish much of anything. These behaviors definitely have a negative effect on my daily functioning, my work/career, relationships etc. I'm still a functioning adult in the broad sense of the word, but I don't want to slip any further. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to quit the porn and weed use completely (have tried moderation, didn't work), and moderate my time online (either gaming or browsing) to a healthy amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for advice on how to best accomplish this. Some questions I have are:

\- Should I tackle one behavior/addiction at a time, or tackle them all at once?

\- Should I look for counseling or try to manage it myself first?

\- Are there any self-help instruments that I can apply? 

\- What kind of goals should I set for myself?

\- How do I best keep myself from relapsing?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",5.772160493827157,8.138669209876548,6.144384773662555,72.65089814814819,68.83539094650206,9.962880658436212,32.7261316872428,10.241411754978122,3.9656981069958857,1090,50,173,31,20,350,136,243,0.026,0.818,0.156,0.9887,0,0,0,0,0,0,77.0,0,0,2,10,6,5,0,0,11,0,22,7,0,4,2,30,32,11,0,6,6,0,0,1,0,5,5,0,0,1,8,6,0,1,4,2,0,2,4,0,0,2,3,2,21,5,29,23,8,24,0,0,2,2,9,11,0,5,11,116,29,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4451103497541086,0.0,0.13299626584332566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.442395943027226,0.41344385533693545,0.13882996200595382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05599973956511428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0414829356540584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14282954239871584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07134962439414767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17554769713208304,0.07015704777545434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589426377654175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05788369608401829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04561279643837067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13403201292085984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060486385579758085,0.0,0.07086409392112146,0.07479751865391829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03324602289203544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11429051380640172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05002492635837245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07247153095709162,0.046112760480924636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07623210188509179,0.14476010535082506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07306073894756235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099148277296803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05434519424685017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06265173106040962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07936155406978296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13860540909116886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05877375799482061,0.0,0.0,0.04013793107180588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09908310709845468,0.0,0.0,0.09668220462914763,0.0,0.41344385533693545,0.0
addiction,warnerbrotha123,2019/03/25,"Isolation I find it unfortunate that for most people cleaning up their act and trying to live a more positive, healthy lifestyle almost always requires you to isolate yourself from people that you love and care about. A lot of things haven’t been going my way lately and I feel I need to make some serious changes with my activities that are rapidly becoming habits/coping mechanisms. Of course making these changes will be very difficult if I’m not careful about who I surround myself with at first.  For the most part I do have a very solid friend circle and I know most would support my decision to abstain from smoking, drinking etc, etc. But I know I cant keep surrounding myself with substance for my own physical and mental health. I need to focus on myself for a while and take some time to get back to business, especially with the nice weather on the way (getting sick of sleeping my days away).

Someone suggested to me to find new friends, which I suppose is an option but it seems excessive given how fond I am of the friends I have now.  In particular I know there is 1 friend of mine for sure, who will always try to pressure me to get on the train he’s riding, I’m hoping if I assert myself and let them know I’m serious about this that they will respect that. But then again there will always be that temptation. Ideally I would get 1 or 2 of my friends to join me in making healthier choices, but I can’t change the world. 

This is my first post and I’m interested to hear if someone has an opinion or personal experience they could share with me. 

-Thanks.

addiction,ksalvino88,2019/03/25,"Tomorrow is the day! I REALLY need to quit. Everything. Smoking drinking and all other negative vices I have seem to fallen back in to. I have a loving husband and wonderful 3 year old son. My husband and I decided to go off birth control about 4 months ago to try for a second baby. Even before then I wanted to at least cut down and be healthy and physically and mentally ready for the new addition... But I realize now I'm in a lot deeper than I thought. It was so hard cutting it all vold turkey when I found out I was pregnant last time... Even tho I stopped everything as soon as I got the positive pregnancy test, my marriage took a hit as I struggled with withdrawals. Its not all something I want to share on a post, don't know if I want to go into more intamite details for all to see, but I am hoping putting this out there will somehow hold me to more responsible and I can over come this struggle. I want so bad to be clean and sober even if I wasn't trying for a baby..  I am hoping maybe someone might reach out to me too so I can really just come clean with it all.

Hey Guys,

Thanks for reading i have a few questions about some supplements I am thinking of buying for my dopamine and serotonin levels come back to normal from long term abuse of addiction. I am starting to run and exercise feel much better I still get cravings thru the day I've made progress and believe i need a bit of help my reason to go down this road.

I would like to know if any of these shouldn't be mixed or just straight waste of money and no effects are given from supplement. Could I drink all of these daily on top of my vitamins ? seems like a top if so please just point out the top 5 most beneficial ones.

So anyways here are the supplements i am thinking of buying and the links.

Would I get really bad and long withdrawals as I did for the first time (up to a 3-4 weeks longlasting), if I smoked 1 cigarette after a year or so, of not smoking nicotine at all? Or should I be fine If I kept it at 1 cigarette?

addiction,a_k_a_non,2019/03/26,"My drug use Just want to share my story

So my substance usage started soon after I lost the most prominent father figure in my life, my grandfather, when I was 15 years old. Out of boredom and curiousity, I started drinking. Two months later, in hospital for alcohol poisoning. Moved on to weed a few months after that, eventually increasing my frequency of use through highschool years. Around the same time, I tried Percocet recreationally, told myself that this was the best feeling ever, until my opiate naive body sent me into a nauseous spell, ending in vomit.  I never forgot that awesome feeling. Throughout highschool, I continued and accelerated my weed use. Eventually found myself wanting to experiment with opiates again. I occasionally used opiates in binges. For example, took about 40 Percocets and 20 hydros within about 2 weeks. Dxm, Ritalin, Adderall, Xanax, all found their way into my system. I sold weed and stole most of the meds from family members, so money was never an issue. Moved to oxy 30s, and continued to use somewhat sparingly while I was 17-19.  I'm 20 now, junior in college. Don't like my classes much, not many friends. I do have a wonderful girlfriend, who has put up with a lot of my drug related bullshit. Stopped dealing awhile ago. Switched weed for dabs. The big thing however, is I recently decided to start myself on heroin. Great idea, I know. Well anyway, been snorting H for about 5 months, almost daily at night, never shot it. Also decided to cop a 1g bag of meth recently to give me a boost. Another brilliant idea.

The thing with me is that I don't consider myself a ""heavy user"". When I dab, I find myself using small amounts, not even .1g daily. My heroin dosage has increased slightly over time with tolerance. I've done about 2g of pure H over the past 5 months, to give you an idea. Just ran out, was looking with a flashlight along the floor last night and my eyes lit up when I found a lil chunk of heroin on the floor. Enough for a night or two. A huge sense of relief. 

While writing all this I realize I am an addict, although I am not a ""heavy user"". Feeling depressed as of lately. I'm moving into the adult stage of life, having to get a ""real"" job despite a shitty gpa (2.8) has weighed on me. In general feels like I am not good enough.

I plan on snorting the last chunk of heroin tonight and trashing the meth. I'll use the last of my dabs
(.25g) and not planning to buy any more. I want to lead a normal life, without drugs, and if I continue this path I know it will only get worse. Hopefully this is the last time I say this to myself.

Thanks for reading, any tips or comments are appreciated

addiction,Dyanuh143,2019/03/26,"My past keeps haunting me Tomorrow (fingers crossed) I finish up the custody battle with my ex husband. He tried making my addiction disorder the most important aspect of his case. In May I will be 3 years sober and before I relapsed I was nearly 6 years in recovery. Last week I had to bring my son who had a very high fever to the emergency room, the Dr. on call saw MY flagged med history and called DCF (CPS in other states) for no other reason then because I am an addict. 
I know my mistakes are my own and I don't blame anyone else. But, it doesn't make it hurt any less that I'm seen as someone incompetent and unworthy of trust with my own children. They are everything to me and the reason I've fought tooth and nail to be sober more than not. It feels like it will never matter how well I do.

addiction,Knives4Bullets,2019/03/26,"I think I have a problem I’m 16. I have tons of hobbies outside school. Archery, karate, a few instruments, choir. And then there are computer games. Minecraft and Rocket League.

Minecraft is alright I guess - I sometimes play it on my laptop during classes, but in an odd way playing it while listening helps me memorize what has been told(And at least in psychology, I can write notes during playing). I don’t think I have a problem with Minecraft.

Rocket League, however... I’ve been playing since last October or so and I am not even good at it. I keep playing it for hours, when I come home, before bed, etc. Today I missed karate telling myself I’d study. I’ve been playing Rocket League the whole time and now I feel like shit for missing karate. I have bunch of overdue stuff for tomorrow, and a math exam on Thursday, that if I fail, will cause me to be expelled from school.

I keep playing it and every time I say “One last game” only to press “Find next match” button before even realizing. Right now I only managed to quit because I suddenly got FPS drop that made the game unplayable. I don’t believe in god, but I kind of think it was some kind of signal. 

The weather is beautiful. If my bicycle was safe to ride(Right now it is not safe at all. My dad will take it to repair sometime soon) I’d go and ride right now. I like skateboarding, but I’m bad at it and I’m afraid that someone will see me being a total clown on it - I don’t know any secluded spots where the asphalt is smooth enough for riding, save for local skatepark, but there are people there.

I don’t really have friends to hang out with. I don’t know why I keep playing - maybe it’s because I’m lonely, maybe because I feel I’m never good at everything and thus worthless, and try to achieve feel of superiority from something, even if it is an invisible opponent. I get so angry about this game, I have anger problems already and this isn’t helping. 

I don’t want to completely quit - I just want to make it so I don’t sink all my time into it anymore. I want to play less, a lot less. 

I’m uninstalling. Maybe I’ll install it again tomorrow, but for today I’m uninstalling, and maybe I’ll try and start with that history project. Perhaps at the evening there will be less people out so I can go skate.

addiction,love_more88,2019/03/26,"Been having a rough week or 2... Tapering kratom and phenibut since Jan 11. Have been doing really well with that actually, but the last week or 2 anxiety and depression (part of the reasons I started using) are creeping in. I've also been drinking every night to self medicate though, so maybe I'm not doing so well. And maybe that's contributing to the anxiety/depression. I just can't seem to stop... 

It's like I can't control my negative, scary thoughts and it makes me feel uncomfortable and scared and out of control all day long. I just want to forget. I just want to be happy. 

I took more of the kratom yesterday for one of the doses, and today I took an extra dose of phenibut. I don't necessarily feel like that's a huge deal, as that alone won't throw me off track, but I can't keep doing it either!

I feel like I need to order my supplements again, they should help... I just can't seem to manage to do the things I need to do, even just ordering that stuff. 

It'll get better. Everything is okay. I am safe. I just need to believe it. I just want to feel it. I won't drink today. I really don't want to. But I've been saying that. I need to just put my foot down and not drink!

addiction,themagicclap,2019/03/26,"Almost four years without meth and I'm laughing again It's something that's been pretty noticeable and really nice, but not exactly a motivating factor for someone just starting off. Four years of recovery, of trauma, anxiety, pain, panic attacks and deep depression, all of which I'm still dealing with. 

If you're years into recovery and things are looking bleak, know that the brain has the capacity to recover and I believe that I'll be seeing changes 10+ years in. Just be patient and hold tight.

addiction,ThrowiiingUpAway,2019/03/27,"I’m spiraling from drinking/coke to bulimia? I’m currently on day 55 and in AA. It was going reasonably well and I thought I was doing great lately. Been exercising and eating really well. Maybe too well now that I think about it. 

In the past, when I would be hungover from drinking, I would eat a ton of junk food and then throw it up to feel better.  Or, sometimes when I ate too much I would throw up.  Sometimes to lose weight id just throw up dinners. 

The last two days, all I want to do is eat.  I want junk food. I’m starving. Then I have an erg to throw up.  

It’s like my addictions are looking for somewhere to go. Anyone have any thoughts? Been through anything like this?

addiction,kreativesoul17,2019/03/27,"My bf(40M) is on all sorts of drugs but is functioning. Can he quit on his own? My bf of 2 years has been taking adderall, coke, oxy, weed and sometimes Xanax. He would start with addrall, then move on to oxy and occasionally coke. I would give him crap then he would stop for a month or so but give in eventually. It’s been this cycle for the past year. 

He is highly functioning and hasn’t done anything wrong or stupid on these things. 
He was clean for about 2 months (was just taking weed oil) then slipped and picked up adderall a couple days ago. I got fed up and broke up with him to show him I was serious. 

My question is is this something he can kick on his own without going to a rehab or support groups? How addictive are these things? Aren’t drugs usually for ppl in their 20-30s? I hadn’t seen anyone in their 40s use drugs like this.. but then maybe I’ve been living in a bubble. 
Should I be there for him instead of ending the relationship? Please help.

addiction,simple_beauty,2019/03/27,"I've identified that I am an addict, which began through childhood trauma and emotional neglect. My life consists of waking up and partaking in numerous goal-oriented tasks through which I reward myself with my addictions. Without addictions, I have fundamentally no idea what to do with my life. At 5 years old, I was hit in the upper lip by a large rock, which was traveling at 60 mph and was shot out of a lawnmower. The rock exploded my lip, and created a few years of a bizarre lifestyle for a 5 year old. This included going to court a few times, in order to sue a lawn mowing company, and being told to lie about how much my scars caused me to suffer. I also grew up with a narcissistic and terrifying father, who has so seemingly no relationship with unconditional love, which caused me to live with a father but to not really have a father. I have identified that these two 'happenings' in my childhood are what caused me to escape myself and my emotional pain. 

I have utilized the weightroom as one form of addiction. If you scan my reddit posts, you'll find a picture of my weight loss transformation (310lbs-205 lbs...fat kid to fitness model), which sort of acts as a symbol for how intense I can be with my addictions, or with chasing goals when I know I want them. WIth that same intensity in the gym, I began using adderall in college. This created a sort of lifestyle in my mind, where, every day, I woke up and needed to get high. Because I functioned so well in society and was attending one of the most prestigious colleges in the country, I never let myself think that I was an addict. ""Me? No way. Ha!"" Totally ignorant and arrogant and lost. 

Adderall f\*cked me up, man. I would take 60mg instant release and then spend 3 hours at the gym. My poor heart. I was moving at such a fast pace in my head, all the time, that my anxiety became profound. I would limit my anxiety by ridding all my energy on the treadmill (I would walk for 90 minutes on a full inclined treadmill, at 4 mph...burning about 1700 calories) so that I would be so exhausted that I couldn't think as much as I otherwise would (so this helped to avoid anxious thinking). Then, at midnight, my body would be so desperate for calories that I began eating insane amounts of sweets. I'm talking a full box of creamy cinnabons, with 5 candy bars, and two pb &amp; j's. Then, I'd wake up and torture myself on the treadmill again, only to eat like shit all over again.

My entire life has been this cycle of addictions, ranging from subtle to pretty intense addictions. But, I am at a time in my life when I want to get real about myself, and I want to let go of all of this insanity. I want stability and truth. I want to be there for other people. I want to be fully immersed in my life, in the present moment, and doing what I know I am here to do, for others. But, I cannot even begin to fathom what to do with my life when I let go of seeking the 'high'. I have no idea who I am when I stop chasing getting high, and that breaks my heart. It breaks my heart that I let this go on for this long. 

Has anyone else experienced the same kind of thinking? Were you able to let go of your addictions, and, if so, how did you restart your life? In other words, how did you step back into your life, starting totally fresh, after more than a decade of living the addictive-life, without any order or direction or sense of true self?",5.942723732407941,5.992248016541357,6.657293233082707,77.7032870638134,66.57894736842105,9.767881241565453,32.389627915943706,9.532500598960619,2.8734931559668397,2661,102,512,49,39,879,304,665,0.121,0.7959999999999999,0.083,-0.9875,1,1,0,0,0,0,99.0,0,8,1,5,28,20,2,1,34,1,48,34,10,8,9,96,84,50,0,16,11,3,1,1,0,7,19,1,1,3,33,31,4,5,10,6,2,12,10,11,1,4,16,5,79,9,105,48,18,93,0,4,1,1,22,41,1,9,35,380,112,3,0.056160392182398364,0.0,0.0,0.5510080535763979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044911445338073126,0.0,0.06084976146606461,0.0,0.0381909925059381,0.0,0.08592509260356322,0.0634452577460199,0.0,0.03926865200809142,0.057542958518967416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043183875014137806,0.0,0.0342348538124756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062381535260499776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17307657858999426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03621880692432168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11493220331974413,0.04691480132426749,0.1263457644461298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037093409375200864,0.0,0.04731755259152399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05132958102342281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08802446094178885,0.0,0.15958622547001353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049662449334351454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0576367646526776,0.0,0.0,0.19965100541366332,0.037643127069601615,0.17800961328058873,0.0,0.0,0.05530667365013936,0.0,0.0,0.12679649381499375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05848240626397879,0.06172856564461319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28713902994742874,0.3173419668683267,0.027437130849337552,0.0,0.09918131040627877,0.049700179816944065,0.0,0.0,0.0613057022098983,0.0,0.05068694659271794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056705986576029925,0.0,0.0,0.05968960909257485,0.0825687003032144,0.041642219197502925,0.04331435662942284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178617688012188,0.0,0.07611147037033343,0.04271250893890802,0.05975861688413065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038934544686440364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053786131544476055,0.05713530887493923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0639228213781283,0.035977785301073685,0.0,0.0,0.06029524376384236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05112631180603636,0.058587537172665564,0.0,0.05764783552871064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03975061464265378,0.0,0.0,0.046952602560382514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04222562567412017,0.045139595918365326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14394124661293578,0.0,0.0,0.09824272893440072,0.0,0.0,0.053663661431015634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097210854761096,0.0,0.0,0.048504547261125464,0.0,0.0,0.19874912624859936,0.04457750526330316,0.0,0.06838822798041881,0.05049493716393719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10827322795112693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393683877160393,0.0,0.0,0.10849635382403892
addiction,zombiemagikx,2019/03/27,"My mom made it 3 years and relapsed recently :( I'm just looking for some advice. My mom was an addict for 12 years and finally quit 3 years ago. She was successfully staying clean even though my dad has a prescription for one of her drugs of choice (she loves opioid pain killers). I found out the other day that she's started taking pain pills again and I need a little guidance on how to deal. This has been one of my biggest fears for the last 3 years, my heart is pretty broken but I still teeter between being really sad or really mad about the whole thing with very little control over my emotions because I'm taking this so hard. What have some of you learned to do in order to cope with the emotions?

I can't go one day without scavenging through my parents liquor cabinet and/or smoking weed. I have no intention of fucking my life up again but i'm not gonna lie to myself about the fact that as soon as i get that first paycheck I'm probably gonna blow it all in less than a week on half balls.

addiction,CoryBergRecordings,2019/03/27,"My best friend shared his experience with AA and how it DID NOT work for him My best friend Brian Stephenson is 6 years sober and he's given me a whole new perspective on the grips of addiction, the never ending battle with it, and how to better address it wither other addicts. This guy is an amazing inspiration and I strongly believe staying sober after such a long stint with alcohol/drugs is one of the most resilient things you can do as a human.

If you have a minute I'd urge you to share you experience and stories with him, as you never know who you may impact for the better.

addiction,NiaomiW,2019/03/27,"Any advice for the daughter of an addict? I've never met the person my Mum was before addiction. I think for me that has to be the worst bit. I lost my Dad when I was 9, also to addiction. I have the most painful, constant battle between my head and my heart over how to manage my relationship with my Mum and if to have one at all. My heart has been broken and my hopes have been crushed more times than I could count. I have horrific death related anxiety since losing my Dad the way I did, and my Mum is just a constant fucking trigger for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's heroin, mainly. Although I think she just depends on being smashed at all times. I'm obese by some form of addiction, a lot of her problems are akin to mine. One more burger, one more bag, etc... I know how incredibly difficult it is to **want** change, and want it enough to make it happen. I'm 24 and I desperately don't want to waste my youth completely miserable about how I look with zero self esteem or confidence. I cry, promise myself that I've finally had enough and I AM going to change, and yet I still find myself in Mcdonald's for breakfast or the takeaway for tea. It's a horrendous fight inside my mind, and so I really do understand my Mum's problem. I will for her to change with every fiber of my being, but until she wants it enough, nothing will change. That doesn't make it any easier for me to deal with though, and I'm completely lost on what to do.",3.720537156038887,4.85656655709343,4.9252397429560055,84.26251441753173,72.01038062283737,8.272927994727302,26.218652166749052,8.704169506293173,1.7783088152908233,1121,36,230,20,21,371,154,289,0.14400000000000002,0.809,0.047,-0.9685,0,0,0,0,1,0,41.0,0,0,0,3,12,14,3,1,10,0,26,12,3,7,3,47,47,23,1,9,6,7,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,2,11,14,3,0,5,0,0,1,3,12,0,4,9,1,40,2,38,32,16,19,0,4,1,1,17,6,1,8,11,171,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39946921548726594,0.0,0.0895192293470347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07325966357132661,0.0,0.0992582852732262,0.1113149307564164,0.12459448772485752,0.0,0.07008061451916524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07795248972549164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001327331146234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38764059115369387,0.0,0.19210053303267308,0.19799351285446412,0.0,0.07314231160962142,0.0,0.1006281565340378,0.0,0.09444482986492732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2839696769168561,0.10216822197309146,0.0,0.0,0.07718451182721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003531534261832,0.08372894278343973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846910204817091,0.0,0.0,0.0520634911682077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08100951334287955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09401723672017656,0.0,0.0,0.2171141510169831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09098838170016096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050345896439356635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692846601932743,0.10248700946310647,0.20000403394248792,0.07788267389798166,0.0,0.0,0.12229940326935056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924989491602576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07065448841812133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08790128145379378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862298353329564,0.0,0.09747840746305043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799894227496719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1753148324967715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05868705465516779,0.0,0.0,0.09835375459060512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09556813926679604,0.0,0.0,0.0757798901202903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07315904513325215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173986633198104,0.09000535202855826,0.0,0.10683585911320573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953681729074952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21613338596229645,0.07271493967418914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113149307564164,0.0

Is anybody experienced or have any insight here? My understanding is that it doesn’t get you high, but is derivative of marijuana.

addiction,FiendingFiend,2019/03/28,"Living With Parents The Only Thing Keeping Me Sober??? I've had a lot of issues with drugs, mainly booze, cocaine and speed, for years.

These problems accelerated when I moved to the big city, away from my parents' place.

Eventually I acquired a crippling meth addiction, and was forced to move back in with them.

Since then, I've moved away from my parents' place for short term time periods, and ever single time, I find myself quickly resuming a weekend coke habit and even more frequent drinking.

For most of the past year I've been sober, but it's only been while living with my parents. In every single one of my stints alone, the drugs have made a comeback.

It seems to me that the shame of being caught high in my parents' home is the only thing really strong enough to keep me sober. And I do want to stay sober--or at least the better part of me does. In this past year, I've saved money, made investments, watched my money grow, etc. I can't give that up for some temporary chemically induced feelings. But man, it just sucks that I can't do this on my own.",5.064375866851594,6.0788725388349505,5.099056865464632,84.7126213592233,68.75728155339806,7.633287101248268,27.335644937586693,7.7094869923839395,1.4643062413314831,837,26,164,9,14,261,123,206,0.066,0.8640000000000001,0.07,0.3978,5,1,5,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,1,3,6,6,1,1,11,0,11,6,0,3,1,27,21,10,0,2,3,5,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,11,9,3,2,4,2,3,5,2,3,0,1,7,2,19,3,29,13,13,38,0,0,1,0,8,14,1,4,18,109,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082740716042071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028661475383692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866298727242366,0.07637138060998659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08784096488204497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691609211916437,0.0,0.0,0.0972963379116369,0.23036063681590044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10262468942916364,0.11076867956491293,0.06560029373436416,0.08984113350845806,0.08368185618630236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05021945982041527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09077719328354804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952773321657177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10493762562713978,0.09962662064741684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10366486124736936,0.0,0.17656135599525782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17540374975509526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08443878910740232,0.0,0.18795903231529806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3166861139472501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730218247592927,0.22661328627267896,0.0,0.0,0.5514186452026719,0.10755448869477804,0.1896254273956326,0.0,0.0,0.2075376935925045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503636320952047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06362729453605379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041770838872948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821589942948163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10586250285701447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13196833474891256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158292355060232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05858184010298885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19187755452651534

addiction,freedom_oh,2019/03/28,"Have you regained a relationship (friendship) after that person went no contact during active addiction? I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but last night, I told my ex that I refuse to answer his calls anymore. 

We have had the same conversation for over 10 years now and I'm done... something needs to change and it has to be me. 

I feel bad but at the same time, I'm going through my own issues and this is affecting my mental health negatively. 

I would like to be his friend, I would like to support him but right now, I can't and tbh, nothing I've done in the past has really done anything. 

Do you think one day he'll realize why i had to step away or are my actions as unforgivable as I feel they are?




Side note: we so share a child together. He's 13 right now and has no interest in seeing or talking to his dad (but knows I'll take him to the jail to see him right now)... I told my ex he's still welcome to write our son but ex asked whether he'd write back, I answered truthfully with ""doubt it""... tbh, I doubt he'll even write our son, he never really does.

addiction,ButtonedGrub6,2019/03/28,"Does cold turkey leave health issues? Tips? Male. 24. Tall and slender. 
For the past few years Ive used alcohol and Marijuana nearly every day. Now the past six months have been that plus a couple cigarettes or a vape daily and a ton of black coffee in the morning to recover. I got extremely sick with the Flu on Saturday (5 days ago) and I haven’t used ANY of these substances during this period. 
The only withdrawal I’ve welt so far is the nicotine. Is there any issues quitting all these substances at once that I should be on the look out for that I may not notice right away?

addiction,Augustina2019,2019/03/28,"herbal addiction help I am not sure if this is the right place for this post. And I hope what I say isn't considered laughable!
I am kind of stuck in a cycle of addiction to herbal, legal products. I do not drink or do any drugs. 
I take Kratom and Kava at fairly high doses every day. I used to be more stuck on the Kratom, but I have been able to lower my dose over time, go to powder use only, and  a few times a day. The Kava is the more serious problem at this point. I am taking it in capsule form, and taking a lot of these a day. 
This combination helps me with fatigue, mood, appetite, depression, anxiety, and basically turns me into a person that - as someone heavily laden with mental illnesses- I don't feel I can be without them. 
I have been able to alter what I am doing  to make it more, and more, and more cost-effective, but it still does not feel good to spend money on these that I could/should use elsewhere. 
Some of my mantras are that they are safe (I know all the speculations, I've done months of research,) they are the only thing to ease my insomnia/depression/anxiety and they do so ever so well. I do not drink, not do any drugs, I eat healthily...it may be better in some ways or cheaper in some ways than getting prescriptions (I have no insurance).

addiction,ChiliJunkie,2019/03/28,"Small lock box to lock things away for some time? Hello everyone,  


I am new to this subreddit but I have a question about a small lock box to lock away things I have an unhealthy habit towards.  


I am looking to lock away something small, be it smartphone or similar size things in a box that I then can not access. In the best case, its smartphone connected and I give my friend the code or something like that (or they generate it?), so I can access the contents on specific occasions. A timelock of xxx hours also works...but would prevent me from using the contents should  I need them. My friend will decide if its okay for me to open it, I would not know the code.  


I do not mean a small safe or something similar (way too bug and too expensive)

addiction,Oh_my_Japanese_Boy,2019/03/28,"Phone, porn, cigarettes Addicted to my phone. I lose sleep because of it. I even carry my dishes to the kitchen with my phone in hand. I'm THAT addicted. It hardly charges.

Porn, that's a whole othet story. So bad that I can't face the world beyond my room. I feel so damn guilty. And I know that I can't stop. I should seek help but I can't afford it.

Cigarettes are a huge chunk of my student budget. I smoke two packs of Winston Blues in a day.

Let's not mention the fact that I hardly attend a lecture. I'm screwed but there's a way out I'm sure. But porn is killing me.",-1.049674796747965,1.0463744796747996,1.0815040650406509,99.47965447154472,96.88617886178862,4.034146341463415,17.402439024390244,5.82211442006289,-0.4972634146341459,443,13,104,4,18,146,73,123,0.171,0.733,0.095,-0.8762,1,0,3,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,1,5,6,3,0,8,0,7,11,3,0,2,13,12,6,1,1,4,0,4,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,8,3,2,1,2,0,1,1,4,5,0,1,0,5,16,1,10,10,1,11,0,1,1,4,5,7,2,0,2,60,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4895874397855249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18749069394871712,0.13688419696067058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448168094383003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483138085726972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135397256083875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4023071545945049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15051179269628345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.248432396197616,0.0,0.12340734948191533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22961859715081695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512151156034033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22471315420398605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187734679163414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2116366470108938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21935368495099605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17823812083151622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25070315687773875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Devin2019,2019/03/29,"I'm trying to quit my internet addiction and I keep relapsing! I spend countless hours on my laptop on Reddit, YouTube, and other miscellaneous content. My internet addiction is consuming my life. I'm wasting my life.

I'm only 21 years old. This should be a time in my life where I'm enjoying it to the fullest.

The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is go on my laptop and go on the internet. Before I go to bed, I'm on my laptop.

Since I've been home from school for 11 months, I've been on my laptop 24/7. It's my world.

I have no friends or a social life.

I've tried to quit or limit my time on my laptop countless times and I've failed every time.

I really want to quit, but it's so hard.

addiction,SalohcinTheBrave,2019/03/29,"Please. I been trying to quit smoking weed...to no luck. I been smoking everyday for about 6 years now. It’s got me in trouble, lost me my fiancé and Job and has overall been a hindrance to me. Despite all this, I can’t seem to quit. Not even for one day. I hate myself sober. Nothing is fun, nothing is funny. I’m miserable and worst of all, I get angry so easily. Usually taking it out on the people I love/closest to me. The days I try and quit, I’m just so miserable. I end up lying in bed doing nothing all day, because everything seems like it would suck without me being high. Things I love, such as American dad, playing red dead redemption, reading books and anime, movies...it seems like I can only enjoy these things while I’m high. If I’m not, I won’t even attempt to do it. I’m not sure if I’m depressed as well, or if that’s just how addiction is, but I hate it and it’s so hard. When I’m smoking and I’m high, I’ll literally tell myself that I need to quit, and I’ll agree and it’s all good. As soon as I come down, it’s like, “what the hell was I thinking”

How do you quit your addiction, if your addiction is what making life worth living? I’m so confused, hurt and desperate. I really don’t know what to do anymore.

addiction,sealteamrickxxx,2019/03/29,"Addiction I need advise. My boyfriend of five years who has always been a good man, friend, and provider (I only point out provider because he has his own money but is now stealing my prescription Xanax) has recently become extremely depressed. It has progressively gotten worse due to lack of work. It’s so bad he bought me a SAFE because he admitted he couldn’t help himself from stealing my medication. Last night I came home to him out of his mind and my safe wide open. He emptied what was left of my Rx (I’d say at least 5 bars). He’s ok and I’m letting him sleep it off before confronting him. I finally caved and told his sister-in-law and best friends. I am terrified he’s going to hate me now and feel attacked. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

addiction,CatYowl,2019/03/29,"Tips to help taper off Xanax? Hi,

I’ve been using Xanax pretty consistently for the past 5-6 yrs. Long story short it’s just ruining my life. The problem is I have extremely bad anxiety naturally which is why I began taking it.

Aside from the obvious (slowly reduce my dosing) is there anything else I can do to help.. I go to work every day and work 9-10 hours, my job is very stressful and anxiety-inducing. Without medication I’m a mess and I don’t have insurance, and it’s much cheaper to just buy Xanax on the street than it is to see a doctor.

addiction,cherrytree95,2019/03/29,"Weed Addiction I love weed. I smoke 3 times daily and have been doing so for about 5 years. I'm at a point in my life where I think it's time to quit but I dont want to. I live in Canada where it was finally legalized but now that I have kids it's a different story. My weed use never seemed to affect my parenting (expect in positive ways) or life until recently. I live with my dad as well as my husband and two kids. If I lived alone I know I could quickly sneak on to the deck for a few tokes and come back inside but in my current situation that is not an option. I could plan my day perfectly so that I could have a smoke break while my kid is sleeping, but with my dad around it suddenly changes my plans and then I experience this anger and rage because I didn't get my ""release"". It's dawned on me that this anger can affect my kids and that is why I think I need to quit because I can see now that it isn't just something I like to do, but an addiction because I cannot control my rage when I can't smoke. I wish I could make it work but I cannot handle this anger. I am usually a happy/positive person but when people change my plans I lose it. I operate on a schedule where I plan my days out, but if there is a change in plans and it affects my ""smoke break"" I get so mad. I think it's because of the withdrawal since this usually happens with the first joint of the day. It makes me realize how much control weed has over me and I wonder how free I will feel if I could quit. It's difficult though, because I love smoking, the smell, the feeling, the buzz, the positivity, creativity, the list goes on. I just find that now it is getting in the way. I kind of want someone to tell me that my problem is with my dad preventing me from relaxing not the smoking, because if I lived alone I would have that freedom. I find myself in a much better headspace when I smoke, even being a better parent at times. I'm at a loss. My husband smokes and says he will never stop which makes it harder. Especially since we smoke together mostly, and before bed. I stopped smoking while pregnant and for a year after but then I picked it up again and I've had these issues around my dad. For instance, today I went out to the park and on a walk with my youngest for a few hours. Thinking he would nap when we got home and that my dad wouldn't be home, I expected to have a smoke while he napped and before I need to pick up my other son. My dad is home, youngest didn't sleep, now I'm pissed. I was so angry for 20min but then I accepted that it wasn't happening and now I'm okay. Is that an addiction? Or would I still be angry if it was an addiction? I don't know what I'm looking for here. It just dawned me on that I may have an addiction to deal with, but I also enjoy smoking SO much. Any advice?

addiction,Grammerr909,2019/03/29,"Cycle of sickness Haven't been able to shake meth addiction since my first use (20 years ago) and jail, rehab, voices in my head nor pain I cause to everyone around me motivates me to quit. I have been drinking a lot of booze to make coming off of meth manageable and end up using again because I'm fucked-up enough to rationalize using again as a good idea or even something I ""need."" My life is so empty and depressing that cleaning-up and living it seems like a much less attractive option than continuing the cycle which provides me with comforting distraction at the price of continuing misery and guilt. Tried almost everything. My drinking has frequent social consequences that have almost killed me and repeatedly taken my freedom from me. My meth use evolved long ago from sex and hotel rooms to debilitating voices and psychotic delusions that have alienated everyone in my life and isolated me in complete darkness. I feel hopeless as if I've drifted so far away from everything which brings purpose to life that I've become a foreigner to social convention and vacant of any relatable identity to everyone who's path I cross. Every morning I hit the booze to avoid the come down off meth and continue to drink so much throughout the day that I give in to the obsession again that same day while behaving recklessly enough to create more regret and cause more offense to others. I'd like to hear from others who are in the same place and people that have made it out and what it took because I'm literally sick of life",10.999122497055357,8.70791642402827,10.077464664310957,64.81664458186103,57.90459363957597,13.6736160188457,41.25117785630153,12.161744961471696,5.007497290930506,1240,50,208,30,12,395,160,283,0.133,0.794,0.073,-0.9424,0,1,8,0,0,1,16.0,0,0,0,3,8,16,2,5,11,0,10,16,1,9,0,42,29,23,1,3,2,0,1,2,0,0,9,3,1,0,17,19,5,1,4,4,1,7,2,11,0,1,5,4,20,5,42,23,10,40,1,3,0,1,6,16,0,7,19,136,37,2,0.10101019060650393,0.0,0.0,0.11011601742520652,0.0,0.0,0.17907887873302786,0.0,0.20229423000122154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06869039339945053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992048504380662,0.0,0.0,0.09490239912695582,0.0,0.0,0.12314974930206332,0.11155781955725316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20753058058090731,0.0,0.17402267030796753,0.10590726305162106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13028643315324012,0.0,0.08699992915769962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968545954395501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08946504746438609,0.20874105724493866,0.0,0.06671627824579959,0.0,0.08510544211977754,0.2895586974634065,0.18156289228487293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051073787387288336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08591921652881243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689817897805646,0.0,0.08472255548470216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10366559700296853,0.0,0.11384582601057235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402821019208514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11175281000128023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2853859394064119,0.09869695381706356,0.0,0.08919384889802251,0.08939084008142778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08587525189505081,0.0,0.09557828467610754,0.06742508658682593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14850822495454322,0.07489777643924485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074819645532842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07002774779744839,0.0,0.10553415026064013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10743677130014236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091955883850716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08355667348020837,0.0,0.0,0.205934337620156,0.0,0.07776257964030397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11222603841073796,0.06857928893876565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34896149216451045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504725100140164
addiction,kaybabyfabe,2019/03/29,"im addicted to tv/certain tv shows I watched the vampire diaries for years while it aired and i am still so attached to the show. objectively, it's not a high quality show but in my mind, it's a 10/10. i am just obsessed with watching shows in general and i know it's a form of escapism, but i get very antsy when i dont have anything to watch. i have severe anxiety so i would rather focus on a fictional world than my own sad life and my thoughts. these issues are accompanied by phone and internet addiction as well. i feel as if i have an obsessive personality. i am a 0 or 100 person.

addiction,BirdsAteMyFace--,2019/03/29,"I need help quitting I need help. I have been struggling with my addiction for years and I don't know how to stop. The most I get is a few weeks to a few months clean before I relapse again. Cocaine and weed is what I struggle with. I have smoked weed for 10 years daily and cocaine I've struggled with for the past 5 years. I'm scared to tell my parents. One of my sister's went to rehab three years ago for being an alcoholic and I don't want to put my parents through something like that again or have them spend 20k to put me in rehab. I have told this sister that I have an addiction and attended one NA meeting with her. Didn't really like it. 
I have talked to my doctor as well. I feel like I need to go to rehab to help myself but I could never ask anyone to pay for that. 
I live in Canada. I don't know what to do, but I obviously can't fight this alone since I keep relapsing. 
What do i do?

addiction,CrabRangoonSlut,2019/03/29,"Is my roommate addicted to TV? To begin, I’ve known her for about 2 years and she’s always been a big fan of TV. Lately, it’s been getting a little out of hand.

To start out, there are 4 girls (including me) who live in an apartment. Everyone mostly does their fair share of cleaning...except for her. Once she’s done for the day, she will literally sit in front of the TV and watch shows nonstop until it is time to go to bed. The only time she will get up is to make food and go to the bathroom.

On the weekends, it’s worse, she wakes up at 9 am and sits in the same spot until 9 pm.

She always invites me to watch TV with her, but I have a short attention span so I’ll get up and do other things sometimes or I’ll bring work with me to the couch. 

Last night I sort of confronted her, I told her she’s addicted and she watches way too much TV and it’s not that healthy. She responded with that TV is her “escape from reality” and that her “reality sucks” because she doesn’t have a boyfriend and that I never want to go out either so she can’t gwt one.

I told her, go out and get one. Socialize without me! Besides, if I did go out with her and accompany her, I’d do 95% of the talking anyways since she doesn’t really want to talk. She just wants some boy to magically go up to her and whisk her away. 

She started blaming me for her lack of socialization too, saying I always went home on the weekends and that she was all alone, and I have a boyfriend and I go out to see him, thus forcing her to go on the TV to escape her boredom.

Am I being unreasonable here? I am not responsible for her entertainment 100% of the time, but I feel like I should help her break her TV habit. Is this addiction harmless, or will it have dire effects down the road?",3.299782016348775,3.892700373297004,4.732475204359677,87.27975912806541,72.5149863760218,7.9428446866485025,26.396621253406,8.109356740369918,1.356607716621253,1355,43,308,19,25,454,179,367,0.091,0.843,0.065,-0.8885,0,2,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,1,2,9,6,2,0,18,0,28,6,2,3,2,52,54,24,0,6,10,0,2,1,0,4,3,1,3,2,14,25,1,0,4,12,0,11,7,2,0,2,8,7,54,4,57,41,7,56,0,0,4,0,48,25,1,6,17,211,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34890677743519893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049335423530138,0.0,0.0,0.2663110827275922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10023395029018896,0.0,0.0,0.06503410853333291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880291744099133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09336065153687943,0.1091756655539667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10194196829106704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053943077448029016,0.0762156947820629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12900377223408274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22295377211514228,0.0,0.4850517762741422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07150862173351534,0.0,0.10701362644455012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696241075692264,0.1203451839166545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052120840219531964,0.10692627014024504,0.09420469765653848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07121298133058462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842565717366479,0.0,0.0822819511810755,0.0,0.0,0.10011652653412656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361590821692953,0.1445848623104689,0.08113865352775784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0683450616402612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484009324305414,0.0,0.0,0.08501403146056745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825082962154414,0.0,0.0,0.21750358631554048,0.0,0.0,0.10551406759101624,0.0,0.1510242048117045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17149851996949314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07087668931032662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866264226255392,0.0,0.0,0.20388393658213408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1887765070964944,0.08468148663110181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09889794635302317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284041077549297,0.0,0.07766785835262283,0.0,0.10872100020773558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870156058611199
addiction,Bgbankz,2019/03/29,"Need to stop drugs before it takes ruins my life Most of my life I have spent thinking drugs are bad. They are very fun and now I have recently learned that it could destroy my life on many levels. I started as a heavy weed smoker and had a notion in my head that the only drug that I would ever do in my life. For many years I was around potheads smoke weed almost every breathing second I had until I meet others that had the same interest in my pot smoking. Soon enough I had befriended these people and for the most part very friendly and nice, Unassuming not knowing their activities outside of just smoking pot. The more I spent time with my new friends they started to introduce me to new drugs that I have never heard of nor thought existed. At first, I politely pass and let them do their things. I am a firm believer in trying new thing at least once and as time passed I started to take small doses of whatever they had at the time. It was a life-changing experience, to say the least. I thought I would never get hooked on any type of drugs until I understood why people are addicted to drugs. I started to take Xanax to help me sleep at night because I had sleep problems. It helped for a good few months until I would stay awake after I have ingested them. When I took one during the day I learned that it had a euphoric feeling to it so I started to eat them just to get feel that feeling again. Before I knew it I was taking anywhere between 5-7 pills a day (2-4 mg each pill). It would not have been a problem but I work at a coffee shop and customers would complain that there was a guy that was working who seems a bit off and acted in strange ways. I had a talk with the boss and I stopped taking Xanax. Then coke was introduced into my life. Coke had changed my drugs drastically. I would say I have some self-control but coke was a beast that I cannot contain. I spend most of my money on it and whatever I can scrape up I would buy as much as I can (and still do). I see a problem that is occurring. Now that I know what drugs are I can say that I do it as a hobby but the hobby had started to change my life in a direction that is not conducive to my future. It had gotten me into debt with several dealers, I am on the fridge of being fired from my job and I can see it controlling my life. If I have any sense of self-awareness at all the signs are there proving that I have lost control over my life and my motives are to do drugs. I do not know what I need to do to stop this bad habit and I hope someone here can give me some advice or lead me in the right direction so this problem does not ruin my life.",3.2260082872928213,4.326271248618788,4.1554470534069985,89.44864019337021,73.1620626151013,7.050626151012891,26.098020257826892,7.365786028017652,1.1170972744014729,2060,68,446,22,40,665,238,543,0.07,0.862,0.068,-0.6522,2,0,11,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,8,8,15,18,1,0,28,0,60,34,4,5,5,84,97,32,0,16,12,0,4,0,2,7,26,4,0,1,36,21,5,6,16,1,7,5,9,11,0,3,29,10,76,7,64,58,16,70,0,3,2,0,22,26,0,10,37,324,112,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05721684852967843,0.0,0.051288139235411034,0.0,0.0,0.05255656073953818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07138376280725743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046723146121419486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764625694717601,0.03199462129598905,0.0,0.08932244336664183,0.059133088555037336,0.0,0.0,0.05730047861674775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16656782646648974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17660056458520385,0.041905332398377564,0.0,0.0,0.0676975001957762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04593033959000551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5477977562748804,0.05370568164349527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05423146302226608,0.0,0.0,0.04747606191885672,0.04422122507405506,0.0,0.0,0.0513408061714248,0.0,0.0,0.07961460716903503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044644066438897415,0.0,0.0,0.08110020150793715,0.0,0.0548429252449895,0.05034879174734855,0.0,0.04402227521085258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05196881172456511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05386517693019818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07035973348014167,0.0,0.0,0.052129858841296665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052083674882558106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865338329657607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053669891934037255,0.3707200017156366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057294029535934474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10642394401383964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041893356811099035,0.0,0.03858281842787765,0.07783453906049133,0.08095997398608927,0.15207222004532098,0.0,0.049254005692834835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055895253099953836,0.03556547494139303,0.039917522522147135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05683658882647032,0.0,0.07277355524272608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20088581201408706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05182301455667136,0.0,0.0,0.04482225688366348,0.0,0.12521552375719816,0.0,0.0,0.08364815948947886,0.0477807498012068,0.10950746714279998,0.059293578577239325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504663691820372,0.0,0.04447072106287879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2228966775335334,0.05594246804612723,0.04191491951497957,0.13164046903858198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973124976420009,0.04218578775808235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0697379539548879,0.033630534100420224,0.0,0.08333511226840534,0.09181400115093298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05831322627695393,0.035634150954901786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.086611926733654,0.0,0.0416604787340907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04735992266000781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07642001315629741,0.0,0.0,0.2609889261788286,0.0,0.0,0.03379888589184682
addiction,lordkhole,2019/03/29,"Need to stop making excuses. I've been an addict since I was 16. My first experience with alcohol was at age 14, black out, puking. Weed at 15. Began selling weed my junior/senior year of high school. I would sell an ounce a week and smoke an ounce a week, no profit just supporting the addiction.  I had an adderall prescription and my ""friend"" sold xanax which I would take regularly until he got fake bars that were roofies and I did something I still dread to this day.. I ate mushrooms and smoked dmt a few times in those years but nothing to heavy. I started drinking heavy after graduating high school. Age 19 got into acid, mdma, mda and experimented with coke a little.   I'm now 22 and the last year I've limited my substance intake a lot, tripping a few times a year, rolling every two or three months minimum.  From age 19 to 21 it was twice or more a month.  My problem now is I'm 22 living as a cook in one of the biggest drinking towns in America. I make excuses like oh im 22, I live down town, i work nights I might as well drink heavy 6 nights a week.  I have a beautiful, loving, supporting girlfriend who doesnt like the binge drinking. I don't either.  I just dont know how to stop. I justify it and make excuses but that's it. Just excuses. I need to stop. I drink to socialize and I'm a social person. But I need to be happy by myself and the blessing of the company of my partner. I need to stop making excuses.

addiction,Jp42022,2019/03/29,"How to beat a nicotine addiction I will be turning 17 in a month I have been vaping since I was 12 through friends but when I turned 16 and got my license I started buying stuff and getting people to get it for me, I used to smoke cigarettes when I was 14 and 15 but when I was able to access Vapes I started doing that and getting higher and higher mg amounts. I have tried quiting but I always seem to go back, part of the reasons that bring me back are with friends that also use nicotine and also the amount of money I've spent on it. I have spent well over $300 on vaping items and I just think it's 300 waisted and keep doing it. I am scared for what it will do to my health later in life and I don't know how to quit.

addiction,carneadevada,2019/03/30,"I fucked up and my perfect dog sufferd for it. I have not been sober. I thought my cocaine use was under control. Today I'm realizing there is no control in addiction. I had not eaten between Wednesday and today. I finally ate and showered today. I have spent $600 and forgot about my wonderful dog that I left at home. I forgot to let my roommates know that she was in my room. The guilt I'm feeling is unreal. I spent most of my paycheck and hurt my best friend. I am ashamed but I know this has given me the push to get sober again. Hurting myself is bad enough. Hurting my dog is unacceptable. I need help. I would love some words of encouragement or even a good scolding. I know that I can be better than this. I am better than this. I will get better. I will get clean and live my best life. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to put this somewhere.

First time poster and full disclosure I'm a bit drunk at the moment but I came across you guys and I figured maybe I could find help from someone on here. I'm not great in the head for multiple reasons (shoutout youth) and I turn to drinks to kind of null the pain although it's not even really pain anymore. More like a habit, shit i don't know anymore. I'm just kind of going downhill again and don't know what to do. I'm losing faith that I can fix this but hell maybe the internet holds the answers I need.

addiction,slammed_sam,2019/03/30,"It gets better... Hello all and if your reading this I believe its because your supposed to be and I hope it can help you through a tough time. 
I was a heroin/meth addict along with anything else that could be put in my arm and I was sent away to a rehab. Many of times actually. My final rehab was a very extreme Christian rehab that was quite easy to say a cult in Christian form. I stayed 9 months got clean and moved to orange county where within a year I met my now wife. She has completely changed my life. Let me tell you...

I met my wife at a bar in San Clemente California and I thought she was great and she enjoyed spending time with me. I had a job and a car at the time...it was like our 4 or 5th date I was supposed to go pick her up from her house. I was not expecting the house I pulled up 2. It was HUGE overlooking Laguna beach in a nice secluded gated neighborhood. I was in awe... I quickly realized what I was dealing wit...h I mean I was picking her up in a 96 buick Skylark that cost me $1000. Surrounded by beamers and Benz I thought I was toast... I couldn't understand why she would go out with literally a piece of shit. I later found out how wealthy her family is. Long story short I'm now happily married to this woman and we have 2 beautiful children. 
I went from literally being a homeless feind to partying it up in Laguna beach with a buncha rich kids. I know this sounds petty. But from my angle I literally thought I was going to die a broke addict. And now I don't even think about drugs... money never is an issue anymore and I'm happily in love. Sounds like its 2 good to be true but it could happen to anyone. Keep your head up and know it gets better. It could happen to you!

&amp;#x200B;

I am a senior from Lourdes University. As part of my program, I need to conduct a research project on my own. I have chosen to investigate the correlation between mixed parenting styles and the development of addictive behaviors. This comes in the form of a quick survey that is completely anonymous. My goal is to reach 500 participants. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will be grateful to anyone who shares some of their time and personal experience/insight with me.

 My entire life from childhood to adualthood has been dictated by my debilitating anxiety. 
 After dropping out freshmen year I spent 6 years in isolation, with no interaction outside of my grandmother whom I live with. This has stunted my growth socially.

I began using Xanax after 6 years of isolation in an attempt to seek help. I was prescribed 3 ssri's to no avail. I've seen a psych, a therapist, doctors, all to no avail. 

I used for 2 years straight, in the beginning it was merely a tool to seek out professionals that could help, it didn't work.

It had gotten so bad I had purchased a Glock 20 online to be shipped to my local Cabela's. The same day I was to pick it up I took 10 2mg Xanax. I had forgotten I had a therapist appointment that same day, and I went. 

Being disinhibited as I was, I let it all slip. Social workers were called, I was takken to rrc in King county, from there to the hospital where I had a seizure within 24 hours. The day before my discharge I was approached by a social worker who game me the option to go to rehab willingly or to take me into state custody. I went voluntarily.

I got out five days later. Fast forward 5 months of complete isolation and I've managed to re-up.

They put me on 3 different ssri medications to no avail.


I have had 3 beers and .75 mg flubromazolam tonight.

 The last time I took this drug I blacked out and ended up a city over in Seattle, where many more poor choices ensued that resulted in hospitalization and being robbed.

I know I can't do this, and every day suicide crosses my mind (many attempts have been made in the past). 

I don't know what to do. I need help. But rehab made no attempt to address my root problems, my therapist couldn't get through to me. 

I've considered formic acid and sulphuric acid as a means of suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning, but I want to get better and stop being a burden.

I just don't know how. I need help.

How can I abandon benzodiazepines when they were the only thing that helped me get out?

I'm lost.",3.8028756653473437,5.452780359628768,5.287930257950048,79.72893919748874,72.54988399071925,8.31884809608298,28.68575133069469,8.925248442259385,2.3809559983622224,1729,69,331,35,34,582,222,431,0.116,0.836,0.048,-0.9696,1,3,2,0,0,2,50.0,0,0,2,9,9,8,1,0,19,0,38,14,0,9,2,50,70,19,2,6,4,0,0,0,0,1,13,0,1,0,16,18,1,2,5,2,3,11,11,7,0,1,30,4,46,1,59,32,5,64,0,3,2,0,16,25,0,2,28,211,62,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971872469559452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06819991855232832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07443697649889854,0.0,0.0,0.0758605427008043,0.0,0.0,0.07884640727326356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091032668257927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347264430097364,0.0,0.0,0.0711794513893857,0.0,0.0,0.28747361305710256,0.0,0.07678522886956135,0.0904859207901468,0.0,0.0931433388483485,0.0,0.0912493546101496,0.0,0.0,0.10448376810652127,0.0,0.10338632217044012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07896091654197727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511317439542975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1863099089355312,0.0,0.1013326119236754,0.0,0.07130183033871318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35853436369929226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08779532320651326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19597921965533466,0.07266958829729588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09116246657287687,0.06296966240557203,0.0,0.0,0.0787215595196333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973183448704244,0.0,0.0,0.1687127917199113,0.0,0.18076930824901632,0.0,0.09711107267896348,0.0,0.0898097892370497,0.0,0.0,0.09001663073574133,0.0,0.07115910992724317,0.0,0.0,0.1322079905440861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06780300241837213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510427736011136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08530502607126196,0.0,0.08962091554539085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726332434869417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07453384275561757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19503244056256167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703011063561375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310531942229872,0.05922765695230886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051984396398208434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1980990588825107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539948842598809,0.0,0.0,0.05258329789273065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16528688619295515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06490265439161018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2870501219848633

But i havent fucked with meth again. Meth was my everyday shit for 10 years. And now it's not. And hasn't been for almost 7 fucking years. And I don't miss it. But watching him smoke just now... I could fucking taste it. And that's too close for comfort for me. I feel sad- for him because he never got better. I feel sad- for myself because I'm not strong enough to keep watching it. 

 I rarely have hardcore struggle moments anymore, but I still have them occasionally (obviously). To anyone out there that's struggling- it gets better but never entirely goes away. Watch your ass and stay clean- it's fucking worth it. Most importantly- you're not alone.

addiction,Thelongwayaround,2019/03/30,"My ten years sober and what got me there. 
I’m an addict. I’ve known I was going to be one ever since I was a kid. There was nothing romantic about the idea. I knew from the first time someone explained what it was that my future would be filled with whatever that addiction would bring.

I started drinking at the age of twelve. Smoking at thirteen. Pot and inhalants at about 15. All the while taking and abusing meds for ADD and depression. I’ve hurt people and broken relationships past the point of repair. I’ve set my life back countless years by giving in to my addiction. And I did all of this before I was 22. 

22 was the age when my soon to be wife looked at me with a worried pity fear at the man that had already finished 750s and god knows what else lying fulling clothed in the shower at 10am. She didn’t say anything. It was up to me to say it out loud and admit that I’m an addict and that I wanted to to quit.

And that’s where it started.

I am ten years sober this year and it began with actually wanting to quit. Over the years since I developed guidelines that have worked for me so far. If they help someone outside of myself good if these just sound like more self help aphorisms that are blatantly obvious then you are smarter than me and don’t need them. I did and still do need them.

1. You have to want to quit.
All the self-help books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you don’t actually want to quit.

2. Find a reason to quit.
Any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable. 

3. Redirect the the urge to something good. 
As an addict I have the new superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something it gives me joy. Replacing the bad behaviors with something beneficial can help help while keeping you busy.

4. Never get bored.
I’m a machine of habit when I get bored I get back into whatever habit that’s easiest for me. 

5. If need be, remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction. 
This one sucks. It sucks because you’re losing part of your support structure of the people around you, but when the people around you aren’t helping you then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out.

6. Find anything that works for you.
What works for you may not help someone else. What works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then that’s what I need to do.


That’s my list. Again these may be things you’ve heard before. These may be things that you’ve thought of yourself and  didn’t quite work,but this is what has worked for me. Something that some non-addicts don’t seem to get is that you can never stop quitting and that you will always be thinking about going back. One day if you’re lucky you might be able to look back at 10 years of being clean and remember that last time and what it took to stop. You won’t feel that amazing bliss or mindless joy but you’ll feel real contented happiness at the person you are and how much better things are for you in that day.

addiction,Gilly096,2019/03/30,Shopping addiction I’m currently in high school and recovering from what a believe was an addiction to shopping. Basically before sophomore year I never cared about what I wore. However after being rejected by a girl I liked at the time I started shopping for clothes to change my self into someone I wasn’t. After a while I still didn’t feel satisfied wearing these clothes so I constantly begged my mom to take me shopping again. It got to the point where every week I would someone how convince one of my parents to buy clothes for me or attempt to at least. After a while I still wasn’t satisfied and I just completely shut down in school. By the middle of sophomore year I had enticed wardrobes filled with a mismatch of poorly fitting clothes from multiple different attempts at creating different styles( each one I didn’t like) eventually I mentally shut down and showed up to school wearing whatever I could find in my wardrobe. It didn’t help that I was always high in school and I rarely showered or did my hair. So basically I would show up to school as this zombie that my own friends couldn’t even recognize. Eventually everyone stopped talking to me and this has continued up till maybe a month ago when I suddenly snapped out of it and realized I wasted so much money on all these outfits when I never actually gave a crap about clothes. I’m now giving away thousands of dollars of clothes to charity because I feel like an idiot with them just lying around ,8.145869565217389,8.02793836956522,7.789623188405795,71.98726086956525,62.04347826086956,11.273043478260867,41.22608695652174,10.793553405168565,4.614306086956521,1194,63,206,27,15,379,150,276,0.065,0.83,0.105,0.8339,7,1,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,2,17,9,2,0,12,0,15,6,4,1,3,29,26,18,0,4,4,2,3,3,1,2,2,0,1,2,11,12,0,1,4,6,8,1,8,3,0,3,12,3,31,6,48,9,5,52,0,1,0,0,10,25,1,2,29,151,42,5,0.0,0.0,0.10621761831640812,0.23731557144584114,0.0,0.0,0.0964850696431943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056827047677088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689567327184036,0.0,0.0,0.10226403754427543,0.0,0.0,0.06635127616398269,0.0,0.0926196008484204,0.12263173402950688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11097535788379173,0.0,0.11514422743819044,0.0,0.11412255564196967,0.11762344086593192,0.0,0.08690436611158793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22744100051716976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189150164913884,0.0,0.09170712445863816,0.10400664886970366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11007122599534927,0.07775932855176335,0.0,0.0,0.099482919498419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08409385154814092,0.0,0.0,0.10441463128585234,0.0,0.0,0.08705378093298809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295692084891706,0.2300027349383135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15952940732011975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10935004933538496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10969077837858557,0.0,0.0,0.1274786678695839,0.08687953082782594,0.0,0.08001405039333415,0.0,0.16789689562143026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475132102929694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12086017358848353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102894287455674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5507878629359108,0.0,0.0,0.11354971398459815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18444907143341746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07704148597478855,0.0,0.17384849624572146,0.0909998072772954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183835589446924,0.08748598171663884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06346875296869027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08730938626622459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546416028264784,0.0,0.0,0.14018601383639478
addiction,StonedNixon,2019/03/31,"Did meth three times... It's completely ruined my life. Five months ago I ingested three huge doses of meth over the course of a weekend while completely plastered on booze at a party. I haven't used since but the fact of the matter is I've been completely miserable from that weekend on. Every day is a chore to get through as I can't stop thinking about it. Focusing alone is incredibly difficult.
Relapse is not an option as I can't drag my parents or brother into a meth addiction. That would be a savagely evil thing for me to do... With that being the case I don't really see the point in living much longer. My Central nervous system has been permanently altered to where I cant even get a job. I'm mentally handicapped now and incapable of even having the slightest peace of mind.
The only time I feel slightly okay is when I'm exercising or playing video games. Even then those are more brief distractions than anything. Moody, unresponsive, obsessive compulsive. Life is a living hell I've created in my own mind. Struggle daily, it never ends. It never ends. I want to die so badly. Maybe lay down on some train tracks or jump in front of a truck. Why haven't they made anyway to ease this pain?! Please, I need help!",3.372365177195686,5.707902415254239,4.343636363636364,83.02732665639448,75.6949152542373,7.850231124807397,25.981510015408322,8.710501217029153,2.097116949152542,974,36,182,21,22,315,157,236,0.223,0.6659999999999999,0.111,-0.9892,2,1,3,0,0,1,30.0,0,0,1,0,9,14,2,5,16,1,22,8,0,2,3,24,33,11,1,3,5,2,1,0,0,1,7,0,1,0,10,3,2,1,2,6,0,3,9,12,0,3,4,2,15,2,29,26,4,33,1,2,1,0,5,13,1,5,16,117,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14597519590529434,0.0,0.0,0.11869787437286244,0.0,0.0,0.13868422805624772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101916361843154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11180430115434818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211875937736657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08635704436125356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13897127881402035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371985136342343,0.0,0.0,0.26532711629216804,0.0,0.1128199500538549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06770591866481848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13991869462199036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08975307223780872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328791228427311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18916080234087387,0.0,0.0,0.2364794853805827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12670326403116938,0.0,0.0,0.13452463128934855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13494380301523914,0.0,0.27040986791900395,0.0,0.1068809472171212,0.0,0.0984348950233854,0.0992881675548774,0.2065501398067534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10184007543166196,0.14248336616976173,0.0,0.14868461777909972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14698645280742392,0.12658262310701734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08578237289141917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670420324059228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076682634978843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11194979422307956,0.0,0.13998560249747874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08895991086715282,0.08580031808571395,0.0,0.0,0.1561610743369812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11565011924064032,0.0,0.0,0.07898008691116913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12082759127791275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09512160592822952,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,chloemorganv,2019/03/31,"Rainbow baby The boyfriend I had while I was working at the club was older too. He was nice but he was crazy. He needed to be on medication but wouldn’t take it. I got pregnant once while I was working at the club. I knew before I even read the test results that I was. I felt it. It could have been his it could have been a lot of other people’s. You might think I’m disgusting talking about my history like this but it’s the reality of where my addiction brought me too. A place I would have never imagined getting to. I kept doing IV heroin and cocaine and anything else that was offered to me at the club and one night woke up with horrible cramps and I was bleeding. I cried and cried and my boyfriend blew it off. I lost my baby in my shower. I lost my baby as a direct result of my drug use. They call babies you lose rainbow babies I think, or that’s what the one after that is called. . I cried and went back to work the next day. I cried as I told one of my regulars what happened, in between lines of drugs. I ended up moving into his house a couple months after that. He was nice but more importantly he had a lot of money and bought me nice things... and lots of drugs. I got him hooked on heroin too.

After moving in with him my life quickly turned from dancing and drugs to just drugs. I sat in bed and got high all day until he came home from work. Then he would make me take my pants off and have sex. It wasn’t an option, he made that very clear. I was not allowed to sleep with pants on, was not allowed to drive around with a condom in the car (his way of making me believe that I was such a whore that a trip to the store could end up getting me pregnant if I didn’t carry that condom everywhere with me), could not talk to my parents if it wasn’t on speaker phone.

The longer he was on drugs the meaner and scarier he got. He would hold all my money and he threw all my clothes away so I couldn’t leave. If I would try and run away and he would chase me down, pick me up and lock me back in the house. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get high until I gave him a blow job. He would choke me so hard I would puke. He would say “just puke over the side of the bed, don’t get it on me bitch”.

addiction,D1gsDags,2019/03/31,"Is weed addictive? I believe it is. 
Weed IS addictive.   

For those of you who smoke:

-how did you start?
-How often do you?
-Why do you?
-what time do you get up the next day?
-Do you have a job?
-How long have you had the same job?
-How many times have you been late because of smoking the night before?
-how often do you shower?
-how many friends do you have?
- how many of them smoke?
-how many times a week did you smoke when you started?
-how many times a week do you smoke now?

I’ve seen changes on many, 

-from attending college and doing great to losing all classes for not showing up.
-from having a job to losing it for being late and at the end for showing up stoned.
-From being clean cut to not taking care of themselves.
-from showering sometimes twice a week to now having oily hair and being stinky all the time.
-from going to the gym - even when attending college full time to exercising only when trying to stop smoking, but fail each time.
-from hanging out with family and friends to just hanging out with the few friends that smoke.
-drinking a beer once in a while to smoking all the time and then started smoking and added drinking to the mix.
-I’ve seen someone finish college;  career never really taken off because of weed.  This someone also got married and getting the wife to smoke with him, but the wife got pregnant so she stopped.  During this time he went from being a manager somewhere to doing odd jobs to getting into a wreck stoned, leaving the car wherever he wrecked and loosing it because he couldn’t afford to get out of the pound.   To losing his drivers license because he fell asleep behind the wheel in the middle of the road on his way to work after smoking the night before.  The wife finally left with the children. 

Does any of these sound familiar?

I do think weed has caused accidents, it’s just not checked for as when they check for alcohol.

addiction,gallifreyss,2019/03/31,"Trying to taper off ambien.. how long does it take? I’ve been on ambien for about 3-4 weeks now and I want to stop. The rebound insomnia is not worth it. First, a little history: when I first started taking it @10mg, within the same first week I double dozed to 20mg most days (I know I shouldn’t have now because my mom told me I had a small seizure one night). 

Around week 2 I was prescribed elavil @25mg for my depression and ambien together and I slept for 13 hours which was fucking great. Because even before I was introduced to ambien, I was only sleeping for 4 hours. 

Week 3/4 I am dependent on ambien. This is day two of my tapering down to 5mg. I’ve only been getting 2-3 hours of sleep which is better than no sleep but I’m also scared about rebound insomnia/seizures. 

I know it’s only been a month, but how long will it be, approx until I can fully sleep on my own? Should I consider in patient detoxing ?

addiction,allyjayrey,2019/04/01,"Question, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, if not, please redirect me. To be very brief, I found meth on my husband. He was sleeping on top of it in the guest bed. (I wasnt snooping  I came I  to wake him for work) 
 He claims he only used it once. It had a full baggie and a pipe that looked moderately used. 

We have a daughter who is an infant. I established separation (he broke down the bedroom door I was behind right after discovery as he was raging and I walked away from him.) I did not call the cops. 

This was over a month and a half ago. A week ago he took a pee test for me and it came back positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine as well as pot. The pot I would not typically have a problem with as we are in a legal state, however he is refusing treatment and I believe the pot is enabling him to continue his delusions of being okay.

He claimed he has  not used since that night and that he was not using before. 

I told him I would believe him on the grounds he took a subsequent drug test in a week and it was clean. 

Today is the day and he is making excuses as to why he is busy. 

The agreement was, if he submits to the drug test and if not clean gets help, I will not demand full custody permanently and we will work through for 6 months with our agreed upon supervised visitation. (There is noone enforcing this, bit he has been compliant) 

If he does not take the test or tests positive for drugs and refuses help, I will sue him for divorce and request full custody and be prepared to go before a judge and hire an attorney if necessary. 

He has asked to take the test in a couple more days. Claiming he is clean.... 

My love for him blinds me, and I have tried and tried to be reasonable and give him multiple chances to be truthful and recieve help, I try not to condemn him for his addiction, and instead ask him to improve his reactions to his choices. 

Obviously I have no control over these things.... 

I just need to know, am I being dumb by giving him a couple more days? Would you believe he is still using meth given this small amount of knowledge?

I’ve held down a full time job, etc, the whole time so I am a functional addict - although I’m sure I could be a lot more functional.

As soon as I finish work I seek a high, is it half a gram of coke and a gram of ket? Is it 5 tramadols? Is it loads of codeine?

As I do my last line before I finish up so I can sleep for the night my brain goes, “ yeah we do that again tommorow aye mate” and I agree.

But lately as I get a bit older, now 27, I’m like Jesus Christ man, how long is this going to go on for?! What’s the deal with you

addiction,Picklebackbaby,2019/04/01,"[Day 3] Life without Adderall - I love petting my dogs. It’s so comforting. The peace and contentment is addictive. Their fur is so soft and I feel so close to them. I miss love. I miss loving my husband, enjoying quiet moments. I miss being passionate about things. I miss peace, contentment, excitement, anguish, sadness, all of the emotions that make us human. I miss my intelligence, being able to find the right words and get them out in the right order. I miss patience and empathy.

I can’t wait to be human again. I’m excited to the point of tears.

addiction,jaw8625,2019/04/01,"Thinking about getting clean again, but terrified I was a heroin addict in my early 20's, and ive been off the stuff for 7 years this november. The first three years I was completely sober, and honestly they were the best years of my life. After I got 3 years, I began drinking again, and managed it well for awhile. But now several years in I have developed a major problem with GABAergic drugs. And from what I understand, quitting them is 1000x harder than opioids. 

I currently take 2mg of clonopin a day for the past 2 years. If I reduce my dose at all, I get severe anxiety. I had been addicted physically to alcohol for the past 8 months as well, needing to drink by around 4pm to stave off withdrawals. Recently I have switched to GHB which is even worse. I am currently taking about 15ml a day of GHB plus 2mg klonopin. This is unsustainable.

Getting clean from opioids was the best thing I ever did, but the first 6 months were very uncomfortable. I was wrought with anxiety and uncertainty.

addiction,IssuesOverflowing,2019/04/01,"First post. no judgement please Hello, 

Ive been using meth for just about 2 years. I lost my job after about a year. I was a computer repair technician repairing Apple Computers in an authorized facility. My home life was the killer. My wife had developed trust issues, she believes I have have slept with another woman in our small town. (I dont blame her, I had been very secretive about my USE of meth) (also, I didn't cheat on my wife)  I am also an Entrepreneur. I have a small company that is doing OK as well. I am very recognized in my small community. I was very proud of my employmenship and my capabilities, and I loved helping the customers I had been meeting over the last 11 years since I lived here.

After I lost my job, We became hostile towards each other. a window was broken, a plant pot was knocked off the shelf, etc. I made the mistake of having a few drinks and the police took my licence for 3 months. (I can get it back now, just neets money and paperwork)

The RCMP (Canadian Police) were called a few times when my wife and I argued and the Ministry of Children and Family's were called in 4 times over that first year. I requested a marriage counselor each 'event' but I was told it was not available at the time. (RCMP call them if there are children present at an 'Event' that they attend) It was enough for the ministry of children and familys to put a protective order against me and tell me that I cannot go to my property when my wife is there. and also require an approved supervisor with me when I see them.

My wife was extremely concerned  that our children would be removed from our home and she made sure anything the RCMP had issue with are on me. I never told the police anything about MY  issues with my wife. I did not want her seen as a bad mother. (She works at a local elementary school) At this point I believe she is correct. I broke the window and broke a bowl and a coffee cup. I am the evil in the den.

&amp;#x200B;

Where to go from here?

The scary thing is I believe I have my life under control.

BUT If I play devils advocate and look from the other perspective, I am in a bad place.

I seem to have a problem demonizing the drug. Like I think its actually OK. Like the people that I get it from are not deserving of the hate that is spoken of them. Im not sure how I am rationalize it? Dont get me wrong. The ARE selling me METH at a profit.

BUT.

I miss my kids. I miss the routine I used to have that made me productive. I miss my wife. The weird thing is that the 'Towns people' are on my side. everybody I speak to says that she has been abusive and hurting me the entire relationship. (11 years) I cannot find a single person to stand up for her when I discuss my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to mention. I felt good about taking breaks from meth every once in a while, a couple weeks at a time. I thought it helped me maintain control. I now believe it does not help. It looks like most people do that and it still has a stranglehold on their life.

&amp;#x200B;

Im not sure If im expecting any solution or anything in any potential replies.

addiction,emptyskies1983,2019/04/01,"Nicotine withdrawls from someone with diagnosed anxiety/panic disorder. I started smoking when I was 14. I quit at 33. I used vaping as a means to quit. Took a while to get adjusted but it worked. I chained vape for nearly 3 years now and I kept getting sicker and sicker. I would start getting disoriented,dizzy, confused, all the symptoms of a stroke. I got an MRI done. Nothing.  I stopped vaping and it got better.

So we know vaping is a brain stimulant, so is smoking. Doing this all day every day affects the brain at night. Here it is...day 5 and I am feeling so freaking weird. I use a nicotine tablet every 2-5 hours and I'm getting triggers of depression, anxiety, can't focus on anything,lose interest to do anything. 

I just hope this is normal and goes away. When I beat the shit out of this addiction I ain't coming back to it.

addiction,Mclovin988,2019/04/02,"Advice on Early Cocaine Addiction (20M) I’ve been using blow for about two months on and off. It started as a once in a while thing with my buddy but after I tried doing it by myself I fiend it 24/7. 

The high is so unique in that it actually helps me function and get work done. I wouldn’t even want to quit if it weren’t for the money and the awful feeling I get in the morning. I got my paycheque last weekend and I’ve already spent about 300$ on it so far, even if I wanted to keep using I won’t be able to afford it.

When I’m fiending the only thing that helps is cigarettes or benzos. I’ve been addicted to speed and aderrall in the past and usually I just wound up replacing my addiction with some other vice. 

How can I fight off this addiction early before it starts ruining my life? Any advice is appreciated

addiction,curious-h08,2019/04/02,Having trouble with my addict boyfriend I have my boyfriend of seven years in recovery from heroin. He has been on methadone treatment for 1.5 years now and I don't see anything getting better. This being said he isn't on heroin but it almost feels worse. We argue a lot and he is so miserable always talking about wanting to kill himself. I am to the point of leaving him but feel like if I do it is kicking him while he is down. We have a daughter together and I feel horribly stuck. I don't have anyone to turn to because no one knows about his addiction. I guess I just needed to vent and some words of encouragement. ,3.636585365853655,5.408737414634151,4.460658536585368,84.9895243902439,73.22764227642277,6.871219512195122,28.56016260162602,7.554174236665415,1.7353811382113828,494,20,94,6,10,159,83,123,0.248,0.688,0.063,-0.9801,0,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,2,0,0,1,5,7,2,1,3,0,15,2,0,0,0,22,27,9,1,3,4,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,3,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,2,3,5,16,3,17,23,2,9,0,1,1,0,15,5,0,5,5,70,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43612893502191546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20030321009256594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16644269530718606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13986706493659706,0.0,0.1646093387282272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193768505977193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769120986109438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3034266542905535,0.1429029411879078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10450849354354602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22035786213457892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22130583338917648,0.0,0.10993238700527698,0.0,0.0,0.21180506556764328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772555883475366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1700601012889247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832123535590222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355468984078416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189094949541156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902762926861071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593996508553194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1607781899980888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21757743690628112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11798408962182193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038497548700825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25762817225580675
addiction,babymaybebaby,2019/04/02,"Not pregnant thus drunk I’ve been sober for the last 2 weeks because I thought I was pregnant. Today, miraculously, my period came. I’m not pregnant. My first thought? I can get drunk again. 

I’m never actually mentally sober. I might be sober for today. But realistically all I’m doing is planning for the next moment I get to drink without abandon. 

The moment I get even slightly buzzed I just want to get completely obliterated. I’m not in recovery. I’m in anticipation of the next opportunity. I just want to self destruct. 

Fuck booze. Also, pouring my next one.

addiction,azilliondollars,2019/04/02,"You ""cant"" get addicted to weed... I know most people don't believe it but I do. My family has a full spectrum of addictive tendencies and I was diagnosed with ADD ((97th percentile)) when I was 17. I started smoking shortly after. Went to college at Western Michigan for engineering and had a 3.9 gpa first semester. Second semester is where everything went down hill, I started smoking every day at least 3-4 times a day and didn't stop. I could barely keep a 1.8gpa... I dropped out and after one semester at Community College, dropped out again.

I've tried quitting but I always come right back and I can say with confidence that weed is ruining my life. I want to quit but I've tried so many times and never made any meaningful progress.

If anyone has any helpful advice I would greatly appreciate it. My habit has drawn the line between 6 figures and mounds of debt, all I have to do is cross it.

addiction,prtrhs,2019/04/02,"Need some help/advice Girlfriend’s brother has been abusing various benzos for years. Lost his job from using almost a year ago. Back in July, he drove us a few hours to a music festival while clearly under the influence. We’re talking couldn’t stay between the lines on the highway, would pull out his phone to watch twitter videos while speeding kind of stuff. Didn’t remember any of it later or think he was doing anything wrong of course, despite us having to constantly give him directions or grab the wheel in some cases. Was a total zombie the whole weekend despite being surrounded by friends and some of his favorite bands.

Fast forward to the past couple months. He started having seizures from withdrawal in between pick ups. He’d text friends and family late at night convinced he was on a mission in Syria combatting ISIS when really he was sitting on his couch. Messages are unbelievable to read. Complete mental break type shit. Finally checked himself into the hospital after we called to have a wellness check done. 

Few days later after he was out someone found him passed out on the road next to his car where he then spent another stint in the hospital. After this, he finally agreed to check into a treatment center and has been more or less clean (probably tapered down or something) for almost a month. 

Until a few nights ago, that is. He was using again hardcore and totaled his car into a highway barricade. Has a head injury and stitches and was checked in for suicide watch. Of course he doesn’t remember doing any of it and thought he had just parked his car in the hospital lot. Walked out of the hospital today without telling anyone (not the nurses, parents, nobody) and just showed up at home unannounced. He is clearly still in withdrawal and/or recovering from the head injury because his verb tenses are all messed up and he’ll switch wildly between emotional states.

We’re grasping at straws here. Anybody have any tips or resources for what might get through to him? He’s one of the neatest guys I know when sober and has a lot to give to the world but if he keeps making decisions like this we don’t know how long he’s got left.

addiction,Porterhaus,2019/04/02,"Need some help/advice Girlfriend’s brother has been abusing various benzos for years. Lost his job from using almost a year ago. Back in July, he drove us a few hours to a music festival while clearly under the influence. We’re talking couldn’t stay between the lines on the highway, would pull out his phone to watch twitter videos while speeding kind of stuff. Didn’t remember any of it later or think he was doing anything wrong of course, despite us having to constantly give him directions or grab the wheel in some cases. Was a total zombie the whole weekend despite being surrounded by friends and some of his favorite bands.

Fast forward to the past couple months. He started having seizures from withdrawal in between pick ups. He’d text friends and family late at night convinced he was on a mission in Syria combatting ISIS when really he was sitting on his couch. Messages are unbelievable to read. Complete mental break type shit. Finally checked himself into the hospital after we called to have a wellness check done. 

Few days later after he was out someone found him passed out on the road next to his car where he then spent another stint in the hospital. After this, he finally agreed to check into a treatment center and has been more or less clean (probably tapered down or something) for almost a month. 

Until a few nights ago, that is. He was using again hardcore and totaled his car into a highway barricade. Has a head injury and stitches and was checked in for suicide watch. Of course he doesn’t remember doing any of it and thought he had just parked his car in the hospital lot. Walked out of the hospital today without telling anyone (not the nurses, parents, nobody) and just showed up at home unannounced. He is clearly still in withdrawal and/or recovering from the head injury because his verb tenses are all messed up and he’ll switch wildly between emotional states.

We’re grasping at straws here. Anybody have any tips or resources for what might get through to him? He’s one of the neatest guys I know when sober and has a lot to give to the world but if he keeps making decisions like this we don’t know how long he’s got left. Willing to try anything at this point.

addiction,throwaway774428,2019/04/02,"What’s an addict? Idk what to make of my situation. Obvious throwaway. I’m nearing 30 and having a really hard time not going to sleep not on drugs or heavily drinking.  I’ve gotten high or drunk pretty much every night since I was 13 (every night I was able).  For the first 5 years that meant stealing scripts (pain killers and muscle relaxers), huffing paint thinner, ripping off friends for weed, taking a dozen Benadryl/CCCs, or drinking whatever I could.  Shortly before my dad dies, he catches me stealing pills and smoking weed, causing me to give up he former to this day.  I go to college where I smoke a gram day for 3 1/2 Years.  I want to blame it on losing my mother before 10, and losing my father before 18.   I’m functional and graduated from that Big 10 college early at 21. Then I live off of the rest of my inheritance- less than $10k a year -for the next few years with some odd shitty jobs paying ~1/2 my expenses to allow me to continue to be high for the majority of the that time.  The only good thing I have going for me is a long term relationship since I was 18.   Fast forward: I got my shit together ( I thought) and went to grad school, looking for a “real job” that pays more than $13/ hour.  I stopped smoking until the end of grad school when I found a hookup.  I move and have no access for a short min.  Everything’s okay until I move to a 420-legal state and start spending $200/ week on tree and drinking on a nightly basis.  No problem, until I quit my god-awful job and start depending on my gracious fiancée while ramping up my useage.  6 mos later, still no job, no applications out, a giant tax bill upcoming that I can’t pay.  I try to get sober. What I get is a constant urge to kill myself, ceaseless depression, and the inability to  stop making bad decisions.  It’s been a month and I keep buying, keep drinking.  Ideally I would just get a terminal illness. Instead I’m thinking about how it would be easiest to end it myself. I don’t want to do that bc I couldn’t hurt my so like that.  But I’m not happy ever. 

What should I do? No money for therapy but I know someone who will write me a script for anti-depressants.  I don’t know if I’ve repressed shit bout my parents or I’m just an addict.  But i feel like I’m depressed, I have anxiety issues, and addiction issues. 


Will someone put this into perspective for me? What’s going on? Am I basket case, addict, drunk, or just make-adjusted?",3.3849525988885283,4.916051699792965,4.90499346191566,82.53505802549854,73.40993788819874,7.56868257600523,27.61735861392612,8.20500826718156,1.9008211180124224,1893,72,367,30,38,636,261,483,0.154,0.797,0.05,-0.9899,5,0,6,0,0,1,74.0,0,0,0,5,11,22,3,1,25,1,25,17,3,6,2,64,59,30,2,10,15,4,2,2,1,5,8,0,0,0,20,16,6,5,8,7,10,10,12,14,0,2,10,3,49,8,54,40,8,71,0,5,1,0,11,22,2,8,42,223,69,15,0.07312181052101555,0.0,0.0,0.3188542666100601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055937984905380204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061053657484982066,0.0,0.0,0.18666382523267708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511624173480351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07901870017412158,0.0,0.058381815725156314,0.0,0.0,0.09431503713920092,0.0,0.1889391247659364,0.0,0.07588889487576897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28652614618636113,0.08479808556597487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12952844083680565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06614286391891541,0.1232165581635668,0.0,0.0657171683747283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036972584464002235,0.052238236046642086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0621973746748816,0.0,0.08017429103260107,0.056493729422043025,0.0,0.11460938401739527,0.07014510358332772,0.1662272400475114,0.06133110542422564,0.058482191678171036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783952699416274,0.06550277963952966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15451441496286442,0.0,0.0,0.0720102540961356,0.0,0.07827841050400397,0.0,0.0,0.1526403450822997,0.2902484562466029,0.12998804987065385,0.08089844944395648,0.0,0.08037166952359973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07144724619050523,0.0,0.0645678983437276,0.06471050130191212,0.061403904639083476,0.1636092042765123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14642812896882598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058365131535109825,0.15543382503331912,0.05375294423629793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07776587503795394,0.2058595973000478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05561243189620897,0.07780676186532914,0.0,0.08119311720072933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07439116906527607,0.0,0.06996769735239527,0.0,0.07350761595320525,0.0,0.0777740462306667,0.0,0.08322862877451878,0.04684370421073047,0.0,0.0,0.07850545942590391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14800635206883708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501169754223404,0.120974234565849,0.08219197870938405,0.07317461821807927,0.0,0.12391174553042494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035119876853362,0.0,0.058395172337376275,0.12226621554700902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497850139020318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08362116295975777,0.0,0.04857888177736222,0.04685350365256466,0.0,0.058050549768191566,0.08527583148965534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049644909502066736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625827673215775,0.0,0.05865390576034061,0.0,0.0,0.06778465092905285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388727245378797,0.0,0.0,0.1883521943312192
addiction,keylimepotato,2019/04/03,"I need to stop smoking marijuana. I always seem to fall back on it no matter what the situation is. I am flat broke because of it. I have no job currently and I’m at the point of breaking. I just think I owe it to myself to go without it. I’m not saying I’m quitting it forever, I just need to get back on my feet and go without it for like 6 months to see where it gets me.

I started smoking when I was 16-5years ago-and things never elevated since that first year. I just relied on smoking to get me a sense of happiness. Looking back, I wish I could’ve quit sooner to avoid what I turned into. I’m not saying it singlehandedly ruined my life, I just think it led me in the wrong direction. 

It is hard to find strength to do this so I’m really looking for some support to get the wheels turning. I want to get back on track so please, any type of encouragement is appreciated!",1.2156219806763282,3.1944508641304346,3.5955797101449285,87.49096618357491,81.11956521739131,6.480193236714977,23.265700483091784,7.594959193182576,1.0169272946859895,685,24,150,11,18,237,103,184,0.114,0.757,0.129,0.5681,3,1,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,4,12,9,0,1,5,0,7,2,1,1,1,25,34,5,0,4,8,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,15,3,0,2,4,0,1,4,7,4,0,1,1,6,21,5,27,33,1,26,0,2,3,0,3,9,0,2,13,96,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11324558076599242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10630096891718273,0.0,0.0,0.08687661603200103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.392937567966462,0.0,0.07787721801457992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10200060431942064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11676418990582747,0.10866688069082604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337290982716511,0.0,0.14521027419749855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13599574961354455,0.11444185188222797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12677542472859235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09023592474774313,0.0624138029784654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2145611712470192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197145487543396,0.0,0.0,0.18945488716374065,0.09853121070321592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14023474557447926,0.12076814976152822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27176269245344103,0.0,0.0,0.08184202698573921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20318908298651234,0.0,0.0,0.10180282949461178,0.11630179444052866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10567883920300003,0.14360004728242254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904244341073074,0.0,0.0,0.10680746837640492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14497291618457664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08487360725092231,0.1637182957632646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2779177820326525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535219866792138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469099752755152,0.24629921963386595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1396781643279133,0.0,0.08226892829574578
addiction,ghosttolteca,2019/04/03,"Getting Unstuck I know there are a plethora of aids and programs to help people with addiction- I applaud anyone taking serious steps to change. It’s SO hard sometimes. I found in my experience some of the group work it could be a nice distraction from the “itch” where as Pema Chodron in her series “getting unstuck” has helped me genuinely to me CORE learn how to deal with this WITHOUT using distractions at least twice during harmful habitual bouts. And has changed my (now sober) sisters life after a bout with meth. Worth a shot cuz with addiction is all about finding what works for YOU and gets you out of the cycle.

addiction,anonymouse676,2019/04/03,"A letter Hi everyone, last June I lost one of the most impactful people I’ve ever met in my life.... a romantic partner,  a friend, a spiritual teacher, to heroin, and I’m still grieving. Sometimes writing to him helps so I would like to post tonight’s letter..

I miss you so much, remembering such blissful child-like freedom, hopping into the shower after a night of no sleep, listening to the incredible string band and laughing at the silly-ness. The sun felt like it was touching me no matter where I was that day; even while I was very much indoors, I swear I felt the warmth on my skin. Thank you so much for sharing these moments with me. Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom with me. I feel so incredibly lucky to have experienced it within the brevity of your life. I do feel closer to you than before. Because now your energy and love isn’t limited to your physical location. I must wonder what it would have been like to be close to you again after all of these years. I imagine us holding our hands up to one another to measure. A perfect moment to admire each other’s faces. I remember those moments. I hope I never forget the color of your eyes or the lines that appeared when you looked at mine. Your absence has changed me. I mustn’t have known much about loss before you, J. You are gone. You are so gone. I can’t believe you are gone. You sweet, sweet soul. Making love under waterfalls: I would’ve planned for a love like ours to have lasted an eternity.

addiction,kindcosmos,2019/04/03,"no one can help me i've been taking codeine (400mg a day) for years. i get very sick without it, but the depression and anxiety is the worst. nothing helps.

my doctor says it's up to turning point (drug and alcohol addiction support) to deal with me. they say it's up to my doctor to taper me down. all they can do is prescribe methadone, which is more addictive than codeine! no one can help because they think it's someone else's job.

i already have a gastric ulcer from taking so many nsaids mixed with codeine. my liver will only hold out so long. i dunno if it will take liver failure for someone to actually help.

the doctor wouldn't even give me clonidine or sleeping tablets to get through cold turkey, because they're ""more addictive drugs."" even tho getting addicted takes time and they don't have euphoria, just make me sleep. i said ""please, i need help"" and she threatened to call the police, even tho i was not at all aggressive and she hadn't asked me politely to leave. i'm so upset and angry.",3.0734912577552147,5.253969380710662,3.7128510998307966,87.93654117315286,76.00507614213197,6.6112803158488465,27.695713479977442,7.594959193182576,1.6351649182177108,796,33,155,11,18,251,121,197,0.208,0.728,0.064,-0.9866,1,0,4,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,4,0,9,5,1,1,6,0,16,16,4,1,2,23,32,14,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,3,12,3,0,0,6,9,1,1,1,0,0,0,7,4,0,2,4,4,21,1,21,25,5,10,0,1,0,0,18,6,0,3,4,98,27,4,0.0,0.0,0.09881521038131212,0.4415536422465531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10821620763197502,0.0,0.0,0.11174299279932548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746366776741148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09466448580931576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12345438387973462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339784151651744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06530436084514221,0.10439467423627803,0.08721514020625304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31093188259841525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2348590403714529,0.0,0.08458978566190029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20064394135423874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15871260399473705,0.09713787525025668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3393624144811396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10048498360605224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10721978139671397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08961196550774995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06759187549945657,0.10266180615745424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750830504866822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09716175735023387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13723287285260824,0.07701283761709808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11115313666050232,0.0957234856432192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09632150417226948,0.16105212596636345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202666375066624,0.0,0.17159463832108224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114908714660715,0.0,0.0,0.3045398487803766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06488335693215833,0.0,0.0,0.0590455545572314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110141866340295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835501532634208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09761108314200984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06520815788062627
addiction,victimofculture95,2019/04/03,"I'm a cocaine addict and alcoholic looking for a discussion please. As a lot of addicts I've come into contact with, I am a highly intelligent individual. I am full of drive, ambition, and compassion for my fellow human. I have never sought communication through the internet, but I did utilize it in my teen years to connect when my social anxiety was at an all time high. I feel like since those days, which was in like 2012, the internet had made huge strides in who its reaching and reddit is the first platform that comes to mind when I consider a wide audience. I am a highly functioning individual who works full time and attends college part time in California(a state which is almost impossible to make a living in these days). I'm constantly making connections on a daily basis when it comes to our culture and how it interferes with our instinct to connect. We're so disconnected with technology, so I'm curious as to your opinion on this matter. In all honestly I'm really trying to ground myself in the midst of an anxiety attack and if anyone can relate, i feel like it's someone reading this.",10.32072463768116,8.193311314009662,10.766473429951693,58.83782608695653,59.04830917874396,14.030917874396136,43.28985507246377,12.650343791298138,5.6327739130434775,890,42,146,25,9,305,127,207,0.04,0.8190000000000001,0.141,0.9584,0,0,2,0,0,0,19.0,2,1,0,2,6,5,1,0,14,0,11,3,0,4,3,30,24,16,0,1,2,0,2,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,14,13,1,1,2,1,0,5,1,1,0,1,5,3,15,4,29,19,6,38,0,0,1,0,11,20,0,4,15,105,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2975001720151807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14582300905295906,0.13663445525515713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087669744358144,0.0,0.0,0.09540865679046298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15523099462193007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3526174635742212,0.0,0.14745342531650138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17599726715806885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13798592510399765,0.194959087420978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11606386743006256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4324991368532641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19998698707407206,0.0,0.1204874005177361,0.0,0.11458320684710402,0.0,0.0,0.11600447785889707,0.0,0.1291118076957848,0.182162189722705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13777508864022742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523825938575106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477615019626637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14978056622194907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364864162767897,0.0,0.08741303799182636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11287242907355652,0.0,0.0,0.13909307269362908,0.11561321101933045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386943866860861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09264024768158426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993368546312377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08786899860038834

addiction,Poghead1,2019/04/03,"Worried about myself I don’t really know what to do honestly. I’m 15, nearly 16, about to do my GCSEs and pretty sure I’m at the lowest stage I’ve ever been in my life. In the past couple of months especially I’ve been doing a lot of drugs- mainly ket and mdma but also coke sometimes- and I’ve been drinking a lot. I kept telling myself I was going to stop drugs till summer and then I’d just do it again. I should be revising now but I won’t force myself to do it and I don’t know why! I used to be such a hard worker and I feel like I’ve lost all direction in my life. 
I’ve also been struggling with disordered eating for about a year and every time I drink I binge eat but then I’ll do md and not eat for a couple days which doesn’t help. 
Nothing important matters to me anymore, only drugs and lads because they make me feel important.
I’m not sure why I’ve just gone into absolute self destruct mode, I’ve lost all my self worth.  
I just want to be happy with myself and do well in life but I don’t know how or what to do.",1.067266666666665,2.632148471111112,3.324611111111114,91.26425000000003,79.84444444444446,6.1000000000000005,19.25,6.961326702584282,0.15799999999999992,806,18,183,9,20,277,115,225,0.12,0.758,0.122,0.341,1,0,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,3,14,10,1,1,7,0,22,12,0,3,5,43,38,21,0,2,10,0,3,1,0,2,6,0,0,2,5,13,6,2,5,2,1,2,7,4,1,0,9,3,23,6,25,24,5,23,0,2,0,0,5,7,0,3,14,117,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17870282607068602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108073431583706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811031219718777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.247256930594733,0.0,0.07205739100092949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12805365342804448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21890811024405246,0.38871821459855255,0.34298678296527985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010672815680967,0.09413836837361103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11298931987294647,0.07982080300633658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06349942487660021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11893995702228298,0.10008922325221706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07489107886462376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18421366280263274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2367571863501888,0.05458622835604096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2439356417209164,0.18997976852514967,0.0,0.0,0.07458145425999968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918279060080157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10720911512058748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08497662453852994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10666008828384163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11367081472790612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07157787798487826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331200518367886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11050502954362533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341229953471444,0.0,0.11680572636859865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106106975141857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09765800750119384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651513705445542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964998967144592,0.0,0.0,0.06590196602883011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045978152708936,0.0,0.20164008744883524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134684733690424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07195123982603302
addiction,drawslikeapencil24,2019/04/04,Actually trying.... After 15 years of alcohol and drug abuse I finally have found the courage to step away. I made it to an Oxford House yesterday. I left my hometown where I was born and raised and the county I had lived in all 33 years of my life.  Took me losing everything to finally the monster I had become. This last year ive lost my wife my home my vehicles and my job. I continued this down ward spiral using anything I could for an excuse mostly the divorce I was going through. It's only been 24 hrs since leaving and I can honestly say I have not felt this good in years. Its a wonderful feeling knowing that I'm right where God wants me to be. So many things are falling into place. The darkness in my heart Is fading away. I am finding it difficult to cut ties with some people. Some of which I grew up with and was friends with long before drug use began. I know this is a must in recovery. If anyone has any tips on how to deal with this or some advice in what to say I'd appreciate it. There are a certain few I am very close with and I feel like I ran out and left em to rot away.  They don't this but I don't plan on ever coming back. I'm starting fresh and not ignoring God's signs a any more. ,2.2051138716356107,3.728864640316207,3.846911349520045,88.94026350461134,76.5098814229249,7.032486354225485,23.510069640504426,7.793537801064563,1.0342630905326562,946,29,206,14,21,316,158,253,0.05,0.843,0.106,0.8879,1,0,3,0,2,0,21.0,0,0,1,3,7,11,1,0,11,0,22,5,1,4,4,47,42,14,0,4,5,1,3,1,1,1,4,2,1,0,15,18,1,1,8,0,0,7,4,5,0,0,13,5,29,6,33,26,7,45,0,2,0,0,8,21,0,7,18,137,44,1,0.0,0.13417638617133812,0.11051043757578956,0.0,0.0,0.1106613562416703,0.0,0.12102408538173533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15402048355910686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791832887042689,0.0,0.09319069359069322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3191912146896371,0.08707814166651183,0.0,0.0,0.12506981298745307,0.09636285185160072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975502341179436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041663406187136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675025621981475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26265567031558706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10243626458818428,0.0,0.0,0.10177698467777974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11451979005041027,0.08090199686324075,0.10873261812739196,0.24810794601948194,0.1035035537356709,0.0,0.0,0.12416690785348568,0.08749253164701164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06435954135636147,0.09498423519162337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13419544932439714,0.0,0.0,0.11359361212539325,0.0,0.0,0.13066911556723762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123778360158304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244725903433268,0.0923095000628686,0.0,0.11990972759363995,0.24608127582104486,0.0,0.07998804165513981,0.05532561323501085,0.0,0.09999709608506352,0.10021794703541782,0.0,0.12669179065844965,0.12361990720496475,0.0,0.0,0.10715482103849627,0.0,0.11481229536426465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08612765535970844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850957786481724,0.0,0.11831655090850925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09671030788994056,0.0,0.18011337368381436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09367714040574296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08015514244728401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07523471002471825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12581896716930893,0.07688568023671331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19561402660097196,0.0,0.09343869188797564,0.06679462556299468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122808986578464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2917033534854269
addiction,saltysef,2019/04/04,"Celebrated One Year Yesterday I’ve been lurking for quite some time, but decided to make my first post because maybe it can help somebody. Yesterday I celebrated 1 eat clean and sober. I’m 31 and have been in and out of rehabs since I was 19. Graduated from pills and come to heroin and crack. I’ve had some time before (3 years) when I was in my early 20s, but this time has been the hardest. Losing custody of my kids, break up of a relationship, trying to regain trust of my parents and be an independent person again. I’ve had to start life over and it’s been tough.. but rewarding as all hell. I haven’t done everything that has been suggested but I did the most important clean: don’t pick up no matter what. I don’t have much else to say except that it is possible and no one is alone in this. There’s resources and help out there if you so desire to seek it out. There are people that care about you even if you don’t care about yourself at this moment. Get it now before it’s too late. People are fucking dying and there’s a solution for it. Anyway, thank you guys for being there for me even if you didn’t know you were because there’s a lot of good stuff in this sub. I’m here for anyone if they want to talk or ask questions. If not, thanks for letting me share my excitement of the past year and my hope that the next year will be even better.",3.540913978494622,4.543911290322583,4.484191756272402,87.75962096774197,72.29749103942652,7.730537634408603,23.62741935483871,8.07648339933343,1.0337840860215048,1066,27,232,15,20,346,153,279,0.08199999999999999,0.691,0.227,0.9938,1,1,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,6,1,5,18,15,2,0,8,0,31,5,0,3,1,42,46,24,1,8,12,1,0,0,0,1,3,1,2,3,17,15,1,0,3,0,0,1,8,4,0,3,13,1,21,11,35,28,6,33,1,1,0,1,20,11,2,12,19,161,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12777268637690886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862622089756006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11533300804337553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15040873382729802,0.0,0.2099552216112864,0.0,0.0,0.1091095207267498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515650644620617,0.0,0.0,0.1062711440608194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12803715225714046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262489329911257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262368993306813,0.1030586533769699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24445143396939825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11087576261161047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10493728686230963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11405230311655118,0.06445501315027387,0.0,0.0,0.10347574696080646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215433178108888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16538277367422596,0.0,0.0,0.12253287811064285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06780016829075905,0.0,0.13916517919085294,0.0,0.0,0.1261527744892927,0.0871389061721647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380179315624086,0.0,0.10488359073272152,0.0,0.0,0.08234951316746618,0.0,0.12394036268300004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069013215594966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312039290985047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16719554216358345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13698625505457124,0.0,0.11776930916301707,0.1710565378928481,0.10772072219313787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13907958484482896,0.11815303765259655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820109089131544,0.13121771525584955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13245173062522306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09810767987953002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10205179898623266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08732094563639768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14122755652193422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09915902525459393,0.0,0.2271625041069795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21581170680181064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375919621854516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07276600963469973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3177813911117184

addiction,jakeysnakey83,2019/04/04,"Will I Ever Feel Good? Hi guys, quick question. 

35, female if that matters.  

I've had addictive tendencies most of my life, though I've never had to go to rehab except for an eating disorder, which I did on an outpatient basis.  

Mostly, I just used whatever I could get my hands on to 'change the way I felt'.  Ever since I was pretty young, I just DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.  I can handle it for a certain period of time, but the time always seems to come again where I JUST WANT TO FEEL BETTER, dammit.  And will do whatever it takes.  

First it was the eating disorder, then alcohol, then weed, then painkillers, then cocaine, then xanax, then (now) adderall.  If I don't have the adderall, I've started taking pretty high doses of sudafed to get me by - it works 'well enough'.  

I really try to get through life without using anything, but I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD when I do that!  Honestly, I just don't feel good.  

For context, I'm smart, successful, well liked, have a great job...I""m sure people don't know this about me unless I tell them. 

I also take Lexapro for depression and anxiety...I also follow a very low carb diet, because it seems to be the thing that makes me feel the best that isn't a drug. 

Guys, I just want to feel good.  I want to feel as smart as Adderall makes me feel.  I want to feel as fun and sociable as Alcohol makes me feel.  I want to feel as relaxed and easygoing as Xanax makes me feel.  Without all this shit, I'm often an anxious mess who doesn't feel worthy of happiness.  IT.  SUCKS.  

I've had years of therapy.  YEARS.  I've read every self help book, I've had relationship coaches, I've tried treating codependency and love addiction, I've been to 12 step programs for the eating disorder, tried to convince myself I was an alcoholic so I could go to AA, I've tried yoga, tried activating my kundalini, getting my sleep in order, meditation, journaling, I've tried ""surrender"", I've traveled around the world, I've moved multiple times, I don't know what the eff to do anymore.  

Does anyone have any inspiration to share?

addiction,KonungariketSuomi,2019/04/04,"I have a porn addiction and need help with breaking it. I've had this addiction for about two or so years. It's gotten to a point where I use it as a form of depression relief because nobody else around me cares enough to help. I also worry about myself because I have found and caught myself watching things that could be considered (or are) illegal where I live (such as bestiality). I don't even enjoy it. I don't know why I do it, but my theory is because I can/could.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared, and it's tearing me apart. I've considered going as far as buying a cage and handing off the key just to prevent myself. Blockers don't work because I have a vivid imagination.

addiction,dyelife,2019/04/04,"Put my Brother in Detox yesterday, I have some questions Hey Everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I have zero clue if this is the best post to post on but I hope so. If not, simple direction would be appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story: My brother has a history as most do and was incredibly good at being a functional alcoholic. Crazy thing is, I only met him about 5 years ago. I was adopted at birth. I mention that because his history far exceed our new history. So, he has triggers that his mother my (bio mom) knows and manipulates. Well this time, she did a number on him and he went right to the binge. He lost his job, dignity, confidence and is broken. But, he is so loved that I plan to be there every step of the way. I have 3 incredible sisters as well that are there but have no clue what to do. So here I am to do my best in leading. But he is the real leader here and we all know that, just want to support the best way. 

&amp;#x200B;

His Wife, ooo, she is rough to deal with an is as well an addict / alcoholic. Common cliche story right? Its very hard to have sympathy for her in regards to the way she has treated family and even myself in the past 5 years. So she has no friends anymore, no local family and has torn up as much of a relationship as possible with us. She kept control of my brother and kept him sheltered and just obnoxious. ANYWAYS, sorry I digress, a side from all of that they do live in an expensive part of town here. They're bills are crazy high and since he lost his job...which was a great job...he was the bread winner. She did a gofundme page and its sad to see not many are offering up. Probably because of her lack of being a good friend and support to others when needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the actual question: Outside of potential disability and donations on gofundme...are there programs out there that can offer resources or something along those lines for the spouse? She is literally probably the next one to go into a break down and with all of this regardless of what shes done its hard to not feel some sympathy (cautious sympathy). If there is a place I can look or call for her or check into for any type of financial support or loans that help said situations? I have no idea I am totally shooting in the dark here and just trying to see what options. If there are none then it is what it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you Reddit community and hopefully I did this correctly.

addiction,dope_amemes,2019/04/04,"I dont recognize myself anymore, and i havent for a long time and its scaring me. I've been in and out of psych wards, struggling with addiction and living / environmental problems on and off for 8 years. I've been homeless and close to being on the streets. I just got kicked out of a group home for continuing to relapse and break curfew and other rules. I just feel so embarrassed. It's like I'm constantly conflicted about who I really am, and its usually in ""black or white"" thinking, as in, I'm all evil or all good. One or the other. Anyway back to my main point.... This is scaring me because I had a very troubled upbringing , and I'm 24 now, and that impending sense of doom, deep cynicism, helplessness etc etc just gets worse and worse. Oh and I've tried recovery. I've tried hard many times to go to NA. I went to a meeting a day on and off for like 2 years. I have no job, no direction, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing and I just want a purpose.

Does anyone have any honest advice for how to get back to me....",2.5220908837468627,3.96932768246446,4.182341789796489,87.18397825480905,75.49289099526067,7.808307778087538,25.207973236688037,8.4952907291091,1.5544176749372731,795,27,173,15,17,267,125,211,0.211,0.73,0.059,-0.9851,1,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,0,11,15,3,4,9,0,12,2,0,1,2,35,26,21,0,2,7,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,9,19,0,1,3,0,0,2,5,11,0,1,5,4,15,4,29,20,5,30,1,2,2,1,3,15,1,3,14,110,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16015663196214402,0.0,0.14356148321046105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09990573862229428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14569801623921064,0.102724842329254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2259337423183997,0.0,0.0895566763872357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15876053993519945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947465991419314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12856437714840616,0.0,0.1721807018799444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.327693202687708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07428352351241413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13581851188450206,0.15351174382897326,0.0,0.08349392714550019,0.12322348242272822,0.1174995830981913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13160500792740004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14736551216977134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14578828026634594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807394301661705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143548341811405,0.0,0.12972668977018156,0.13001320071743638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14894651550533525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09955191219231507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13888007792026594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14057570404488606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941160985522756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29417067437296235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1535851517797111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09413578711553004,0.0,0.0,0.17133206469972492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19948828872696264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16180368828106922,0.12121844203127387,0.08665297301588681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13618963305017542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.299433378935617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1892140468275957

The past few months have been different though, it’s never felt like this, never this good to me but I’m bored a lot so I’m not sure if it’s just something to pass the time. But I have been doing lines first thing in the morning, bumps at work and staying up late doing it. I think some of that is due to a moderation issue that I have with everything not just drugs.

addiction,throwawayhgjvbj,2019/04/05,"What are the next steps after quitting and how else can I stay sober without only isolating myself I think I’ve smoked weed and drank so much that I don’t feel comfortable in social situations without It. Also partly not knowing who I am without it or what I have to offer people. I have been avoiding all the people I used to smoke and drink because I usually break if I’m around it. But now I’m lonely and need advice how to not give into my addictions but also not isolate myself. 
After quitting smoking weed I began to replace I.T with drinking whenever I had alcohol available (I’m not 21). Only in the last few weeks it caught up to me, as I was sent to the hospital for cutting my head and fucking up my girlfriends event she was hosting. I had been drinking in the morning and drank to pregame and blacked out which is no excuse. I’m a college student so it’s easy to get and part of the culture so Ive been avoiding I.T completely. 

I’m sorry I’m rambling and I don’t make the most sense but I’m just feeling so lost.

addiction,Ania__kot,2019/04/05,"1 year off methadone after 5+ years. I am so fucking proud of myself. Thought I'd be on it forever. But I got pregnant. 

Please no judgement, but even though medical advice says to stay on throughout pregnancy, I decided to very slowly taper and jump during the 2nd trimester when it's considered safer. I didn't want my innocent child to have to suffer in the NICU for weeks, despite the clinic telling me she'd only have to say ""a few extra days,"" I knew that wasn't true. 

It's the hardest thing I've ever done. Typical drawn out withdrawal. No sleep for months it seemed, exhaustion, body aches, restless legs. Intense cravings. 

I did get some fentanyl during labor/delivery. I had a perfectly healthy baby girl that was able to come home with us, and didn't have to go through withdrawal. I got another 3 shots of fentanyl again a couple months ago for issues with an ectopic pregnancy. Fuck, it was so good. Like shooting up heroin again.

I still get cravings. I still have back pain everyday, which is getting better with physical therapy. For awhile I always thought about how easy it would be to go back to the clinic. But I haven't and I won't. I've come so far. Life is so much simpler not having to worry about taking my dose or getting to the clinic. 

Anyway, yeah. 1 year.

addiction,massiveotter411,2019/04/05,"7 months sober- absolutely miserable- advice needed! Hi, 

I’m 7 months sober- lost everything about a year ago- relationship, stepson, home and job. Relocated after rehab and am lucky enough to have a steady job, living in a safe place even though it’s sober living and going to meetings/have a sponsor/involved in the program. I don’t know what more to do to get myself happy and stop missing my life I had before. I just want it back and it’s gone because I walked away from everything for my addiction. Anyone have any advice? 

Thank you! And sorry to be a bummer.

addiction,leumasci,2019/04/05,"Am I going to overwhelm myself? I smoke cigs, drink everyday (though not getting drunk) and smoke weed (although farrrrr less than I used to).  I’m sick of it.  I love smoking cigs, and I love drinking.  I barback at a local bar I live a block away from, and I’m pretty much there every night, working or not.  I’ve had a couple coworkers quit smoking and drinking successfully.  I know that working there probably isn’t the best for my health considering I’m clearly addicted to these things, and it definitely doesn’t make it easier to quit.  I’m spending way too much money, and I just feel like a weak person, mentally.  I also just got dumped by someone who also has a drinking problem, and I think the reason may be that I was not a good influence on her well being, and I feel pretty terrible about it.  I need a plan of action.  I feel pretty fuckin stupid I’ve never asked for help before, so I guess I’m a step closer haha.",1.9705291762013708,4.311878907608698,3.834668192219681,84.81856979405038,80.57608695652175,6.264988558352402,23.814645308924483,7.475848149327749,1.2812108695652171,725,26,138,11,19,244,114,184,0.139,0.6509999999999999,0.21,0.9417,0,0,6,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,7,11,15,3,1,10,1,9,13,0,4,2,30,29,14,0,2,6,0,3,1,0,1,4,0,0,1,9,8,6,1,6,6,2,3,6,7,1,0,3,3,19,8,15,23,4,12,0,1,0,3,7,5,1,3,4,90,28,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332178783509555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1954492926374302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11424208293731608,0.0,0.11481250918555833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10398463652061507,0.0,0.12824313306603224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13521384425483926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4788445291052403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029601932617801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18536653669945188,0.08730091083824937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06384533866722752,0.0,0.06945003583830288,0.1024969786780496,0.09773585380568392,0.0,0.13461893726471436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12989468070022245,0.0,0.0,0.08190921604762355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715885226997488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970157246261664,0.0,0.10790632997802484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22058359028360228,0.0,0.08157057613191797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12315056008530716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17966460383066804,0.09061100377352001,0.09424947583560993,0.0,0.0,0.1146780066938129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670180105098613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3729691491834897,0.13175408894601076,0.11693051240599307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2599530761127134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12564368866614253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10354109429254782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118537201142667,0.07830190784351858,0.12006253871502764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554302339329376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09699801248511468,0.0,0.0,0.1098739939916442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17792856960574133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Dr-Crews,2019/04/05,"Struggling I have 103 days clean. I am doing my step work, completing service and being responsible in other areas of my life (college, work, family). Lately I’ve been thinking way too much about using coke again. It has gotten to a point where I want to start smoking weed again just to force me to chill down, as coke is my worst enemy. I don’t know what the fuck to do and I haven’t been able to sleep until it is 4-5 am. I’m going crazy and I don’t want to lose the little clean time I have over a stupid plant, but everyday that I think more about coke is bringing me a step closer to smoking. Idk i just need a little insight or something because asking reddit at 3 in the morning is kind of desperate.",3.742191780821919,4.4838854109589095,4.9752328767123295,85.39682191780824,71.60273972602741,7.4838356164383555,24.87397260273973,7.554174236665415,1.1181747945205474,554,15,115,6,10,184,94,146,0.141,0.804,0.055,-0.9009,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,3,8,6,2,1,7,0,17,6,1,1,0,15,31,7,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,5,3,3,0,4,0,0,4,3,5,0,0,3,0,14,1,19,27,3,24,0,1,0,1,1,11,1,1,8,76,19,4,0.19500772495855853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182305898728398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11887489913847316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20446188944182064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576385001169751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18383592784785396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18028149941157107,0.0,0.0,0.11082738404873403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2030705369471232,0.10717114574463238,0.0,0.21997720769188092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13773972320180444,0.0,0.3908979415520051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2181637631843995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14335311572095275,0.14459575712286032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18434533215290186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19514855720534405,0.0,0.0,0.1501264738885464,0.0,0.0,0.13802747142491978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20386441484313986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2499061521732477,0.0,0.0,0.11371057263391825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16842406265285126,0.0,0.0,0.230041217312985,0.15478805520965436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28393589260125096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,DeadlyDragon115,2019/04/06,"Is negative reinforcement bad for an addict? This post is probably going to look like a shit post but basically a friend of mine who is 18 is addicted to weed and I know its not physically addictive but he is mentally addicted and his life is kinda in shambles right now he got his GED over like 9 months ago and got an apartment which was a horrible idea because it brought him closer to our local plugs and the problem is his parents disapprove of any drug whether its weed or heroin and when they caught him in december they threatened to take him out of the apartment and leave him on the street and that led to an emotional roller coaster where I almost watched him kill himself but he didn't and he wasn't 18 yet so legally they couldn't kick him out yet but over the months he was doing really good or so I thought until I fucked up and revealed that I had weed and personally I only use it every few months when there is a party and I want to have a good time but with him he will wake and bake until he can't get anymore and then he gets really irritable and because I revealed that I had weed he would just throw insults which didn't hurt me but it got old after a while and my main way to get him to stop would be reminding him about how good he is doing and how he doesn't want to fuck it up but recently its gotten really bad and so I turned to negative reinforcement saying things along the line of ""do you want to be the homeless 18 year old who has to take full responsibility?"" and I don't think it helped and fast foward to thursday his parents decided to get him a phone and the same day he contacted one of his plugs and on friday got caught and now he is homeless just going to random parties getting high and I can't help but feel this is my fault.",4.8111674273360565,5.2540086298342565,5.607929377852511,82.8896168628393,69.05524861878453,9.058083113139565,28.72255584914725,9.085049710711278,2.1030466970934416,1412,47,296,25,23,462,177,362,0.158,0.732,0.11,-0.9773,2,0,1,0,0,0,5.0,1,1,3,0,16,16,5,0,17,0,33,11,2,4,0,65,62,45,1,7,14,2,1,2,1,3,6,1,1,1,18,27,1,1,8,1,0,7,11,10,0,1,16,4,37,6,37,40,4,53,0,1,2,2,46,19,3,5,26,201,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4102534199224806,0.0,0.0,0.0833980879371261,0.0,0.094209613675136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06397904107612233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09330414342783158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1571092151175209,0.1147031262915129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06067515882387781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10910534450794994,0.0,0.0,0.10582967766595963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07926821070188188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757072684330555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0726875821546155,0.17395473514505938,0.2457700203096578,0.0,0.10693802914854122,0.2367347567472153,0.3009841379337493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261224710326798,0.09940288370573812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10071681322250256,0.10620721738033438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408788285526398,0.0,0.051705051084136686,0.0,0.0,0.09961933906272978,0.0,0.0,0.06645295592373418,0.09192750470403584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07900525259580474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09481260898643457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22528625761611906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1974466347337047,0.0,0.06375245273385463,0.07155366185997254,0.0,0.0,0.20893403346866204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214884393694677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802092532093636,0.0,0.10143639548978736,0.09002384515062846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18081416998372646,0.0,0.09289470452719466,0.0,0.0,0.08034558284710826,0.0,0.07481784673694708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657390382476856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865683216728364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147603202768044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06250395391304425,0.06028399843343549,0.0,0.07469066299152152,0.054860017834022716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233428743300896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125671049569486,0.0,0.0,0.16647614630760724,0.0746779764853843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13366642154017935,0.0,0.0,0.06058577535735595
addiction,truthalizer,2019/04/06,"my partner keeps drinks at home and this is making it difficult for me I know one of the first things to do when you decide to stop drinking is to get rid of all the alcohol in the house, but my wife doesn't want to do it, she likes to drink and she can keep that under control much better than me. Sometimes i proposed her to do a alcohol diet together but she is not interested. This makes my attempts to stop drinking much more difficult because she drinks in front of me and we always have nice drinks in the fridge etc. I don't want to blame her because if i arrived to this situation of alcohol addiction is only my fault, she is drinking responsably. Plus I always thought I should be able to stop even in this situation as alcohol in life is everywhere anyways, and will always be everywhere around me as soon as I go out of my house, so I might as well have it at home and try to fight it,  but I just wanted to check if someone is experiencing similar situations.

addiction,Lalunaxvii,2019/04/06,"So give me some insight i beg Okay, so I have written posts before, and the info has been real useful. But, I'll be honest I wasn't in the mind set to take it.

So I am pretty addicted to coke, I'll do it whenever I can, anytime going for drinks with mates, I'll do it. And the thing is, I do it alone. It's go to the stage that when I do it with friends I'm lying saying I haven't done it months, when reality, I may have done it few hours ago. I'm also in so much debt, so much, that I'm missing payments. I'm self harming and I'm fed up. I'm trying to avoid the mates that do the coke but when I do it alone, this no longer helps. 

Sorry for long info, but I wanna change. As of Monday I'm changing my eating etc no more alcohol coz that's a trigger. But I'm fucked, I'm poor, addicted and cut to shreds...
Don't know what to do

addiction,superbakedbro,2019/04/06,Need Assistance/Advice On Kicking a Nicotine Addiction (JUUL) I go my entire life never touching a cigarette or a vape right up until college. It was there I discovered the Juul. Ever since I bought my first pack of pods I was (&amp; still am) absolutely hooked. As we don’t know the long term effects of the usage &amp; the price itself for the pods alone I need to bury this hatchet as soon as I can. I’ve tried to quit numerous times to no avail. I’m reaching out to you guys today &amp; maybe even Ex-Juulers who have found a good method to ease the process of kicking this terrible addiction. I no longer reach for my alarm clock first thing in the morning.. I reach for my Juul. It has finally come to my attention (&amp; my bank accounts’  attention) that the device itself is nothing more than shoveling money into a fireplace. Does anyone have any tips on how they kicked their nicotine addiction? I’ve decided to try Cold Turkey for the 5th time (fingers crossed) any advice would be helpful! I thank you for your time.,4.496037414965984,6.1442498622449015,5.0988571428571445,81.77947619047622,70.78571428571428,8.083809523809524,29.393197278911572,8.648137234880735,2.340256870748299,807,32,148,14,15,259,128,196,0.065,0.857,0.078,0.1449,0,1,2,0,0,0,31.0,1,3,2,4,6,4,0,1,14,0,11,5,1,2,2,17,20,6,0,3,1,0,2,0,0,1,4,0,0,1,9,4,0,0,6,0,5,3,4,2,0,2,4,3,21,2,26,14,2,25,0,0,0,0,9,7,0,1,15,94,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40781279321295694,0.0,0.2437039655016872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291479740044198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5404344498143118,0.0,0.169595800587647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871906965271259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10741499877447194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912275295800927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236086635525885,0.11279512893734152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13659892750947922,0.0,0.2121335690761075,0.0,0.1367232828860923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086789814938557,0.1045895132795552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12346914597110935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08358143966799217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685299387545214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08807683009731332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11035248408501136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12527440090494316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.184921758761538,0.0961736329366623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11964966085624068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13263008362203768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10649013503050073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10315023857055028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09958279098992848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480378947596814,0.0,0.0,0.08284281794067336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21813460677873547,0.0,0.11819770757090635,0.0,0.0,0.16932148493699792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885808203416987,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,griegoenbcn,2019/04/06,"I was battling the wrong addiction for the last 3 years For the last few years I have a serious pattern that starts from wanting to go out to a bar, drinking until start to get drunk, then doing coke or meth to wake up and dive into a 1-2 day binge and sex parties until passed out.

I thought my gateway drug was alcohol. I recently realized that I am a sex/love addict. Seeking any kind of erotic intimacy is what makes me start drinking and so on. 

So... where do I start? How do I deal with this? I know many ways to deal with drugs and worked on me sometimes until the loneliness took over and blew everything into pieces.

I have no idea how to deal with my sex addiction. Should I impassively stay alone? Be celibate? I’m really lost. I already feel that if I’m not seeking for “love” I don’t have any desire to go out and drink and none of the rest rollercoaster will follow.

But I don’t want to be alone. And I love sex. 

What do I do?

addiction,TeddyHoesavelt,2019/04/06,"I went to rehab a year ago and I’m starting to relapse again So April 11, 2018 I admitted myself into rehab. I had lost my girlfriend and my a good home with our dog and her mother. I spent 2 months in rehab and then went to IOP where I tried everything to convince her that it wasn’t helping me anymore and what I really needed was her and to come back home. I made it 6 months sober, linked up with an old using friend and relapsed that night. I’ve relapsed once every two months since then and she had stuck by my side. I needed up relapsing again a week ago. This time she left me and moved out of state with our dog. I’m completely heartbroken and scared. She was my only accountability and now that she’s gone my home is empty and so am I. She says that I chose cocaine over her. That I don’t really love her because if I did I would stop using. I hate this drug and everything that comes with it. It’s slowly taking everything from me again. I’m going back to IOP. It’s a 6 month program. Hopefully this time I’ll get it right and this time I’ll earn my family back for good. I hate this damn drug.

addiction,Blowlara,2019/04/06,"My brothers shopping addiction ruins my family - looking for advice Hey guys, I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but I am very desperate rn

I moved out a few years ago, but my brother (21) is a compulsive shopper. He has a job, he goes to work, but he spends WAY more than he earns (I don't have exact numbers). For example, he has to pay for his car (leasing car about 28k), insurance, his phone etc
He is in debt, he would be even more in debt if my parents wouldn't pay most of his bills. He HAS to have the newest, best car, the newest best phone etc. 
He buys shoes for 500 eur, designer pants for 300 and shirts for 120 each every two weeks or so. He gets expensive watches, expensive wallets etc. 
Nothing wrong with getting expensive stuff, but he doesn't have the money for it. He pays it all with his card and is also in debt there. He lives at home, my parents work every day and I'm sure that at least 40% of their earnings go into his pocket. 
My mum cooks every single day. What is he doing? Eating out every day. I often feel like he buys these things to be cool and accepted. He acts like he is kanye west or some of these super rich kids on Instagram. But it's all just flexing. You should see his room, he lives like a pig and doesn't care.
My mum doesn't charge him for rent, she buys him cigarettes etc.

I know that they should've intervened WAY earlier. I would've thrown him out years ago. But my parents dont listen. They cry about how they dont have enough money and let me (I'm studying for my masters degree and working at a bar to help them) pay for some of their bills sometimes. 
I am SO fed up with this. My brother doesn't give a single fuck about my parents finances. Were arguing every day when I visit them.

I know this post is confusing and I may have made a lot of mistakes, but i am on the verge of a breakdown because i just dont know what to do.",2.3620838688946013,3.8789622030848365,3.5596778598971714,91.1930643476864,76.06940874035989,6.713399742930591,23.210234575835475,7.413659706084162,0.7882190874035988,1463,43,321,18,32,475,192,389,0.079,0.79,0.13,0.9803,10,0,1,0,0,0,53.0,0,1,7,9,13,17,2,1,13,1,37,8,2,2,4,52,55,24,0,6,13,9,1,3,0,4,1,1,3,2,14,16,4,0,6,3,22,7,10,6,0,1,3,6,43,11,42,45,20,39,0,1,3,1,55,17,1,11,15,199,57,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347358277469288,0.0,0.08378801439395027,0.15201371050147636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685694212359034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0522687278119544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17996601150415698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874216911928942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09418572400154301,0.22119106699514826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3014738801422329,0.0,0.0,0.08773748655469288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08859644104961639,0.3825087644622023,0.05663308302322119,0.0,0.3612149610279524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083178319709476,0.0,0.04335472717404998,0.06125550876923014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07926891791763213,0.08959536996929797,0.08225342838587844,0.048730273698961296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490001021148287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057472375187266514,0.0,0.08600819230009821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08508765897548028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18849057241920394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767901789632608,0.0,0.12567051685049668,0.0,0.1514269915114871,0.0,0.07200333900489984,0.0,0.0,0.07289645642843752,0.0,0.08113301691285303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09113226970242892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822736510291586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3808341229784008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08211902072535532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07322488124788046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06832684218823104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08480297806220033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09815633073366978,0.0,0.0,0.08081267628596599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05696448318154663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375939887748343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07074775447143405,0.0,0.13611914348496348,0.06877864014099104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872678924732216,0.0,0.0,0.12182011129017575,0.09374757006808213,0.0,0.11043260994933024

I’m really trying to quit smoking nicotine but I’m kinda afraid to. I’ve tried before and failed but I didn’t give it my all. I know I’m ready to quit I just don’t know how. Any advice at all from anyone with experience would be helpful.

addiction,Nikro2,2019/04/06,"I really need some help I'm only a 17-year-old boy, but I struggle with so many things. I'm involved with AP classes like AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics, AP US History, etc. I even made it all the way to being the math sterling scholar. As cool as that may sound, I can't help and think that I don't deserve it. I have so much going on with me, that there's no way I could be as cool as I may seem. I want to become as good of a person as I can, because as much as I want other people to respect me, I can't respect myself. I don't even have low self-esteem issues, I just can't live with myself like this anymore. So I came to you guys so I could hold myself accountable. In my life, I have stolen, ignored my family, ignored my friends, I don't know what to do anymore. I need help! I've noticed that the reason I do all these things is simply because I am bored. When I'm bored I steal, I eat, I play video games, when I should be studying, or working at all...",2.6647252747252783,3.013371076923079,4.443708791208792,89.66557692307694,73.80769230769229,7.096703296703296,25.91483516483517,6.868970318607317,0.9131527472527472,736,23,171,6,14,251,112,208,0.117,0.6659999999999999,0.21600000000000005,0.9663,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,1,1,0,1,10,16,0,1,5,2,22,2,0,2,3,30,35,17,0,7,3,0,0,2,1,3,1,1,0,3,12,6,1,3,4,3,1,2,7,7,0,0,2,3,35,9,21,25,7,10,0,1,0,0,11,4,0,5,4,116,47,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2829059668058561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1738947363267639,0.1575262452992441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16313343222688947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22776068079339315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459485215068871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15907279439183605,0.1884146688078066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13446110336232572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11019741433099986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08106126216136672,0.11963326381448887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14122846975518671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868104107646789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488711359892788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07838701974161524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10074546023377964,0.13936594152681325,0.0,0.1259469948091155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13496219607844245,0.0,0.14460683494213578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2097024051383379,0.21152018837516506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16238789725599742,0.14966867772358594,0.0,0.0,0.1084783437439317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888332544571718,0.12454108286166934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913739477729454,0.14664983052852815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12984715167135846,0.14879666763703986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14911032069210114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18951721607771488,0.09139306269354032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1715691778231729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682565332077855,0.22642987074892035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10383806324008688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09185056913047283

I can enjoy times with my friends and s/o without thinking about drugs and when im in a good mood, but other than that it seems like literally everything would be better if I experienced it on drugs.

addiction,sole_throwaway,2019/04/07,"Just Looking To Vent I've known that I've had a problem for awhile. I can't enjoy things in moderation. I know that I keep coming back to Reddit looking for answers, and I know that no one here can really do anything to fix my situation; I'm the only one that can do that. 

I have problems with alcohol, drugs, and self harm. Last night, I got black-out drunk in secret, and then got high on top of that. My fiancé was left to clean up the mess and take care of my pathetically wasted ass. I knew it was wrong but I did it anyway. 

I haven't done hard drugs in quite some time, but I feel myself going down that path again. If I had the opportunity to go back to some of that stuff, I know that I would. 

I know that none of you can help me fix this. I think I'm just looking for a place to catalogue this all for myself, and Reddit has become that place.

I hope everyone is having a good night. I know you guys are all trying to overcome obstacles. I hope you find peace.

addiction,anonaccount___,2019/04/07,"How to help a friend with a cocaine addiction? Figured I’d post this here since I don’t really have anywhere else I can ask about this. I’ve been friends with this girl since high school, and I’d really like to help her out if I can. She is in college and does coke and other drugs on a regular basis and I’ve recently heard rumors that she has a “sugar daddy” 44M that gives her coke. She’s convinced that it’s not a problem, and so far I haven’t had much luck changing her mind. I know this is pretty vague but I didn’t really want to put out anything more personal. I’d appreciate any tips or suggestions you can offer. Thanks.

addiction,helpfulperson1,2019/04/07,"My brother died of an overdose Friday. But this is for you. I found out he had relapsed that night. I face timed from 130 am to 5 am. In the course of that time, he told me and my mom what he had been doing and we called an ambulance and had it sent to his house (we live 6 hours away from him). He refused treatment from the paramedics and sent it away. He said he  didn't need it. My mom booked the earliest flight which was 6am. At 5am he hung up on me, right after I dropped her off at the airport. I didn't call him back. He said he just wanted to sleep, and I thought he would just go to bed and be okay. When my mom got there she found him, alone.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are reading this, and you are in a dark place-  Take the scariest leap of your life by getting help. Do more than you think you need to do. My brother refused because it wasn't on his terms. He always thought he knew best. I love him unconditionally and have the utmost respect for him. But he was so isolated. This wretched disease took him. Please, trust your loved ones if you have them. And if you don't, trust me. I am rooting for you. Addiction is a family's common enemy, and I hate that it fell on my brother's shoulders to bear the pain of it, like you have to. I would have taken his addiction from him if I could. Every day. If you have ever trusted someone at any point in your life, listen to them. Quit your job, leave your house, get away from it. Go into that rehab you have been refusing. Go into that sober house. You will save yourself. You are strong enough to start over. It will be hard, but being alive will be beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

I am begging you.

addiction,nabiloh173,2019/04/07,"I'm making the decision to stop hurting my body and start loving myself. Since a young age I have had an addictive personality. It started with TV then video games, eventually as I grew older I started to smoke. A few years down the road a colleague introduced me to hash. I've suffered from insomnia and depression throughout my teenage years and hash became the immediate remedy to falling asleep. I ignored my inner voice that yelled at me to stop, I ignored the warning signs of me constantly looking forward to the night time when I'm alone with my joints. This kept going for 3 years and it changed me in a lot of ways that I could see but just chose to ignore. I was always late because I'd always get high and lose sense of time and be up way past my bedtime and then wake up early the next day with a nasty brain fog and mind boggling lethargy.

These changes eventually led to me pushing away my girlfriend back at the time, I wasn't the same patient and loving person she once knew. I moved away to another continent and we eventually broke up. (It was my fault.) I had wished for a new beginning and I was clean for 2 weeks until my new roommates offered me a joint and obviously I didn't think much of it until I became hooked. This made my new life worse than the old. I was alone and away from family and started dating one of my roommates who was a stoner, and later on I found out to be abusive and a cheater.

We eventually broke up and it hurt like hell. I wasn't familiar with narcissists nor the damage they inflict on those they are with. It took me a year and a visit from a really good friend to get me out of that rut. My friend was very social and we went out a lot. I met a lot of people through him before he moved back to England. The people I met through him were mostly ravers. 

I was introduced to a whole new type of drugs that I never thought I would ever look at when I was younger. I was terribly lonely for years, and I thought that I had found a group of amazing friends. They were amazing and truly added so much joy to my life. Unfortunately, that came with drugs and bender weekends for a whole year. I always kept my hard drug use to weekends until I eventually went through a rough patch with my family and at work. That's where the spiralling started. I started micro dosing during the week and at work. I eventually met the most amazing human being I've ever met in my life, I loved her to the core and when we started dating I still thought that what me and my friends did was normal. She said she was okay with it but it eventually caused us problems. It definitely was not the main reason why we broke up, but it did not help motivate her to stay.

It's been 2 months since our break up. The benders no longer do it for me. I'm feeling hollow, empty, and a complete failure and waste of human potential. I have gone from someone who only smoked cigarettes to someone who experimented with more than 15 hard drugs in the span of less than 2 years. I look back at all of it and I finally see the damage I have caused to others around me and myself. Whenever I use now, I feel disgust, shame, loneliness, and hate towards myself. 

I'm writing this here today because today I make the decision to stop. To quit it all, before everything else quits me. I've lost a lot but I've still got so much more to lose. I have been smoking much less in the past few weeks preparing for a day to start changing. I'm writing this here  because I want to make a statement and make it official. No more smoking, drinking, weed, or any kind of brain altering substance or chemical. I hope posting in this community of like minded people who want to change and regain control over their lives, would give me extra motivation to keep my word. I'm the hero of my own life, and today for the first time in my life, I will change. I will keep my word. I will be better.

Thank you to whoever read this far. It means the world knowing I'm not alone in this.

Today I had an OK day. Not great, but really the first day in four months where my anxiety/depression wasn't too bad. I've gotten some chores done, and called a couple friends; routine stuff for most people but for me it's a big win.

Four months sober now from mostly coke + benzos (xanax etc), and quite proud of this! But man, healing the brain takes TIME. So if you're struggling, PLEASE keep going, it WILL get better.

I always had a good reason why, I thought, thinking she was just over reacting all the time. Then she wrote this article to help me with a card game project and I realized to some extent she is probably right and I need to do a better job making sure I spend more quality time, off my phone, with her and our son.

addiction,35mmjb,2019/04/07,"I’ve been dealing with Xanax addiction for over 4 years and I really don’t think I’m strong enough to get sober  I’m sitting here in tears as I can’t make it longer than a week.  My longest is two months, this was before getting into a car accident that resulted in me developing ptsd.   This was a year and half a go, since then I’ve more or less been taking unprescribed Xanax multiple times a day.  I first turned to Xanax because for god knows what reason it was the only medication that helped mitigate the chronic pain I had developed from poor lifting form.  (I’ve tried millions of nerve damage meds, as well as muscle relaxers to no avail.  If it weren’t for my mom and how it would crush her (I’m her only child) I’d want to just end it.  I’m so humiliated by who I’ve become.  I’m a smart, well educated, young 25 year old who has resulted to becoming a hermit, taking drugs to feel numb and pushing away all of my friends.  I feel terrible about pushing them away but I don’t want them to see me like this and I don’t want this to be the way they remember me.   Rehab probably is A good idea but I couldn’t afford it myself and that’s not something I could tell my parents I need.  I guess after all this rambling I’m not sure what my point is but I hope i can find my way and I hope that others here too.

addiction,olivia_benson_6735,2019/04/07,"boyfriend recovering meth/heroin addict still using party drugs often My boyfriend has been using heroin and meth for over 6 years (with about 4-5 attempts to quit and relapses along the way). he has about 100 days without using heroin or meth right now. he currently uses party drugs like Ketamine, GHB and DMT or coke fairly often (like2-3 times a week). he says that this isn't a problem because those aren't the drugs he was addicted to, and he won't develop a problematic addiction to those drugs. but i sometimes feel like he still relies drugs as a way to deal with challenging emotions or frustrations in life. when he uses the party drugs, he will be out of commission for like almost a whole day, which isn't my favorite thing, but he is still nice to me and mostly considerate. it doesn't seem like an addiction the way opiates or meth was for him--he can do them for like 1 night and then not do them for a few nights. but it seems like it still could be problematic? i would love to hear thoughts from other former addicts or partners of addicts about this?",9.471774541531822,7.1966119271844695,8.688122977346277,73.54064185544769,60.79611650485437,11.67982740021575,36.48112189859763,9.994966539143718,3.3803717367853285,851,28,161,13,9,268,118,206,0.051,0.74,0.21,0.9871,1,0,10,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,2,3,11,11,1,0,11,0,19,15,0,5,0,37,30,17,0,3,10,0,1,6,1,3,13,2,0,1,11,10,1,0,5,0,0,0,7,2,0,0,4,3,7,9,25,20,3,23,0,0,0,1,16,4,0,11,22,100,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5170346789283989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07915373765431194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048186065160587835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0631122668664765,0.0,0.0,0.10195701725813283,0.08149355927397542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5500136649946702,0.0,0.0,0.0889167699052203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03996832898141599,0.05647089685477302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08909124738777642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05583294139894174,0.2317090148246468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07134263007771045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14835973245493206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07563690735700238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08407577428052622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750535256723215,0.0,0.06286101790946844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14392208628087916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0781790948005913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25250682285185205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05251503936159376,0.0,0.0,0.06275415971924146,0.046092699990459216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3413543530391364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882305020269616,0.06340640329746904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825269038723822,0.0,0.07619808814984554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05615242675904515,0.0,0.0,0.050903409759814056

addiction,throwaway-2718,2019/04/08,"Odd smell in my house One of my friends who is addicted to meth is staying with me and as far as I know he’s been clean and sober for the past 6 months or so but recently as in the past week or two I’ve been smelling this illusive odd smell that almost smells like a campfire and it’s to the point where I do a double take at my fireplace thinking someone lit a fire every time I smell it. Well just a few mins ago I got that same campfire smell mixed with a rotten eggs and incense or potpourri smell in my living room and then a minute or two later the smell went away and I also had my girlfriend walk to where I smelled this and she smelled the same thing. We also do not have incense or potpourri that I know of. Behaviorally, my friend hasn’t been acting much different than he normally does but I have noticed that he’s been going into the bathroom for longer periods of time than normal, other than that it’s about it.

This could be absolutely nothing so I don’t want to jump to any conclusions yet but I am wondering if what we’re smelling might be him smoking meth or something else in his room? I’ve never done drugs myself so I have no clue what it smells like. I looked to see if there was anything else in the house that might be giving off those smells but I have no explanation.",4.179152046783628,4.942788627819553,4.634987468671678,88.15284878863828,70.61654135338347,7.8659983291562225,27.18379281537177,7.984000788550335,1.4214835421888048,1029,33,222,13,18,326,144,266,0.077,0.848,0.075,-0.1561,1,0,4,0,0,0,9.0,1,0,0,1,12,6,0,0,13,0,24,3,0,0,1,40,36,28,0,6,14,0,1,2,3,2,2,0,3,0,20,11,1,0,5,0,0,5,6,1,1,3,9,18,25,5,29,21,5,35,0,0,3,0,12,15,0,12,16,154,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13957435234101506,0.0,0.0,0.11349310981980724,0.0,0.12820608116309146,0.0,0.0,0.2047751305835384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706650853305563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105359860340936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12029077334503435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10222355441517668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13376673999759472,0.0,0.0,0.11204212685276906,0.1310217266896538,0.0,0.0,0.14847708325764014,0.0,0.21390949445426627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10787292568614633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19783522495694086,0.0,0.0,0.12282046599689425,0.07276383539643637,0.0,0.10239930754254224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2954646915174949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407266565956449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251004506806144,0.0,0.11305506668182615,0.0,0.10751507655615763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2716445558910309,0.0,0.0,0.10219434125714268,0.0,0.09411863868679714,0.0,0.09874657749449928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.250889384442572,0.12285066236098628,0.14576588016588066,0.0,0.0,0.08675815355455463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2444430677076819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12103212143829685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12641667409127846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020253472996336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108481544335139,0.09856569410562004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13646563812136653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626452618370074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08505912163086163,0.08203807333977532,0.0,0.0,0.14931359178036044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2501383493339817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07551690141669952,0.0,0.10269997006227524,0.0,0.11511661753164625,0.11868743489206095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13884581363187812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,SatOhShe_KnockAMoto,2019/04/08,"Using Operant Conditioning on Myself to Help me Quit? Hello, I have a sort of behavioral addiction. I play video games 6 hours a day. I haven't been diagnosed, but I know I am addicted. There's a simple way to tell: a normal person plays video games in addition to a meaningful life, but I only work and eat and sleep so that I can play video games for every second of free time that I have.


I tried going cold turkey, but I can't stay off of video games. Instead of going cold-turkey, I've been thinking it might be wiser to somehow remove the pleasure from gaming. Should I force myself to do something unpleasant every time I play video games so that I eventually associate video games with displeasure? Or is there some sort of drug that makes me immune to feeling pleasure, so that instead of feeling good when I play video games, I just feel nothing?


Thanks in advance.",5.663149350649348,6.5513181071428574,6.099696969696971,78.53318181818184,67.33333333333333,8.966233766233767,28.963203463203463,9.095868883498916,2.383897619047619,694,23,126,12,11,224,98,168,0.041,0.7,0.259,0.9892,0,0,2,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,3,10,10,0,0,6,0,13,8,1,2,0,24,23,10,0,2,5,0,3,0,0,2,6,0,0,1,6,4,1,0,6,20,1,4,2,0,0,1,2,4,19,11,19,18,1,15,0,0,0,0,12,4,0,6,5,81,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3833301932928473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11338660072316335,0.0,0.0,0.17844926465759106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038904285425232,0.17990338383148333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29626467012581725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666931466804767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19984026161981636,0.14746589247233646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784557751807162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1731430782796857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662372701265363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12418384930923627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11735836474321375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18651270518211674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1722620857994718,0.16869993433296662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13371578492521569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1535155135627338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18700167002142085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17594270162280856,0.0,0.0,0.13535153822973564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873961747323224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153670697067213,0.1618675022325514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11265562040321822,0.0,0.0,0.20503913161127196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193673395545696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1518483406989818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395543426122817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279959451080679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,TwilightFlutterby,2019/04/08,"How do I know if he's still using? My other half and I have been in a serious relationship for 7 years. We have 3 kids (one mine but only knows S/O as his dad, the other 2 biologically ours). I accidentally stumbled upon some info last week that led me to believe S/O had bought some coke. After some investigating, talking to him, and talking to his friends, it was comfirmed. He tried to play it off as a one or two time thing, but I quickly found out he's been using regularly for about a year. He admitted an 8 ball lasts him anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks. He claims he doesn't typically use every day, mostly on weekends. I was irate when I found out, mostly because he's kept it a secret for so long. I feel very betrayed and I'm having a hard time trusting him with anything now.

I don't want to split up. Neither does he. We have a mostly great life together. The normal ups and downs, sure, but we love each other and our little family. He's blossomed into a great daddy, he holds down an excellent job (as do I) and he's a good man. That said, I am not ok with our children being raised by an addict and this is not the lifestyle I want around me or my family. Occasional, recreational usage might even be one thing, but the fact he's been hiding this combined with his dwindling bank account shows me this is a bigger issue.

He swears he's not addicted, he just enjoys it ""maybe a little too much"". Originally when confronted he was angry and defensive. Within a few days he came around, apologized for hiding it, said he doesn't want to lose his family, so if it's that big of a deal to me he won't use anymore.

I want to believe him, but given his history of being very secretive (about other things, too, over the years), I don't feel that just his word alone is enough. I ordered some pee tests and told him if he wants us to stay, he needs to test regularly for awhile to prove he's clean. He refuses. He said he's not pissing on a stick for me, it's degrading and belittling. I suggested a joint bank account so I can see any large cash withdrawals (I'm very good with money and he knows I'd never take advantage there. I am a saver, not a spender). Originally he agreed to that but since changed his mind. I also told him he needs to cut all ties with his weed supplier who he's been getting the coke from, and I'll get his weed from now on from somewhere else.

He works all week out of town and is usually only home on the weekends. I just found this out last Sunday, so when he left at 6am last Monday it was not on good terms. I'm torn between being pissed, but also trying to believe him and not be overly skeptical. Plus, if he really is addicted I want to be supportive and help him, not be the enemy. So, I took the week to change my tone and decided I was going to be kind, while still keeping my boundaries clear and in place. 

Everything was going ok after he got home on Friday night. We talked some and have been getting along good. He's been eating well and seemed pretty normal to me, but I did spot some red flags and I realized that I have no idea how to tell if he's still using, just coming down, or if what I'm seeing are residual effects of stopping long term use.

The red flags: The past 3 nights he stayed up until 3am. We had some amazing nookie that lasted an unusually long time and it took him quite awhile to ""get there"" 2 out of 3 of them. He's had plenty of bouts of sniffling/sneezing/runny nose. I found a tissue in the bathroom yesterday that was obviously from a nosebleed because it was twisted with snot and blood. He also kept his truck locked all weekend and he never locks his truck. 

Other than that, he's seemed pretty well ok. During all this time using though, he's never really gotten hyper when he's high. He doesn't talk more or differently, making it hard for me to pinpoint. He is is a heavy marijuana user and drinks moderately most nights, for what it's worth. The only signs I've seen in more recent months is the unexplainable missing money, days where he doesn't eat as much (he normally eats a lot), and a few occasions where he was just way ""off"" (forgetful, spacey, nauseous, sleeping all weekend, disrupted sleep during the night, irritable, more emotional). He's also fallen into a more withdrawn pattern and doesn't seem to enjoy socializing as much or doing the things we used to enjoy.

I tried coke myself just 2 times in my younger years before having kids, but I am not keen on the drug or the signs of it's usage vs the signs of come down at all. Do the sniffles and nosebleeds continue even a week or more after the last use? If he's been using for a year and just quit cold turkey last week, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume he'd be going through some withdrawal symptoms right now? I was expecting he'd be feeling like crap this weekend and instead he seems just fine. 

If our relationship is to continue, I need for him to be totally transparent and honest with me. I don't want to sit back with rose colored glasses and be played the fool again. The safety and wellbeing of my children is of utmost priority to me and I will do whatever I have to do to keep them safe, including leaving if that's what it takes.",5.506827359008547,5.406323843062202,6.3916260098831295,79.7502345281983,67.50717703349282,9.41705231782885,29.18856380892619,9.116212511846443,2.2090886344026988,4076,126,826,67,61,1355,427,1045,0.09,0.7809999999999999,0.129,0.9945,3,1,2,0,0,0,127.0,11,0,2,7,48,42,7,0,51,3,77,22,8,18,15,204,150,82,0,24,43,1,5,1,1,4,6,3,3,5,44,62,7,9,25,10,10,10,24,12,2,5,40,16,86,30,119,91,35,136,0,2,6,1,116,47,3,35,75,529,130,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14653641712542828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046405806057519115,0.0,0.1433263033826768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030469815306474312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0444358022526824,0.0,0.0,0.03687176090316552,0.07977419944650631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0344532731296277,0.0,0.05462699994236018,0.0,0.03812685469457887,0.15144404407245915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05124646197519065,0.0,0.0,0.094798232517546,0.07719330696780748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558540746835474,0.046193320028581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04681303902669357,0.0,0.0,0.03921028842511031,0.0,0.0,0.04389310862011357,0.05196107412974645,0.13754406909067332,0.03742990788385781,0.05040104818996666,0.0,0.046296877528017914,0.0,0.05918826710639059,0.0,0.037751233828080016,0.0,0.04026900648434502,0.0,0.12671815445559806,0.0,0.06796622315043814,0.03200962424458193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.196511147714704,0.03461723036283347,0.0,0.09363775387372633,0.0,0.07639334560010654,0.15032556898601468,0.03583568516644437,0.09879819110623217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027527427859138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030032713320832582,0.047340307958681806,0.08988872912161071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05058085028100099,0.0,0.046766128227273926,0.04446333148447187,0.07965178282303563,0.0,0.046658858558456286,0.07387309955479013,0.25566175966567994,0.0,0.04744339413563445,0.04868216779602142,0.0,0.031648009402897075,0.02189009121428039,0.08981535204398394,0.0,0.11895647641145145,0.0,0.05012678019190935,0.0,0.038092707511849636,0.040439428247095434,0.0,0.029908548104778467,0.0,0.04501394309265538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047532395558658035,0.04524158248766105,0.0,0.035763955118169766,0.0,0.09881334118025592,0.09966989423244367,0.10367212476178016,0.0,0.0,0.16819068063048453,0.13170195983139493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108570998230804,0.10223161326134482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04277267603520191,0.0,0.0,0.04681303902669357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09116821505107928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953140145697708,0.0,0.0,0.05740811648659061,0.04606833106653425,0.0442408082754071,0.09621037950545384,0.0,0.03826432889373332,0.12786313383554967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07140962790803743,0.1631598631838573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03706422809023677,0.0,0.08967730194067383,0.045674372514202775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551509206687764,0.10734708897222654,0.03746006674088678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050845649638999714,0.042229400328027335,0.04657089382844242,0.06737751134855761,0.14405440240157372,0.039162674476472266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1190692389020888,0.0,0.044021954790817525,0.0,0.1306345471108044,0.0,0.0,0.08562866504283595,0.09956287899145533,0.0912615941356761,0.0,0.04376923706765578,0.0,0.05389645290611808,0.3869825054535708,0.049347800895296584,0.11090965117815346,0.18499538504720564,0.03556514934732436,0.21564543054508165,0.0,0.08057247577726441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032619514508893124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442689163738607
addiction,elcalzone,2019/04/08,"Attention all people living in Belgium. I’m doing a survey for my thesis regarding problem gambling. It would be great if you took the time to complete it. Thanks! Hey guys, I don’t know if I’m posting this on the right subreddit but I’ll give it a try.

I’m a student at the University of Liège and I am currently working on my thesis on the influence of gambling advertising and marketing on young people and children in Belgium. I constructed a survey in order to gather data on the behavior of people living in Belgium regarding gambling.

It is a very short survey that should only take three minutes to complete so if you live in Belgium, it would be awesome if you took the time to complete it.

The main demographics that interest me are the 11 to 15 years old, 16-18 and 19-25. But even If you are older you can still complete the survey so don’t hesitate.

Here are the links to the survey:

addiction,ShredasaurusX,2019/04/08,"I can do this My apologies if this isn't the point of this thread but I need to vent. I've been fighting a coke addiction for a number of years now and just broke a 5 day streak of cleanliness. I really want to stop and have a good support structure, but just can't seem to be left alone. Alcohol certainly doesn't help the cause, but isn't a major issue. I don't feel like rehab is the answer, and counselling isn't much different than talking with friends who have dealt with similar issues. Last year I went and got help and just ended up being prescribed ciprulex (escilatopram) which I found was merely a cop out. After what was a really good clean streak I was badly injured and broke my arm which put me right back. Since healing and falling down the hole I've been really wanting to stop again. I've found myself playing more music as a distraction, but constantly feel like I need to just get away and hide. Is there any end to this? Any advice?",4.72907203907204,5.745716730158732,5.001693121693123,85.09750915750918,69.52910052910053,8.355067155067157,26.707773707773708,8.617729084823388,1.750222303622304,758,23,151,12,13,239,115,189,0.218,0.6509999999999999,0.131,-0.9548,1,1,1,0,2,0,17.0,0,0,0,0,8,13,1,1,12,0,19,7,1,1,1,34,32,14,0,5,9,0,2,2,1,0,5,0,1,0,8,11,2,2,6,1,0,3,6,5,0,0,9,2,12,8,19,21,3,23,0,2,0,0,7,7,0,2,15,93,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14617726325904715,0.0,0.13103063212565022,0.0,0.1433008138393487,0.0,0.13887620282837793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823708113334024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12598142673039167,0.10310648933284522,0.11195906716875448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13774677390817966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14490302997094473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08647658480320176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14009490740933864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23752685760847544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355992822682535,0.19158702096633196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2940442622011375,0.1035971554780608,0.0,0.07005618910725883,0.0,0.0,0.2249356921299556,0.10724356076264396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17975462731800454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799090398791377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10930077630736486,0.0,0.0,0.14568855027721148,0.0,0.0,0.13101863778157669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985711543284746,0.1988512160188347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267578461339412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13479690572091094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25770335351911544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11451163446986055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12206997452477353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11092015623124736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2242095232749023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521630880294177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077759988774088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581788314793783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12430223837520575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17269838405421015
addiction,BDady,2019/04/08,"Addiction question I'm not sure if this is the right place to be asking this. I understand what I'm experiencing isnt that serious and there are way worse situations. I'm 18 and I'm addicted to nicotine (classic teen w a juul) and have a mental and physical dependency to weed. I've been juuling and smoking weed basically everyday for the past year and a half. When I stop smoking weed I cant sleep, when eating i get full very fast, I'm irritable, and have stomach pains. I also get stressed about not having any weed often and when I try to stop it's all I can think about. It normally takes 1-2 days for the symptoms to kick in. I spend around $50/week on weed and $15/week on juul pods. I uber a lot as I dont have a car but the amount I spend on uber is about the same I'll be paying for gas and car insurance. I also spend a lot of money of fast food. I make around $500-$700/month. In 5 months I'm going to have to start paying for college as well. I cannot afford to pay for college if I continue like this so I want to try to get it figured it out early. I've tried completely quitting and leaning myself off and neither has seemed to work. For weed I'm thinking only at night and gradually start to make days where I dont smoke it all. For ex 1 week I dont smoke Monday, the next week I dont smoke Monday and Tuesday and from there. And for nicotine I was thinking only during work as its something I do really enjoy during breaks especially when it's a busy day. Will these uses just keep me experiencing the withdrawal? Any tips are appreciated.",3.0846100917431194,4.1265420519877685,5.060141437308868,83.05149655963305,73.434250764526,8.141131498470948,26.16322629969419,8.59863814320734,1.7011428134556574,1229,41,263,22,24,425,164,327,0.043,0.885,0.07200000000000001,0.8799,1,0,4,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,3,18,7,0,1,14,0,24,8,2,4,3,48,49,29,0,4,6,1,0,1,0,1,4,0,0,0,13,19,2,3,7,0,7,3,10,3,1,1,2,2,23,4,39,44,8,45,0,0,0,0,3,14,0,8,27,155,36,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21290947097870785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15618401228763998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13281297001074238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1738613813728723,0.09129113052533157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023859193075117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18893174812556413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4577881252980717,0.0,0.0,0.09992203836022548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180807883807192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15305690326659924,0.0,0.05549769510227045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679729214776521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04770767395096236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1660399175220558,0.0,0.0,0.13036649755014287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984099166082623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15588926453275026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10385366010971664,0.09163947827539208,0.09567790432108048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14853699253573288,0.10390826306597628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09321956963643634,0.0,0.0,0.10202521226052327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10939222033086436,0.10386457245745613,0.0,0.0,0.06255816105723719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833939936085656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889841388122076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10976456982530497,0.09772219402623247,0.0,0.0,0.0751770272858,0.0,0.0,0.13823671091089054,0.0,0.0,0.16328233927957758,0.11185965937999284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203554440558416,0.10149747648939862,0.0734219038097764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877137436275741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19889722407504465,0.0,0.0,0.10165883354577546,0.0,0.0843396905667594,0.0,0.08057285561500199,0.057597485716063025,0.07751135125341732,0.3133211213771502,0.0,0.0878005798645528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14218315925643502,0.0,0.0995153955248294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288447458942267
addiction,BrutalQueen138,2019/04/08,"Without my DOC, I'm doing much worse to get a high I began using drugs with my mother about 2 years ago, It was meth and heroin but i quit heroin on my own in December and now she is quitting meth and getting on methadone. I feel awful for having some resentment for her, but she got me into this mess and now I'm being forced out of it. I know it's for the best but it's so hard. I've been clean from meth for 2 weeks but without it I find myself turning to liquor, phenibut, dxm and whatever else I can get my hands on to not feel like I'm without something. 

I really want to go into treatment, but my mother would never let that happen. Shes very overbearing, narcissistic, and if I got treatment on my own before she did I'm fairly certain she'd cut me out of her life. 
I know this is a unique situation but I appreciate any advice I can get. Thank you!

addiction,MichaelsEuphoria,2019/04/08,Is it an addiction if it's not negatively affecting your life? For example I think I'm addicted to video games. I don't enjoy the video games I'm playing but have relapsed a bunch of times. I tell myself to take 1 month off playing video games no matter what but always break the promise within a few days every single time. The cravings make play the video games but I don't enjoy them.

addiction,ChancyPants95,2019/04/09,"6 months and a day sober Yesterday made six months, got my chip and everything to prove it. Today’s been far more difficult than I’ve expected guys, so I felt like sharing a bit to get me through. PAWS are really kicking my ass right now.


To this point I’ve overdosed twice, heroin had always been my drug of choice and at some point I’d graduated to speed balls, imagine that graduating from heroin to heroin and cocaine, lost my house, my fiancé, my car, everything. Funny thinking back on it now but I never really considered myself an addict.

I’d always been in the ‘I can quit whenever I want’ camp, God was I fucking stupid. Even after waking up in the goddamn hospital after three days of medically induced coma and a couple shots of naloxone, I figured I wasn’t a junkie.

I honestly don’t know how I cleaned up or gotten this far guys, but here we are. Rehab and Vivitrol, moved far away from the place I grew up, the people I grew up with, the woman I loved. 

I don’t really have some incredible awakening story that put me into rehab, just one day I felt my life was getting tiring and the possibility of dying seemed realer everyday. And suddenly we’re half a year removed and I’m confused how I’ve made it this far.

I would be lying if I said I didn’t think about using at least three or four times a day, it feels like something’s lodged into my deepest being calling back to the needle, and then I remember how it ended last time. 

In and out of consciousness, seizing, hot dose full of fent, waking up in the hospital. Or when I totaled my car, ran into a telephone pole after nodding out on the drive back. Or when I found one of my best friends facedown in his own vomit, narcan couldn’t bring him back.

I guess if anything I’m afraid of dying now, which is honestly weird to me, a few months back I could give a fuck less. But here we are six months later, scared shitless. I made a promise to myself that I’d never use again and I intend to make good on that promise, but it’s damn hard guys.


Anyways, thanks for listening guys, stay clean, stay positive, we all have rough nights. Tomorrow will be better.",4.7866428571428585,5.592118569047616,5.768571428571431,80.42142857142859,69.26190476190476,8.666666666666668,28.095238095238088,8.841846274778883,2.1144523809523808,1669,55,322,28,28,552,230,420,0.101,0.76,0.139,0.9667,0,0,3,0,0,0,50.0,3,0,0,4,21,23,4,3,20,0,24,16,3,11,5,69,56,29,2,7,11,0,6,2,1,2,10,2,2,5,14,21,0,0,14,1,0,10,7,10,0,9,19,8,43,13,48,30,12,80,0,1,0,4,18,30,4,11,40,214,57,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09282524454564398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14170198447346116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07007057269051235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000051775311888,0.3273725637345941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0893588783691106,0.07530758680718462,0.09296092107245506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08694689845999018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06798474273933862,0.0942160190079476,0.0,0.2196568728367544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17674294404237814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874609003479724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754169566185953,0.0,0.0,0.056240272651959834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15305330024494515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0430540162544239,0.060830636983041524,0.1635132549992316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09336175112847013,0.0657860947529329,0.1574382081471886,0.08897393125075764,0.08168291380293533,0.0,0.07141914605421554,0.06810162902076311,0.0,0.09380149216272356,0.3372445551297404,0.0,0.0,0.07627699767799727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825079530981708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046795797700230235,0.069407998641895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06014342925469916,0.08319923920424943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09295045846364364,0.0,0.07685051722896116,0.24171082070795896,0.05683778161686995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08577890525390493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27186125700796565,0.09050017095758356,0.0,0.0,0.13134469263489068,0.0,0.0,0.07990679739934342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539866293420042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05903176455408968,0.0,0.0889628369688769,0.0,0.16098711664358606,0.09599297878907613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08559850867754737,0.0,0.0905667023047209,0.0,0.0,0.1636463583823724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09645749468740933,0.07271698919516006,0.08099643009899757,0.0,0.08524924772794179,0.0,0.0,0.0775166738267781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06555204810702672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18151552943972735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07839398378541199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912039485896764,0.0,0.0,0.09930241794808256,0.09786653010799508,0.08071152714628943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470832155239597,0.0,0.0,0.05022323029812485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06048757994194301,0.0,0.0,0.05483332145868939
addiction,celticyinyang,2019/04/09,"Is reading about drugs , addiction and other's experiences making kicking harder? I just joined this sub today and created a throw away for privacy reasons. Im a long time (25 years  roughly) drug user - smoke about 10-15g weed per week, prescribed 60ml methadone daily, but occasionally smoke heroin (h3) and more recently been smoking crack quite regularly.
Im in a constant battle with myself, particularly with the C and H. It causes me so much anxiety, financial issues, interpersonal issues, health issues, yet like an abused partner i keep returning.
Although i have got help with the opiates by means of starting a methadone program (even though I am not progressing through it as well as id like) i have always tried to battle my addictions alone. Few friends know my situation, none know the true extent. Iv always felt that pressure from others would be counter productive so iv kept most of it to myself, with mixed results.
Has anyone here had success kicking their demons without the help of NA/rehab/therapy?
And will reading reddit all day about addiction and others struggles not make things harder? I wondering if the less i think about it the better.
Iv considered NA recently but i keep getting cold feet.",6.379607843137253,8.656555370370372,6.409738562091508,71.73852941176472,67.05555555555556,8.971241830065358,34.00217864923747,9.478462496947786,3.62196982570806,984,46,150,21,17,312,154,216,0.126,0.757,0.117,-0.2819,0,1,6,0,1,0,32.0,0,0,1,4,12,11,2,2,11,0,10,10,1,5,2,35,24,15,0,2,7,0,2,2,2,2,9,0,0,1,10,10,0,3,7,2,0,1,4,4,1,0,5,3,14,7,22,16,8,15,1,0,0,0,5,2,0,3,14,94,24,4,0.0,0.13264599600193416,0.0,0.3661358782796072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11594954272424665,0.0,0.0,0.1863077254939432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564373708096859,0.0,0.0,0.07828013927483543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10518352693721696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09901332901313001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11500656787204418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12098141886304258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07220042210310837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2596598700316542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739438993594916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10951151419094853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749243470448157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08649460858357581,0.0,0.058490820792589826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08953903964320943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1190008017710984,0.0,0.0,0.15007946945271072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418568982542137,0.3505495309928328,0.0,0.19901793719636396,0.0,0.0,0.1230528798111142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10938915976771857,0.0,0.0,0.09907488032064583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494589910580078,0.0,0.0,0.12194963502466005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08229833504529199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11907579399524745,0.22396658824649235,0.0,0.0,0.11510632774297762,0.2210801589321109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12583986045721876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07924090824014228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11703758116588225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12802801007301762,0.0,0.07437659732765428,0.07173496068780448,0.10999325216969696,0.0,0.06528069346629768,0.0,0.10611835183285023,0.0,0.0,0.0760087368895289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08980194213659219,0.0,0.10065919026333248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10791869507010056,0.12140825079225685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795281977277252,0.0,0.0,0.0720940602222825

addiction,dudesBangMyMom,2019/04/09,"Still withdrawing after six months April 1 marked 6 months from when I entered rehab on October 1, last year.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first left rehab, I felt  I was on my road to recovery and doing much better. I was really feeling it and going to meetings and feeling physically better. Fast forward five months and I am wondering if I will ever start feeling happy again. I don't know why but this past week has been really weird. I have  started feeling physical withdrawal symptoms again. Out of nowhere I started getting RLS last night after not dealing with that shit for months. I have very little energy. I have tried so hard to exercise, eat right, and let my body heal, but I still just feel like shit most of the  time. I probably need more of a social life but I am pretty busy with work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been very preoccupied with thinking about opiates lately too. Im having vivid using dreams and fantasizing about smoking tar and snorting pills. I am trying to fight it. I don't consciously want to use, but I am worried and don't know why I am not feeling closer to my old self by now.

&amp;#x200B;

Short backstory: I have been on/off opiate user for the last eight years. This is the longest I have been clean in those eight years. Before going to rehab last time, I was smoking tar all day and supplementing my high by snorting oxymorphone and oxycontin.

addiction,Yurikoneko,2019/04/09,"My brother didn’t last in rehab and I don’t know what else to do My baby brother is now 27. He’s been doing drugs since he was 13 (bad home life, sexual abuse, ptsd, bipolar disorder). About a month or two ago he went to rehab for meth addiction. We thought he was getting better and the therapy would help. He just admitted to us that he’s been smoking and injecting heroin and the girl he was with almost overdosed. He said he feels totally out of control and doesn’t know what to do. I’m at a total loss. I don’t know if i can keep going if he dies. I’m so terrified. Any advice is much appreciated. He’s a good dude and so smart. I just want him to be able to have a real life.

addiction,Jubilantjerk,2019/04/09,"Yesterday was rough Yesterday started just as any other day, I had class then went to work. I was at work and I scratched my arm on a sharp corner, no big deal. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and the scratch looked just like a track mark. Then I realized I was wearing the shirt I overdosed in last June. All day I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach and was extremely anxious. Then, to top it off, a hypodermic needle was found in a bin of someone’s belongings. (I work at a charity place, not goodwill, that accepts donations and we sort through them.) it was unused, clean, in the packaging, and not the right type or gauge. I’m sure it was an honest, innocent mistake but damn I had a rough day. I didn’t want to use, at all, I just felt sick all day. PTSD to the fucking max every time I looked at my scarred up arm and the fresh scratch right on my favorite vein. Today is a new day and I’m feeling great. 10 months sober ❤️",2.7747692307692304,4.02546052820513,3.8820512820512825,90.3846153846154,74.48717948717949,7.2512820512820495,27.871794871794872,7.793537801064563,1.4863948717948716,733,29,163,10,15,238,114,195,0.07400000000000001,0.774,0.152,0.9057,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,1,4,3,8,2,0,17,0,12,8,6,1,4,29,26,13,0,2,7,0,9,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,6,8,0,0,6,0,1,2,4,3,0,0,15,11,20,5,22,11,3,38,0,0,2,1,3,19,2,2,18,98,26,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10770587314203106,0.0,0.0,0.17892771132339108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5107196707888865,0.16328592139350526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334445109281111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601664102643601,0.0,0.15207252053504328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17365878767123305,0.0,0.14642253401154706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17461781981476146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291032864438474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737793497198532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.266003665278867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12641980183570078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15296729112709975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16547652790434408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1851412547263309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2705164381365772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13419740436675628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210430463030632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14927410582722206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923544026608742,0.0,0.15012856749046405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13679206198441018,0.0,0.0,0.0934183986598969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14682263043985594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3459141372842158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,LSDevil,2019/04/09,"Any advice and tips for staying clean I've done nos and lsd a few days ago and while everything was great at first after about to nangs I started to see a blue swirl kinda like a alien abduction beam lol anyways when that happened i felt a good bit of heat in the top of my head and in the left side of my face and saw a flash of light out the corner of my eye I got a weird nerve malfunction and basically my whole left side of my body went numb to pain only pain and it's been like that for the past 3 days but my feeling is starting to come back so be really careful and please dont go ham on the tanks I learned my lesson and I hope to help other people before they mess up like I did again please be safe and make sure to take your b12

Edit: This was me days ago now I'm trying to clean myself up as much as possible I'm only 18 and still young and maybe a little dumb and I am very jumpy when it comes to making decisions I've pretty much destroyed my brain by taking all sorts of different drugs and being high almost every single day for 4 years(14) I made so many irrational decisions and I'm trying my best to quit it's hard to get rid of all the drugs i try to throw them away but it's just like throwing away the most valuable thing to me I  called hotlines not only for my addiction but also for the mental problems that the substance abuse has brought in really looking for tips and help and am starting therapy on the 22nd but I'm always afraid of relapse as it's so easy to get ahold of things it's almost 2nd nature and if I cant get ahold of soemthing then I can cook crap I feel like I've already ruined myself by making even worse decisions while under the influence I skipped my 1st year of highschool and quitting drugs has made it increasingly hard to focus or even care about school I also decided that it would be cool to get hand tattoos but that was just another irrational decision I made but if anyone has any tips or anything please let me know and feel free to PM me I'd love to reach out to the community and talk about it as it seems everytime I discuss these problems I feel better like I can keep going and again thanks to the people reading this and just know that we can overcome this the post above was what it took for me to change my ways I dont want anyone else to suffer irreversible damage 

PS I also am still in school and work so I dont think I really have time to do inpatient treatment or I would",3.8368319327731086,4.615892268627455,4.692464985994398,87.37323529411766,71.41176470588233,7.789355742296919,24.96358543417367,7.957251820313856,1.1840291316526603,1947,53,417,25,35,631,259,510,0.122,0.6890000000000001,0.189,0.9905,1,0,3,0,1,0,3.0,1,1,2,8,24,34,3,1,21,2,30,16,7,7,3,83,77,51,0,8,15,0,8,6,0,2,7,0,2,0,25,29,1,2,16,2,1,10,5,14,0,1,16,15,47,21,65,54,11,61,0,3,5,1,10,22,2,12,32,258,72,7,0.0,0.0805482106414707,0.0,0.07411101914360498,0.0,0.06643176557939633,0.1205248656855322,0.0,0.13614941679528544,0.0,0.07502043952241158,0.16309687311747464,0.05656693141721601,0.0,0.0,0.09246093673277228,0.07128563603283772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950699657343772,0.06965616102031827,0.05594384996762842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12774369583878314,0.05227438819424921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05784814683445104,0.0,0.07134349688901517,0.060125045022441134,0.07421934232363052,0.07551329261890043,0.0,0.07589101414260893,0.06941778917778026,0.0,0.13862549048065395,0.0,0.07191652862858851,0.11712190244598153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17537249470777758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07102730023434388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06956975642058348,0.23902514313987466,0.0,0.2365145409983761,0.0,0.056790701058622925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08980367234263434,0.0,0.057278234335416615,0.0,0.06109833655685931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13749608906321695,0.048566750607924286,0.06527391352856869,0.0,0.0,0.05782592623543946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14207231566116305,0.0,0.07727210490437299,0.05702054140930642,0.05437185925846617,0.07495100647397633,0.0,0.0,0.060116748539384264,0.0,0.12179803161953633,0.0,0.06976971401311853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09113454670927904,0.07182730146295915,0.0,0.06752201608127394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0604260181607365,0.0,0.0,0.07472286824941689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477264890294794,0.0695167680634402,0.0,0.1992770535509088,0.06813637939254201,0.0,0.0,0.05708822404141705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061356909765542415,0.1929802108078006,0.13613664931687675,0.06892364010625754,0.06829761359758328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06851042539488404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09994999964527916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15511138861150184,0.14467646249576988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06489704077631613,0.09426108715065536,0.0,0.0,0.2238732906019652,0.0,0.07664011577357846,0.06510849521730977,0.0691626982235637,0.0,0.13010024706387222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446156299642804,0.0680009516701392,0.0,0.13065409585744392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13760394939250464,0.054173294305404934,0.0618887644847527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14435520620438547,0.07246035786393469,0.10858191188093982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407275319392887,0.0,0.10222884108993777,0.0546418022744754,0.0,0.06258920255477814,0.07774397595249982,0.0,0.0903291770413694,0.04356047598869582,0.0,0.0,0.03964117430327828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07553111959137447,0.13846707629563038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05609272727501633,0.04009787208530095,0.05396138753417106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0630205092257921,0.0,0.07590009444224156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049492109435590514,0.0,0.06928003107538239,0.0965857125821715,0.0,0.0,0.043778536283135217

It’s becoming a thing I do out of habit almost like smoking a cigarette. When I talk to my gf on FaceTime (we are long distance) all I can think about is having sex with her and fantasizing what I want to do. I’ve tried many times to quit porn and always relapse after a few days.

addiction,chadams123,2019/04/09,"I believe I am completely in control of my addiction. I’ve been taking drugs for years, always been open to trying anything I’ve come across! 
Never actually thought about the consequences and know I’ve been incredibly lucky so far, didn’t get hooked by meth or heroine and found I really don’t enjoy weed... 
Cocaine is the one I fell in love with, lost everything multiple times because of it. To get to that stage so frequently in such a small amount of time eventually made me wake up and try to change.

I never fully stopped, but got back in control! 
I’ve now got a great paying job which takes me away for weeks on end, during that time I don’t drink or take anything. When I get back from work I now smoke crack non stop for a minimum of 3 days but I don’t get myself into debt and always pay up front. I’m fully aware I’m addicted, made peace with it and feel as if I’m in control. Always have a tiny notion this could be a self indulgent illusion though...

A month ago, inspired by your stories, I finally got the guts to quit methylphenidate as a whole, and I've been working my way out of prescription antidepressants, that a dumb boy with a dumb thought process thought ""more pills = happier boy""

Today I went out, breathed in, and admired the colors of the world that we're definitely not the gray I saw everyday before

I'm thankful for you all, everyone on this sub that, without knowing, got the most sincere smile since ages from a boy that fiercely thought suicide was an option",10.044489795918366,6.990943755102041,8.654795918367348,76.64913265306124,60.42857142857143,12.248979591836735,42.18707482993197,10.125756701596842,3.9862299319727885,600,26,122,9,6,183,98,147,0.08800000000000001,0.765,0.146,0.8338,1,0,2,0,0,1,14.0,0,3,0,3,1,6,2,0,13,0,8,4,2,1,1,22,21,6,1,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,8,7,0,0,7,0,0,2,4,2,0,1,15,4,13,4,18,6,5,21,0,0,3,0,7,6,2,3,12,73,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275228070643568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466325859538194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222657406620619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646602203038498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16545530427121513,0.1887693702577096,0.0,0.1465762615238626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2756418921768446,0.0,0.0,0.1706250067710535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09470318411974868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171550725104595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16305441572537308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750901570519121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16883811598555815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832847286507577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14716129983503062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850916318584429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13266122144287826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18849134270871612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15865014050767928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.410411176142266,0.0,0.0,0.16334027822082692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13678048872396148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15974340997214287,0.0,0.1923903829461474,0.0,0.16611141591931522,0.0,0.12545183187317105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,pewyroll,2019/04/10,"I've been Addicted to opiates (Codiene) for since i was 18, I'm 30 and feel like all is lost..  i was just 18 when my appendix burst and i had my first taste of it, I'm 30 now and am still fighting to feel free  of this, but not only would i take solely phosphates, the last 10 years have been a mis-match of neurophen + (28 to 30 tabs in a go),  co-codamol 30/500 (15- 20 tabs). (i sincerely don't think im going to be around much longer because of it.) i should preface that i suffer from schizophrenia and manic depression

&amp;#x200B;

in the last decade i have been unable to maintain a job, a relationship.. Hell i scared all my friends away who wanted to help me. I've tried cold turkey, and I've tried reducing but something always breaks and I cave. It doesn't matter how much i want my life to be better. I've even moved back in with my parents and am unable to tell them the truth. the feeling of"" F\*\*k it whats the point in any of this?"" kicks in every time, I've single handedly brought down my own life because of this dumb medication that i can't help abuse. and in low moments i think of ending it, even as close to being so selfish as when visiting friends to just go somewhere remote and do it then. 

&amp;#x200B;

the worst part is other than abject misery, it's stolen my emotions. my grandfather passed away 3 years ago and i was high at his funeral. I'll never forgive myself for that.. i couldn't even shed a tear. everything i do is based around it. i have to be near a pharmacy where ever i go just in case. having to use the toilet so much that it physically hurts to go anywhere near your rectum (sorry for the details) as opposed to swallowing tablets seems like a no brainer at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have no concept of finances, the friends i do have left lecture me upon the steps that i should take to get me back on my feet. I'm by no means an idiot, but i have to blag the situation and nod like i understand what they are talking about, and in my head all i think is... ""my stomachs starting to hurt, the sweats are coming. how can I get this by them without them knowing?""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to start, i don't know how to be honest with  myself, and being 30 and living with your parents isn't the worst thing in the world, but reverting back into your teenage self because you need to satiate this dumb desire is.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I need help, but i don't know how to stop myself from using during the intense anxiety, i guess i just needed to write this out as it's the only way i feel i can be honest, through complete anonymity..",4.5792058516196485,4.924485015325672,5.272577499129223,85.43471786833857,69.53639846743296,7.93646812957158,28.845001741553467,7.686295010490155,1.6130567049808433,2006,68,419,21,33,650,250,522,0.165,0.72,0.115,-0.9877,3,0,1,0,3,0,93.0,0,4,4,3,26,28,5,1,25,0,46,12,6,7,6,78,86,33,1,10,11,2,5,3,3,3,4,0,0,1,26,23,2,2,16,0,2,11,14,15,0,1,9,7,60,14,71,66,11,65,1,6,0,0,26,29,3,2,26,288,86,3,0.0,0.07627228216072063,0.0,0.07017681110881592,0.0,0.0,0.05706338160550616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05356405709897537,0.3487442669697388,0.3911053250877088,0.04377630861793271,0.0,0.04924568759574891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461244315375747,0.0,0.0,0.12096237937100175,0.1484981548706699,0.0,0.11772479013880473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056933287063196385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05545222370191928,0.06749457679282167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055444954673621163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07241172347252342,0.057015971731940784,0.0,0.0,0.1275546219109886,0.0582296773605399,0.05423760026581523,0.0,0.057854911093657015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13019706356612587,0.045988568541704786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05475621775964912,0.0,0.0,0.14920483218742736,0.0,0.06726517982856424,0.0,0.18292522395850486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709148640485584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06606596560124653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294449586001242,0.06801432533878486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13782670776190944,0.0,0.06953461899405204,0.0,0.06388094255471577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1768904500047196,0.10494627908549456,0.0,0.0,0.0699421896783139,0.0,0.0909380652839125,0.09434918253023547,0.0,0.0568431371978767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07027147408023786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012180730929972,0.0,0.06484970829421631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06841903227610648,0.14196618113916926,0.14319680004456953,0.049648949110238316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09791816606311678,0.0,0.0,0.14295870297635874,0.06971042028076313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060853933275094266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.069113239169918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06444928191953972,0.0,0.0,0.058603378892803364,0.06715578570094596,0.0,0.0,0.053250571795192166,0.07235871140594963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04955800246279777,0.0,0.07206106235217734,0.09112804146573374,0.0,0.05140890253538183,0.05381927740628522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680198915009487,0.051741124075366525,0.05626543209867787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04276701135740598,0.1237441610138457,0.0,0.0,0.07507361883183215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08741100374614534,0.0,0.0,0.06701526922677754,0.0,0.11119637856732753,0.0,0.0,0.07593852648937544,0.051096829377253315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0620539285685145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0457292139955298,0.0,0.3911053250877088,0.08290907632531533

I still smoke weed and cigarettes, but I know that dropping everything at once is not the way forward. However I can't keep it up forever.

I (30f) knew that before my husband (34m) and I got together that he had suffered with IV use with heroin/opiates, and he was adamant that he would never stick another needle in his arm, which, I was happy to hear because, drugs are bad. Duh. Anyway, I have known that my husband has been doing meth for the past year and a half, which is heartbreaking, but, I just recently found out he's not smoking it, but shooting it. I have been so paranoid that he was cheating, or any crazy ass thing I could imagine because he had changed SO much.  Specifically, the time spent in the bathroom and the high volume and frequency of ""shits"" he would take throughout the day. We've been married for 3 years, together 5, and it was fucking weird that suddenly I couldn't even talk to him through the door without him getting VERY upset with me. I was so confused by this and all the other secretive behaviors he had begun exhibiting, that looking back now, I feel so stupid. I found out he was using needles not only for meth but also heroin (when Suboxone is not available) - and who the fuck knows?? I felt so betrayed by this, even more so than if I had discovered it was an affair he had been hiding instead. I am pissed at him, and I hate that feeling. As selfish as it seems, I feel like it's a total slap in the face when he goes to take his 4th ""shit"" for the day, when he knows I think it's fucked up. J know he's really suffering, and I am trying hard not to let resentment and disgust build. I get no one chooses to be a drug addict, but it seems like you'd really have to think about syringes and spoons and whatever else goes along with it, and it seems like a lot of trouble to even get high at all. 
I don't know, I'm just tired and I know this is written weird but I love this man, and I know he is really struggling and hurting and I'm trying desperately to understand what the deal is with this shit, and what I could do to encourage him to ditch the needle shit instead of make him want it more. As addict myself, I can understand how easy it can be falling back into addiction, and I did know he had struggled with this before, so I guess my question is, will this ever go away? What is the huge draw to it? Is it the rush of it all?

addiction,Kittykat_0923,2019/04/12,"Did clonidine help your opiate withdrawals? Help So please no mean comments, I'm already feeling awful and guilty as it is. I quit methadone about 6 months using kratom and benzos. I quit the benzos after the acute stuff was over but kept using the kratom for my serious sciatic nerve pain under the guise that it was easy to quit and had minimal withdrawals. I ended up getting pregnant with my soon to be second child, currently 26 weeks, (should be noted that the whole reason I was on methadone was because when I got pregnant with my first I was addicted to pills and my doctor told me methadone was the best route, however I completely regret it because the hardest thing I've ever done is watch my baby go through withdrawals) so I decided to stop the kratom day before yesterday, around 12gpd taken throughout the day, and while it was the only symptom I noticed, the full body rls was just too much and I only made it 24 hours. I refuse to go back on methadone so I'm curious if clonidine works well for rls during withdrawals because it seems to be safe for pregnancy. Or if anyone has any tips to ease withdrawal during pregnancy.",6.939320632638387,7.542322285046732,6.434672897196264,78.24896836808053,64.46728971962617,9.014521926671463,33.75125808770669,8.841846274778883,2.881014090582315,915,37,158,13,13,283,129,214,0.093,0.775,0.132,0.8397,2,0,4,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,0,6,12,6,0,0,11,1,18,6,1,4,1,29,33,16,0,4,5,0,1,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,10,9,0,4,5,0,0,2,1,3,1,2,16,2,18,3,22,13,4,25,0,1,1,0,7,7,0,4,16,107,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14634962027453638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14814548448806686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09129292200697524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09386899239490408,0.0,0.0,0.1195087612935303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032280617742959,0.0,0.2455081395334188,0.0,0.1142347578084556,0.0,0.14088449733140526,0.0,0.0,0.14911873872685294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14075597805240106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17315709798396478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13740803259449666,0.0,0.1373818300220061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11890346227922274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12143457412463167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787958341472898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141908780148002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07013879207438155,0.0,0.15259192683150352,0.0,0.10737001120816043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799665752666401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322067721393297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12702825616028807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14623491307930106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10715509537631754,0.0,0.09868737917490146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15284169944875606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20420258764815688,0.14284883404377102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14736347103670758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4283663099415409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13802881680595494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12221390673434468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11223694390511148,0.0,0.0,0.1536813001491541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395345831706347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918809181466032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827926524477473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2318935204108701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10768526859503484,0.0,0.1207046493891898,0.0,0.0,0.14988256980921585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977337986467223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Knottygirl420,2019/04/13,"My spouse is relapsing. Please help. We have 2 beautiful children and 1 on the way. He has already told me where he was for the past 24 hrs (alone doing cocaine) and am waiting for him to sober up enough to come home and go from there.. I dont know if there's much point in telling you what led up to this other than i am pregnant (hormonal, emotional, definitely stressing him out) and work has been hard, financial stress and all that. I do believe he is a good man who has never lied to me and is not a  cheater. I really want to support him and the 1st time this happened 3 weeks ago i got mad, i didnt understand, i did some research. This time i was more understanding when he finally told me what was going on and was just worried sick that i didnt know if he was alive or not. I think he was relieved to know that i am not freaking out at him at this point, i want to be calm and help us to get through this together and i think its possible. But if anyone has any experience, advice, thoughts, anything.. i have been an addict myself and had a relapse last fall, he basically took me out of that situation and helped me get better(i have known him for 13 years)  I think i am looking at a man that is exhausted and weary and probably desperate for some bit of escape. I definitely acknowledge that i may have pushed him to this. So also advice on my own behavior would be appreciated as well.",4.2297760358342655,4.9745115035461005,5.345938783128035,83.17026315789477,70.48936170212768,9.057409481149683,29.73572228443449,9.276330184999452,2.3576638297872337,1092,42,232,22,19,362,158,282,0.085,0.758,0.157,0.965,0,1,1,0,0,0,31.0,2,1,0,1,9,10,1,2,8,0,35,3,0,1,2,49,59,23,0,6,9,1,1,0,0,2,3,0,1,3,17,19,0,1,11,0,0,7,7,5,1,0,17,2,35,5,31,38,8,33,0,0,1,0,27,15,0,7,10,164,52,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12571864111426764,0.0,0.2253837929088566,0.102226514420914,0.0,0.0,0.11943941973898255,0.12726134145149615,0.0922234304482388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842331313561111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806362335926481,0.0,0.09490066224838313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992906336274107,0.0,0.10199345582481728,0.1259023957455135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09934019657518893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13515721204454365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297223873793852,0.0,0.1191590591233191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11280761788609485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12633025616136406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12050258295779985,0.0,0.1310809665940908,0.09672711378705152,0.09223400703187358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197938203946133,0.0,0.1033063854912728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2318948957236941,0.0,0.11567795669848273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19013483214164706,0.09400329958117468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09684192759793027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08477536997857026,0.0,0.08894388782089398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100884574657708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12658956882746378,0.21803423885819967,0.13000888830343174,0.0,0.0,0.1243372528415742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387860166643195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296274186159573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2642032655121088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13086670408453624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007970233099443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2216821699743989,0.0,0.09155325171443636,0.13449105472224526,0.0,0.0,0.22039134614025044,0.12812763643780248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24010975842243354,0.1387188717962825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13604049838714846,0.0915377010305458,0.0925048224272585,0.0,0.10368885459980487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08395621617433884,0.11711568408748607,0.0,0.08192185640677165,0.0,0.0,0.07426396445611884

Do you ever get caught up in addiction?  


today  


I am grateful for  


understanding about addiction  


I was out at dinner tonight talking with friends about different addictive behaviours.  


Drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, food, relationships, TV, and even things like computer games.  


Addictive behaviour is something I struggle with all the time. I struggle with being productive each day because of certain addictive behaviours I get involved in.  


today,  


I'm grateful for  


understanding more about the addictive behaviours

addiction,Suddy88,2019/04/13,"Weekend warrior Does anyone do well all week and throw it all away on the weekends? I workout hard all week, get plenty of sleep, and tell myself that this is the week I’m finally done. 

Friday or Saturday rolls around and I inevitably taking ~60mg (used to be around 100mg) adderall, stay up all night, drink/eat nothing, grind my teeth to shit, and skirt responsibility’s recovering the rest of the weekend. 

This might seem light compared to what other brave people on this sub are going through. But it’s a shitty cycle that I can’t break. It’s the only time I can disconnect and forget about my issues. 

It’s gotten hard to take myself seriously when I break my promise to myself weekly. Doing this wayyy too frequently over the last decade, at 30 worried about latent accrued cardiovascular damage. 

Feel absolutely pathetic. How do I break this habit? Find new friends and move on?

I know last year when I was going out to have ONS' and dates it would often trigger me to drink but just don't feel able to keep ignoring that area of my life.

addiction,ForeignAlgae,2019/04/13,"Does free online counseling exist? Help needed Hello.

I am a suboxone patient who has been on the same dosage for close to ten years now. A more recent requirement is that I attend some sort of counseling or therapy from a licensed doctor. For a while I was doing a local group session headed by a licensed substance abuse counselor until he left.  


My doctor changed and now they want proof again that I am attending some sort of counseling. The problem is, I'm very low income / insurance doesnt cover addiction treatment (insane deductible) and struggling to purchase my medicine / doctor visits as it is. I can not afford another 50-100$ to attend a counseling session or see a psychiatrist.   


I was suggested that there may be online group sessions or free/low cost therapy online. I am not looking to be prescribed anything I just need to show my current doctor that I am attending some sort of help. Does anyone know some good resources?

addiction,BurninateDabs,2019/04/14,"Addiction is just... absolute insanity. As quickly as I can sum up my own life to give you all an idea of where I'm coming from I was given opiates by my doctor at age 11. That progressed to stronger ones like Oxycontin, and by age 12 another doctor added Adderall &amp; Xanax to the concoction. I turned age 13 and began dating an 18 year old. I'm female by the way, so that makes it ew I know. Anyways everything changed when my doctors took me off of all those pills I began a horrible withdrawal.
   I got onto AIM (AOL's version of FB messenger back in the day) asking people of they k ew where to get any opiates. This 30 something year old friend of my adult bf, Tim replied saying he could get heroin and began telling me how it's basically the same thing. I didn't even care I just knew if I got more I could stop feeling like that. 
So began an almost sixteen year long he'll in which I went through several boyfriend's each one I dated for a few years and each one was a drug relationship.
In the one relationship my bf would run around scrapping for metal to support HIS habit I was often left without anything and always sick. He was a jerk. Anyways one day at the apartment we were being evicted from the landlord and sheriff showed up and I left. Bf wasn't coming to get his stuff. And somehow they thought a vibrator John made for me out of an MnM mini's tube was a pipe bomb so they had to detonate it. I also had misdemeanor warrants out for getting caught stealing something for like a dollar at a major retail store. I of course had ready worn my welcome out at my parents with stealing their stuff and doing typical drug addict stuff. They had moved to Arizona while I was still in PA. I ended up lasting maybe a month more after that apartment and then was just sick of the life I was living. I found this girl that was good at stealing stuff, or just stupid enough to do it. But she took me to some literal dark places man. I'd have to take her to this black guys house who only had his body from his belly button up, and he'd do some awful sexual shit to her. Like some stuff you'd see out of a m.gore movie. So I said screw that, begged my parents to let me come straighten my life out (for the fifth time) and my mother finally caved and sent me the $ to drive out there.
    I really thought things were going to be different I had every intention of doing well I was practically detoxed. Since that prostitute lady did mostly crack and only some heroin I was often dope sick. But it did help me get thru the worst of it. So with 1 Suboxone I drove through four days there and was doing great. Until I met Glen.
So stupid! Dumb! Argh! Can't believe I got into a relationship immediately. We were attached at the hip and infatuated with each other, one of the first things we did was get a bunch of cocaine. Eventually that lead to heroin. And so began the craziest time in my life so far...
   For some stupid reason Glen &amp; I were trying to have a baby the first week into knowing each other. We were doing meth and heroin daily, and sometimes cocaine on occasion. Things got worse than they ever had with my parents, I was returning their stuff to Walmart for cash, pawning my dad's tools, my mom's jewelry. Selling the catalytic converters off all our vehicles for $. As Glen and I got worse he began taking bolder moves. Breaking into houses, cars, stealing cars, taking from stores, it was insanity. He actually became addicted to the stealing. For almost a year we stayed out of legal trouble for the most part, but I became pregnant and he just kept on stealing.
  Of course he was caught several times, I remember he had just made a rather impressive score of 3 flat screens, lots of gold jewelry, rare coins, computers, laptops, a credit card, and some high end cell phones and shoes. He ended up leaving that night to look for more and he finally got arrested trying to steal gold jewelry out of a case in JC Penny and then they found that stolen credit card. Once all of the items he stole from that one score were sold, every last dime went to bailing him out twice in a row. The second time, he was so dope sick and impatient even though I was headed toward him and was 60 miles away he decided to walk across the parking lot from the jail he was released at and he broke the wiper off of a Jeep and tried using it as a slim Jim. He was spotted doing that and immediately re-arrested less than an hour after being released. Once he went back I got him out on bond one last time...
   I was trying so hard to get him to just spend time with me &amp; not go steal. What do you think happened? Wrong! He actually didn't get caught stealing again, but got so twacked out on meth and was up for almost a week and we were on our way to his court hearing &amp; he started messing with the car. He was on ""tweaker time"" &amp;hadn't real conception of time so he missed it. He was eventually caught by the bondsman and spent the next 4 years in prison and I had to give birth to my child alone.
    I was still using the entire time I was pregnant, I hadn't even been to the doctor to confirm the pregnancy. The only time time I had gone to the doctor at all during the pregnancy is when I was 15 minutes from delivering my miracle child.. 
  My son had not much wring with him considering the ordeal he had been through in the womb of an addict. He hard a small tear in his lung, and when he was on his way out defecated inside me and breathed it in causing a minor infection they took care of. They also had to ween him off the opiates with baby morphine. He was premature by a month and was 5lbs 5oz. Beautiful baby boy, Connor. I lost custody of him, and unfortunately the paternal grandmother has him.  
    I say unfortunately because she's an awful person, after all my boyfriend Glen was an awful human being. She raised him. The way he spoke to people and has robbed people of at least a quarter million dollars in his criminal history even prior to meeting me. She also has some sort of delusion where she doesn't see behavior with her soon seems more on the lines of a partner, not a mother/son relationship so I fear for my son.  Glen, the bf St that time has basically been in &amp; out of prison since my son was born and he currently is in there. Now the grandma doesn't let me speak to him, nor does she say anything about my family to him. And I hate it! I don't even get to see pictures of him from recent or even talk to him. I do miss him, but I was thinking ready at that time to be a parent I still had to get sober.
   After I had Connor, Glen was still in prison not getting out for years, my parents moved back to PA, and I was just so alone. I began to steal, I got down to 94lbs &amp; would only eat once a week.  My teeth began to rot, I just didn't care about my life anymore.
   Then I was finally arrested on a warrant, I was sent to the infamous tent city jail in Phoenix. They didn't give me any medications for the withdrawal, and it took two long hellishly long months and I had no strength. 
   Once you are sentenced in a county jail, you're either going to prison or doing your time at the jail if it's under one year, but if you stay in the jail you are given a job.  At first I worked in the kitchen on an assembly line putting together the breakfast sacks all of the inmates ate. I was too weak to even stand for a few hours! It was embarrassing, but with each job there was a perk for each job. For kitchen workers, we had an inmate cook that was allowed to cook us things while we worked. We ate amazing. Cooked polish sausage, delicious sides like baked potato, ice cream, and soda!
  My time in tent City of course seemed to take forever, at this time I actually became pretty well acquainted with Jodi Arias, a murder who killed her ex bf in Mesa, AZ and overkill is an understatement. Watching her whole story go on was distracting for a bit.  I switched jobs from kitchen to an intake trustee do that's how I became acquainted with her. I was able to roam freely in the inside part of the jail (tent city was just outside the jail) without handcuffs or escort, my job was to bring each jail tower whatever they needed for the inmates and there were other various odds and ends I had to do, but mainly I was working in the intake room, I'd always see the inmates that were coming or going, she had to go to court like everyday for years. Anyways after that 3 months in jail I was released.
  I was so stupid, I immediately went back to using
 The good news is I stopped after 2 weeks after having to live in the homeless shelter. It was like 120°F outside and they kicked us out from 6am-4pm so I'd often be batteling heatstroke. I decided it was time to go to detox and a halfway house.
  It was a boot camp style halfway house for all girls, that worked for like 4 months then I left &amp; relapsed. My boss constantly glorified him getting high off heroin, so I ended up moving in with her and his GF then got back into heroin again real bad. After 6 months and being kicked out of where I was staying, I immediately went to that halfway house again. I had to go to detox though, for four days so I left.
  I went through a week long medical detox, then was set up with a Suboxone taper, and was being set up with a coed halfway house. My house managers were a couple, and I got along amazingly with the guy Isaac. I spent the next 10 weeks tapering off Suboxone and hanging out with Isaac all the time, then I was moved to a higher level house, and the owner was such a dick to me I ended up leaving after 7 months.
   I stupidly left with another guy, not Isaac, his name is Ben. He was an alcoholic and claimed to have a year clean, he relapsed the first day in our apartment. I relapsed shortly after and tried doing the Suboxone taper again, ended up relapsing again.
  After a couple months living there we broke up, and our landlord relapsed and disappeared. He disappeared for 2.5 years. And during that time it was hell for me Ben kept stealing my stuff &amp; harassing me. I called the police almost every day, he'd get so drunk then get violent. 
  That continued for a few years, then I moved out and got an apartment. I had to get a restraining order on Ben, I was single again but was loving it. 
  Then Glen got out of prison and claimed he needed a place to sober up, he was even saying he wanted to bring my son to live there too I as like absolutely! Well he just ended up back in prison not even 30 days after talking to me again.

  Then after awhile in AZ I decided to move back in with my parents. I stupidly started talking to Isaac again and he moved out here. Now it's just like every relationship I've had before I feel so stuck. Him and I are always fighting it stresses my parents old, they're old. 

I just wish and hope Isaac moves out soon, so I can continue with my life and doing things that make me happy. I also hope I've learned my lesson to stop going after the same guy, and make sure you're friends for awhile first.

So in the recent months I learned I'm addicted to being in a relationship, on top of the heroin addiction I went through.

Now things are slowly getting better, just celebrated 4 years relapse free in October.",4.19557321245296,5.3135489175675685,5.01181890751511,84.15604002736917,70.86036036036036,7.872505416809214,27.158741019500518,8.210359779756107,1.6759009579199455,8767,291,1757,125,158,2845,711,2220,0.133,0.7979999999999999,0.07,-0.9993,18,2,9,0,2,1,240.0,16,7,13,17,111,81,19,4,129,3,162,59,10,16,11,267,305,138,2,14,41,17,4,10,9,3,34,8,8,14,70,136,14,6,22,5,16,54,20,45,3,21,168,21,227,37,318,118,54,374,2,5,9,4,191,136,5,32,182,1189,297,25,0.023290110330509227,0.0,0.06818336413131497,0.1523379480579381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024890044968476376,0.09328672498615194,0.048243060745275713,0.0,0.07450037126729253,0.058137712580467085,0.2271134233134129,0.0,0.03167614735332014,0.04884342276733522,0.0,0.0,0.023097531208531502,0.0,0.0,0.038331552712001137,0.020733135984284688,0.02177310922523372,0.0,0.021881825319063464,0.12536060062012674,0.019446269297416798,0.014197435086489822,0.0,0.019818168493582696,0.026239978853228183,0.0,0.0205982099365948,0.02542676839522584,0.025870062197659426,0.0,0.0,0.023781806637891173,0.0,0.07123745905931964,0.023925358865587325,0.024637848571255037,0.08024947120971829,0.0,0.025168335304003368,0.0,0.0371905159307717,0.05154012819146031,0.0,0.1051413609429655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024333208248085283,0.0,0.11919207404875633,0.02038133249951251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054018267725466265,0.023831597250529087,0.0,0.0,0.1650249990547495,0.02406490981034112,0.0,0.13844608397135513,0.02106723817792584,0.07849168979070358,0.0,0.02093164941007832,0.0,0.021955843252865682,0.0262078491579218,0.02355235914524301,0.016638459473699876,0.0,0.07653953236642093,0.0,0.09905277974686386,0.0,0.051072807703058005,0.03598776293546961,0.0,0.19468994214138452,0.067025988140618,0.11912675779468425,0.03906927910686175,0.2421539747039045,0.025677428860698726,0.0,0.09224348357253664,0.020595367648498758,0.024792755524668912,0.041726728424516364,0.02299416218494308,0.02390237239609549,0.0,0.02624964701614435,0.0,0.015610870020084669,0.049214560559943034,0.0,0.04626466930927352,0.04587213448017643,0.21498928265070247,0.0,0.026291699681172183,0.0,0.0,0.11555920390025985,0.0,0.025767056363783014,0.0,0.0255992710972861,0.05695364522694716,0.0,0.049321728027103495,0.12652386510020694,0.0476314315323958,0.09870296218097696,0.11378371478573256,0.0,0.0822623764657645,0.08244405898187887,0.01955782691345291,0.0,0.02542390665151689,0.0396008378815439,0.021020233879901932,0.04407533105207373,0.04663898848885653,0.0,0.023398046230591142,0.0,0.0,0.046924671828221166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027277095733888243,0.1673094947867904,0.22278331304247315,0.01712091088736491,0.0345386434043123,0.0,0.0,0.04953859311407506,0.021856190829840725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775621189446362,0.0992128295800767,0.14203783361471378,0.07085271359567255,0.0,0.0,0.18102637926308324,0.05044183976651632,0.0,0.048439290014406715,0.02033602599916724,0.04866641649617057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0236944151519319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023412993653799282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05301848882033442,0.014920241055082948,0.02394611238216146,0.04599234842306417,0.15002917448695774,0.02638315486879579,0.0,0.02215422830591497,0.07408492212560358,0.0,0.0,0.07423681021066522,0.042404883459051086,0.0,0.05262239081426924,0.02390696356638909,0.0385316398775132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03585972956853476,0.023034514643452752,0.0,0.03296971993094887,0.07447247629361603,0.0743980487800266,0.05841472529523701,0.02667874269452945,0.0,0.18663122952849168,0.0,0.02642934120276765,0.021950653359370853,0.0,0.07004505791419803,0.056159125409891465,0.02035658298203165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10831040093046533,0.029846724572705305,0.04576483029875266,0.0369794921437107,0.2580323619286913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350467812596158,0.07906228055711045,0.025332952116054703,0.022751053607516808,0.0,0.05603027018390618,0.060345532501306386,0.0,0.0,0.013737110498885728,0.0739464220598218,0.11209153001601456,0.0,0.06282181865080441,0.15113115927008905,0.0,0.02600257644622364,0.026782477478092055,0.04490167049817121,0.0,0.06782191081794399,0.0,0.047469224313159565,0.03308925230576732,0.025464079503640498,0.0,0.19497487693562005

addiction,Killjoypowerguy,2019/04/14,"37 day streak broken. Again! (Coke) 37 days clean ruined and I’m not even sure why.

It wasn’t some huge craving, I was on my way back from a meal with my friends, and before I knew it I had half a gram in my wallet and I’m at home. I thought I’d just have that and then wait for it to wear off and go to sleep, just a nice end to the evening. 2 grams in 10 hours later, and I’m still awake at 7am. I stayed up the entire day waiting for it to clear from my system, before eventually passing out around 11pm. 

Anyone got any other tips that’s worked for them apart from speak to a friend etc?

addiction,throwawayperc1234,2019/04/14,"2 days without prescription narcotics I hate that I got like this.  I had to have a surgery a few months ago, and I was being prescribed 150 percs, 150 tramadols, Gabapentin, and I was buying percs from people because I would run out in a literal week.  I was able to cut 3 of my 4 dealers out right now.   I am behind on all of my bills, and I shouldn’t be because I have an amazing job.  

So far in the past 2 days, I’ve been drinking nothing but water and coconut water, taking Tagamets, ibuprofen, Imodium, and fish oil.  I even went back to my gym today.  My absolute worst fear is going back to my one dealer.  I have to drive right past his house to drive my wife to work.

Rehab is out of the question because I am the main source of income for my family.  I just don’t know where to find the will power to quit this absolute bullshit.  Sorry if I’m all over the place, I’m just venting...",3.8805311355311334,4.378594763736267,4.912912087912087,86.85292124542124,71.14285714285714,7.3853479853479875,28.353479853479854,7.1686216300943375,1.4038886446886445,685,24,145,6,12,225,113,182,0.105,0.8590000000000001,0.036000000000000004,-0.9325,3,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,3,8,6,2,1,9,0,18,5,0,0,2,20,26,8,0,3,5,1,0,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,3,8,3,0,3,2,2,5,3,4,0,1,7,1,22,2,24,14,5,28,0,0,0,0,3,12,0,2,12,97,25,2,0.16426429105077991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456103828763359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25261820077695546,0.0,0.3004019615355847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118737569640207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16091646916103008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10849501502561464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15485375445515007,0.18484299562344225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15013458612186706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093355182076231,0.0,0.13137715938187314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16217697967142874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18953893732671528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16300696247198646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09027535847917299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08025123529757809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13111418994398258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1576160174956519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11130973480927477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31361770539985473,0.11388017661150725,0.0,0.17162122227590687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.184013599625928,0.17471529322375448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2805616140650564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18388042531576124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12350630392693153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557033409967265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317629060116412,0.0,0.0,0.15227464349758302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15834491478805598,0.0,0.119586360263232,0.0,0.0,0.11668863938972182,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Liquid4TheCentipedes,2019/04/14,"Are we weak? Are we normal? Or are we unlucky? Is it a chemical imbalance or a ‘rough patch’ of your life? Do you think there’s life after death? 

Does it make us weak that we crave death but can’t manage to pull it off? Or is there some glimmer of hope inside us that still wants to survive? 

I’m not sure..I hope we all get better, but being 24 and spending half my life depressed, losing best friends to death, going through heroin addiction and heartbreak and family problems certainly makes me long for an ending to this life. I don’t believe in god, but i hope there’s life after death because it seems eminent that I’m not gonna be around much longer.

addiction,seraniteit,2019/04/14,"Addicted to gum. I realise this may sound stupid to some since a sugar-free chewing gum addiction is pretty much harmless compared to other addictions. Yet it is something I have been struggling with for a very long time so I could use some advice/help.

I've been chewing A LOT of gum in the past four years. I started consuming due to my nausea, it came to the point where I'd consume up to 50 gums a day. At this point I feel like the gum is doing more good than bad for me. It costs a shit ton of money and it started having laxative effects. So I decided it was time to quit, or at least cut down on the amount of gum I eat. Now the problem is that whenever I don't chew gum I feel unsafe, I seek control in chewing gum since I can't control my nausea. When I haven't chewed gum in an hour or even less I get this really sour/bitter taste in my mounth making me want to throw up, I get really bad anxiety and I'm not able to sleep without having gum in my mouth.

I tried to just get trough it, I expected the sour taste (which I never had before I started chewing gum) to go at some point but it didn't unfortunately.  Pepermints and anything with a minty taste have the same effect as gum, I prefer gum since it doesn't mess with my teeth. Replacing gum with something likewise would be useless.

addiction,Osculate,2019/04/14,"In love with a Coke Addict Its late and I just need someone to talk to. 

My husband is a good man. He treats me well and gets me flowers, cuddles, makes me laugh till I want to try. All around he is a good man. He is my best friend. He treats other people well and he treats me well. Of course he has his moments, especially, when he is using again. He is more self harming than harmful to anyone around him. He suffers for a hate for himself that I will never understand. Just because I see him as a robin Williams in a sense. He is hilarious, kind and intelligent but under that all, is fighting this battle that no one can see or quite understand. 

I have been with my husband for 8 years now. About 3 years ago he picked up coke and just couldnt shake it. Confessed to me that he has become an addict and needed help. Needed me by his side. I love him and I stay. I can deal with the coke aspect. I've done my fair share of recreational drugs (never coke though, as I didnt want to start something I was not sure if I could stop). The drugs are whatever.. its that addicts behavior that has me all twisted. I just can't deal with the sneaking around, the lies and hiding. 

Since then he has relapsed yearly. 

He just recently relapsed. I had left the house for a night out and was not due back home for a while. I came home a day early and I walked in on him... I could clearly see that he was high. 

Since he has relapsed, we have not openly spoken about his relapse. I asked him why he did it again and his answer to me was that he forgot what it felt like. I didnt understand his answer as I really cant grapse my head around how an addict can forget how it ""feels"" like. We are by no means in a stressful time right now. Frankly, I thought my/ our lives were going well. We have money. Our health is perfect. We WERE happy...  up until of course I came home and found him blasted out of his mind on coke. 

I feel completely blindsided. 

I feel the loss of trust slipping through my fingers again. An that loss of trust is manifesting in to unhealthy behaviors that I am seeing in myself. Such as a complete paranoia that everytime he goes to the bathroom he has done a bump. Or that his nose blowing is really due to the drips. An untrustworthiness is also turing into unwarranted jealousy. I am not trusting him to speak with other women when we go out. This paranoia that he is hiding something is really making me into this person I dont like. 

I don't want to leave him. We have this huge life together. Hes my best friend and really life would be a complete an utter scary place without him. 

I don't know what I need but some coping strategies would be nice to hear. Alanon is not something that has worked for me in the past. 

Maybe even to hear from any addicts or other individuals who are in love with addits going through the same thing. 

Even situations to share. 

Did you leave your partner? Or did your partner leave you? 

Maybe hearing other people stories may help me in mine.",2.233499926286303,4.39008317647059,3.2360106147722263,90.45427834291613,78.57983193277309,5.788883974642488,22.203302373581014,6.8360192770164,0.5387366946778718,2330,70,480,24,57,744,262,595,0.098,0.737,0.166,0.9903,1,0,5,0,2,0,73.0,8,4,0,7,30,40,3,2,28,0,63,22,3,6,8,103,104,34,0,13,18,2,5,3,4,4,10,4,3,7,32,38,5,2,14,0,1,7,18,10,4,1,21,14,80,30,71,74,8,68,1,3,4,4,80,30,0,7,33,337,112,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3417896744171495,0.0,0.0,0.055584385531127004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05014533403663856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04264169326961123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04384494102319498,0.0,0.0,0.22328372583892284,0.0586209070662657,0.0,0.0,0.04821643617300018,0.0,0.03822451420121078,0.06925297829820085,0.0,0.0,0.13161049924966006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434361114906102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19723566000601972,0.0,0.0,0.10013001613924707,0.0,0.0,0.040439673182572085,0.12929263692288934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12833840187892456,0.07349003948880825,0.0,0.14543627276463206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828324000564009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095116915252818,0.04479661478036418,0.06020683539551022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06875302656600908,0.09689177988957247,0.0,0.032760884329108265,0.0,0.1069104481977932,0.10518831077258577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06675086238229537,0.0,0.06190841328936199,0.06435363624001421,0.06665270634034262,0.21201998791320886,0.0,0.08405996141427187,0.06625149745604504,0.1886953158582707,0.0,0.0,0.0723533937444267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0652978272085919,0.034461143707922616,0.0,0.0707342084855627,0.1991872914278344,0.06812939448361541,0.0,0.08858108892214771,0.09190379519676492,0.0,0.055369849523615504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16978170146092308,0.0,0.08371242960257694,0.0,0.12599162383533655,0.06830435669875236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633143871751904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18598047566422826,0.0967242477018748,0.0,0.0,0.058844592116122474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04249067333516186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05985921849109418,0.08694379502460017,0.05475177099707719,0.06551359865875038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06669470971023275,0.0,0.0,0.16068225355387405,0.0,0.06191383037621296,0.0,0.0,0.05354990699623308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1998717366104012,0.0,0.06541520986002941,0.0,0.0,0.10374079590583933,0.07048328364289874,0.0,0.0,0.0531299212164513,0.1448206032068852,0.0,0.0,0.04438307060511738,0.06683541100541307,0.0,0.052424363579409286,0.07182860656062491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05909891863915358,0.0,0.0,0.05040007282256016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04165855545922927,0.0,0.06160755076581863,0.049780932752632574,0.03656391239844417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04257272172790147,0.0,0.0,0.19583500607756,0.0,0.054157168766134654,0.0,0.0,0.11095547304483228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255180586760729,0.0,0.056581699140557065,0.0,0.0,0.060445585106027135,0.0,0.045650139927047764,0.0,0.0,0.08908796461924615,0.0,0.0,0.1211402987213945
addiction,philbagg,2019/04/14,"I don’t think I ever adapted to adulthood... When I was a teenager, I hung around with my friends, outside, wandering, doing stuff. When we turned 18 (I.e. drinking age) everyone stopped doing that and started going to pubs/bars/clubs instead. I tried it, for years, and never enjoyed drinking the way everyone else did. I either get angry, sad, or sick, and I act like a total dickhead to everyone around me... unless I’m on drugs. It’s the only way I can feel comfortable in these settings, even though I know it fucks me up for days afterwards. I used to enjoy it, but these days it’s just to get by. I feel like I can’t drink if I can’t take drugs, and if I can’t drink, I don’t feel I can go out with all my friends unless it’s an odd meet-up here or there.

How did my life turn out like this and what can I do to fix it? I hate the days of recovery I have to endure just to get through a single social encounter.",4.6163352272727245,4.124793531250003,5.537064393939391,86.45301136363638,69.41666666666666,8.440151515151515,29.43371212121212,7.686295010490155,1.6116291666666664,706,23,158,7,11,233,109,192,0.122,0.7759999999999999,0.102,-0.3718,0,0,6,0,0,0,35.0,1,0,0,0,13,11,2,0,7,0,15,9,0,2,4,34,33,16,0,2,10,0,3,3,2,0,4,0,0,0,13,12,4,1,5,4,0,3,6,3,0,0,3,3,25,8,24,30,4,25,0,1,0,1,4,7,1,4,15,110,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21738158207062008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362242953932452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784280361339673,0.2831838007471908,0.0,0.10199503911044168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806428596769147,0.1104422786897109,0.0,0.35000215871966506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18520530720855885,0.08722497759992293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18866120513617785,0.11287522916157293,0.19136942037499888,0.0,0.13877925813474334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205439292430273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06710043834180184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623959126034103,0.17894893434893064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941674988225175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285905293763992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124460883670517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08641975199081525,0.0,0.0,0.10207722081956426,0.0,0.0,0.1397700210407146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09180054525493617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07823380182523529,0.11995810982329227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828947615191598,0.26560946755384085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105451223394049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19382728965856985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786254340439822

my mom is an amazing mother, does everything for my sisters and i, really big heart, and cares about everyone. i do not feel unsafe with her at all but drugs have really became a problem that’s made me kinda uncomfortable. recently she got back together with her ex boyfriend. about a month ago i found some needles and meth. didn’t talk to her about it because didn’t really feel like it was my place. i’m pretty sure she does adderall regularly. then yesterday, i heard her and her boyfriend in her room, heard them cutting some drug with a credit card and then i hear them snorting it. then she came out and she wasn’t high or anything so i’m thinking it was adderall? but that’s when i really thought i needed to do something. went to work and that’s all i could think about. i was going to text her a text regarding the situation, but decided i couldn’t do it. i really want to confront her about it because i really don’t want to lose her. i love her so much and i want her to be okay. her boyfriend goes back to jail in a few days i think? i was thinking about confronting her then. i’m sure if she knew that i knew and had a problem with she would try to stop. 

please just give me advice or share similar stories. thank you.

addiction,IntroExtroVertLsd,2019/04/15,"First night that I “won’t” be smoking before bed.. I absolutely despise idiots who say stopping weed is a cake walk. Drugs effect everybody differently. I’ve been smoking since my freshman year of high school In 2015. I read that smoking earlier in your life sets in addiction even more so. So yea. I’m applying to a gas station soon and the manager told me about the saliva test. FUCK. I felt the cravings after I got out the shower from the gym. I usually only smoke once a day now too. If I don’t let myself go too early in the day, then it’s just bowl after bowl after bowl.. I’ve been smoking every day, every week, every month and always before bed. Helps me stay asleep. Or maybe that’s just what I’m telling myself. I have no idea what sleeping sober is like. I just have to stay clean for a week to try to get this job. I might find an excuse later to smoke. Some plan to stop a day or two before I turn in the application or something. Idk. Sometimes I’d crave so hard that without thinking I’d start grinding up weed. I just wanna talk to some people about their problems with weed",1.678790513833988,3.9839460727272784,3.1049802371541517,89.8381225296443,81.45454545454545,5.462450592885375,21.383399209486164,6.7026698264267655,0.4773043478260872,856,26,173,9,23,279,138,220,0.09,0.866,0.044,-0.8313,3,0,4,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,1,3,14,5,3,0,13,1,11,6,2,1,0,25,22,10,0,3,9,0,2,1,0,2,3,1,4,0,9,4,0,2,5,2,0,2,4,4,0,2,5,3,19,1,25,13,3,35,0,0,0,1,9,8,1,7,23,102,28,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391027265849162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10221008018869253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3135752768577965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3168783651134667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12833833956793264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245172102959122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113256562990942,0.0,0.31048597357932045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117942617158729,0.0,0.11227063436025968,0.10448494216376872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11356066705263383,0.06417717212384094,0.0,0.06981099947222248,0.0,0.09824383178622917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11003766924211217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233493574552109,0.12978385177231105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386678257588944,0.0,0.0,0.12189659661108193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12560897789941772,0.08676328351769916,0.0600118688690432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12340610295825173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13031046154055276,0.0,0.0,0.09804718325658678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11527404079987487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13081721163037785,0.0,0.09342294205560024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851595891359382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11753825381555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287006823560875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09768477501695354,0.0,0.1243174267130936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1016118925275441,0.0,0.12292553813303575,0.0,0.0,0.09456579057023816,0.1214887626799714,0.0,0.08694453827909644,0.2618554269153822,0.0,0.2053941750240994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09873158844230763,0.10736480091548756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07870887870907492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11737585210767755,0.0,0.0833981422071791,0.13361119412538766,0.11999373093926012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13528741051440818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19706458618496334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11841031763691015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910288912509404
addiction,wh0kn0wswh0cares000,2019/04/15,"I'm scared Recently, I've been getting deeper and deeper into my addiction with cocaine. I just ran out of what I had tonight and I'm not able to get any till Thursday. As much as I don't want to get anymore, I feel like the urge just overpowers all logical reasoning. I'm scared what will happen in the next few days. I've been diagnosed with MDD and anxiety for almost 10 years and I know the next few days are probably going to be the worst. Not many people know what's going on and the ones that do, don't know how bad it has actually become. It also doesn't help that my roommate/friend has been high out of his mind on benzos and becomes verbally/emotionally abusive.

addiction,Arkodios,2019/04/15,"Masturbation Addiction Just to start off, I'm 14. I know at this age, y'all are probably gonna say it's normal and all boys do it, but the issue is, I'm cranking it anywhere between 5-10 time a day, everyday, and I have been since I was about 11. It kinda went down in 2018, but it's been on a rise. On late 2017 and early 2018, I was doing it anywhere between 8-15 times a day, and then as I thought I was getting closer to the end of puberty, I thought my hormones were regulating and I would be able to stop. It went down to maybe just 2-5 times a day, which is not bad considering my previous history. Then, after I got my first girlfriend near the end of 2018, I've been jerking it nonstop. To anything. I just can't quit. Especially lately that my depression has been peaking, and I need the dopamine. I got home at 5 pm and I've already done it about 5 or 6 times (It's 9:57 pm right now). I wanna quit, though, because I dont think it's healthy for me to be jerking off so much, especially not in my later years. It's not even a porn addiction. I don't use porn all that much (compared to other sources, at least). I use whatever I can think of, or photos I can do it to. It's getting out of hand.",2.246101591187273,3.10114892635659,4.341448388412893,88.12213586291311,75.24031007751938,7.602121583027338,27.532435740514074,8.032893268588372,1.5301674418604656,925,36,215,14,19,320,136,258,0.047,0.917,0.035,-0.3944,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,1,0,3,9,4,2,0,9,0,25,5,1,2,2,33,43,16,0,4,10,0,1,0,1,2,2,1,1,1,19,8,0,1,5,0,0,3,6,4,0,1,15,2,25,0,33,24,5,41,0,1,0,2,4,15,0,3,23,140,44,0,0.12640763992524756,0.0,0.0,0.2756059719739116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13949397398260194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040227170295321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554509928693466,0.07705692402513586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24456741092595044,0.0,0.10887471504068648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293589034387047,0.1481488125574126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22391929839691094,0.0,0.0,0.08349105399178056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075222739450428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13208554915601234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20219947441178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679716949399636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13193673434606376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06947033305753744,0.0,0.2851866475298449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12699346464651087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18584831998904103,0.09372966329918148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238526482435128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13628881571676096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26890016976891273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795143381655113,0.0,0.1005244288997164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456570600667273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08947197815564234,0.0,0.0,0.10568244713693924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16199382309461474,0.12419486441991236,0.2007070924604975,0.2948372455348971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21835122963557832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23436229726931304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08979636059052643,0.0,0.0,0.08140237567458808
addiction,idontknowwhoeyeam,2019/04/15,"I’m struggling to get back to sobriety. From Meth. Hi, I’m currently struggling with a meth addiction. 
I was able to quit for a year with help and motivation from my last partner. 

I’m currently struggling to find the strength to power myself through this. Honestly the work it takes to do it again feels like too much to bare. 

I use then reflect and feel like shit. I use that shame to motivate myself to better in those moments and set myself for some positive change. Truthfully tho I don’t know what next for me. I got myself into this situation and beyond my addiction my life is filled with debt and past trauma and self pity. I don’t have anything going for me. Other than my friends and family but I’m fuck up and Other than comical relief. I don’t have anything to offer. I’m looking for help to get through the next two weeks. Can someone offer me advice? 

How do you deal with crippling doubt. Self shame and regrowth? From going to isolation to people? From suppressing your problems to facing your demons?

addiction,PolarDawg11,2019/04/15,"Struggling with XTC and Speed   

So ever since I got emotionally destroyed by my ex, I got the idea of experimenting with drugs just to have something else to do instead of thinking of her. In November last year I tried xtc for the first time. My mind was blown away by the intensity of the feelings I was experiencing during the roll. This encouraged me to experiment even more. From November to today I had tried LSD, speed, synthetic cocaine, Adderall and xtc. Furthermore, I had always habitually smoked pot but at the time I started to notice I was smoking far more than usual, quantity and frequency wise. During the November to New Year period I started going to parties. This was a fun and interesting experience even though I had witnessed a lot of fucked up things done right in front of me. I was constantly surrounded by friends who knew what they were doing so I wasn't that afraid. On New Year’s Eve I took a pill and a half, suddenly I did not feel like it was enough so I compensated with speed. Consequently after that night, everything of the sort seemed natural to me, I had gotten used to that type of environment. Fast forward to today, I'm sitting here writing this having realized how much these experiences have changed me. I now have to use in order to have fun at a party. As parties come and go, I have bigger and bigger memory gaps. I’ve started stealing money from family and have become completely irresponsible regarding work and school. I constantly lie to my family and to myself. I've tried quitting, but I always convince myself that I can reward myself after a hard week. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I've stopped pursuing my dreams and have become a complete asshole to people who do not deserve it. This Saturday I destroyed myself to the point that during the comedown I hit up the ex who tortured me mentally. Now I'm here struggling with feelings of disappointment, depression and failed expectations.

addiction,playboy576,2019/04/15,"I smoked heroin. How do I forget about it? Some context here: 
So basically a little over a month ago, a guy that I liked (I am a girl) and trusted, who’s also addicted to smoking heroin and speed, persuaded me to smoke his dope. I had refused it several times, but one day when I was coming down off of coke and felt like shit, I did it. Then we began a romance in which I would constantly go over to his place and smoke it. I never bought it myself, only used semi frequently for about two weeks, and would maybe hit it like 4 times over hours, and I haven’t done it in over a month.

I hate myself for trying it because that’s not the type of person I am. I have slight cravings, or I smell it, but it’s never more than “Oh, that felt good”. It scares me a lot. I just need some sort of reassurance that my experimentation was relatively normal. And if anyone has any similar experiences, please feel free to share them. I just want to forget about that god damn evil drug.",3.1398646362098157,4.421117842639596,4.566517766497462,85.71481895093065,73.61928934010152,7.4868358714043985,22.270389170896784,8.021203637495839,0.9139897800338416,753,18,161,11,15,251,123,197,0.149,0.6829999999999999,0.168,0.4607,0,0,4,0,0,0,27.0,1,0,1,0,10,14,4,1,8,0,13,4,1,3,2,36,25,16,0,6,7,0,3,3,0,2,2,0,0,3,18,9,1,1,3,0,2,2,4,5,0,2,9,4,25,10,22,13,4,28,0,0,0,0,11,10,2,6,19,114,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16665669374773226,0.0,0.0,0.1355147713636154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225435996088835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10396047844682578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10689399732380203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319139274394928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13168857514473956,0.0,0.16520394041165345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09859195191222746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564445574203114,0.0,0.0,0.1772868680957056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14954142408655502,0.0,0.0,0.07729836895819008,0.0,0.29356861482548696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08688258285409073,0.12822458814885512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137062880214314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15093275552527274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15055142264440893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22406151789811135,0.1532212597360027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299691533550393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15358383415262425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24404728731294364,0.0,0.0,0.11335513290697755,0.2358137845258196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14978538179222434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10359229173948524,0.11626859040813844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334848565388379,0.15972220001382484,0.1678112236717601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15305489191395688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17270562815126805,0.15692434707102326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17828568874111864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10379232577920007,0.0,0.14933700060332114,0.0,0.0,0.13203521587791253,0.0,0.0,0.09016984066980517,0.0,0.12262738226255272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2171965209522074,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,starzinthesky,2019/04/15,"My SO is an addict who just admitted to me he has been abusing opiates the past 6 months... A little long, trying to condense the situation. I am looking for some advice on supporting my SO &amp; him getting clean again. We havent talked much about the details since Friday when he finally admitted he has been smoking opiates (as I reacted purely on emotion which wasnt very productive for the situation).  I wish I could remember the exact name of the drug, but however I am ignorant to opiates - I have always stuck to weed and psychedelics. He did say it was more expensive than heroin.  

I have been dating this man for well over a year now. I found out a shortly into the relationship he was a recovering addict, and had been clean for a short while. As the relationship deepened, I found out more about his drug use and past. He began using in his mid20s after his dad passed away. He has never shot up anything - but smoked crack for awhile, heroin, etc. He smokes weed every day, occasionally drinks and does a little bit of Coke here and there, and was being honest about his drug use - or so I thought. 

About 6 months ago he started his own business. It's a very physically demanding job, which caused a very fast onset of extreme carpal tunnel. This man would literally whimper in his sleep sometimes because of the pain. He had stopped complaining of the pain a few months into it, which was odd to me. I did start to find tin foil, little bags, straws, etc around my apartment but he claimed he was smoking hash oil. He had told me he would be honest about his drug use so I chose to believe him although a huge part of me knew he was lying. I think part of me didnt want to believe he had relapsed. He finally admitted to me a few nights ago (after many chances I gave him to be honest) he has been smoking an opiate to deal with the pain and its now costing him $20 per day to keep up. He says he kept this from me because he was very frightened to lose me as I have said in the past (out of emotion) I would kick him out if he relapsed. I feel now as if that was a very immature response, and not the best way to go about supporting a recovering addict. 

I know I see the same response over and over.... to leave him. I know he lied and withheld the truth which makes me emotionally react to the situation, but I also knew he was an addict and that this could happen. He told me at one point in time he cant make a promise to never relapse again. He does say he has a plan, has gotten clean before and he can (and will) do it again. My question to everyone is how can I be there to support him, but not let it consume my life or overstep any boundaries? 

I truly love this man. He has been very understanding, patient and compassionate with my demons (not drug related, but past relationship abuse) and I want to do the same for him. We fit together so well, our relationship in every other aspect has been just so easy and effortless. This is our biggest obstacle. 

Any advice on how to cope as a girlfriend/partner and any insight concerning this particular aspect of addiction will be helpful!",5.047178217821781,5.843266019801984,5.7402821782178215,80.89141336633664,68.66996699669967,8.634257425742575,30.16650165016501,8.769984970463412,2.2825024422442253,2432,91,476,39,40,792,267,606,0.108,0.7809999999999999,0.111,0.2845,2,0,8,0,1,0,75.0,4,0,0,3,30,19,0,0,36,0,59,18,1,11,5,93,101,44,0,10,15,1,1,0,0,5,14,4,3,3,21,28,2,5,17,1,2,2,9,6,2,1,37,8,59,13,75,51,15,70,1,1,2,1,76,32,0,6,35,322,80,1,0.0,0.13444672278379208,0.0,0.3092552760226852,0.0,0.11088431511714436,0.10058679811959542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04537208195418879,0.04720923336728115,0.061473870265106326,0.0,0.11574810132567268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046689226415808936,0.05050742856951631,0.0,0.0,0.05330571941026902,0.0,0.0,0.06917197080506864,0.0,0.048278501155202866,0.12784499736070828,0.059541355867968285,0.0,0.0619414588053121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058283915892880137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905988041683949,0.0,0.0,0.0731805740689515,0.058492741460774114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930081934068836,0.0,0.0,0.05558007635817137,0.3289810813787422,0.0,0.0,0.1914624546993164,0.0,0.0,0.12655217658660384,0.0,0.0,0.095605735148063,0.05421406561471275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028687630710415093,0.0,0.0,0.12430391513280638,0.05185604558788473,0.0,0.0,0.1244170775160158,0.0,0.0,0.02964242949475505,0.0,0.03224460600757749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050171814874408964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038029215794710025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0563021266147733,0.05042992294854404,0.0,0.0,0.062361687945224224,0.0,0.0,0.06007565997594999,0.0,0.058016817321069815,0.040074600193414,0.0,0.1705943466414622,0.0,0.05020993234169322,0.04764429011389937,0.06347352370888842,0.0,0.0,0.05120681994312894,0.0,0.07574398076074695,0.0575218087454628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358593696478734,0.0,0.04170778527397342,0.0,0.08751722524133981,0.0,0.0,0.053243271928406416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03844605584725032,0.0,0.1811146029030519,0.0,0.0,0.12287999368997568,0.21664527073304368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05363424081175204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06355775745934583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2436546604908903,0.06427128587707298,0.0,0.05396931291638183,0.13535719759808673,0.0,0.0,0.045211568474083814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0469329398662835,0.19132228650681704,0.05677737856978134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056113754516900496,0.0,0.0803166378511943,0.0,0.0,0.047434174413580096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19315139744657628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04560257257298296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03635439690678202,0.0,0.0450423674305992,0.03308345356112013,0.0,0.0,0.1084281312294255,0.0,0.03852029418808719,0.0,0.0,0.05906459770685735,0.0,0.1960081468691409,0.0,0.28088085237668325,0.06692920239368806,0.045034716805367664,0.0,0.0,0.10202568231895902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06524406482283937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12091174112679015,0.0,0.0,0.036536384139789234

addiction,joepecor,2019/04/16,"This may not be as serious as other addictions but i still suffer Hello. I starting watching porn in first grade at the age of 8 and continue to watch it to this day (i am now 15). I've tried to to stop but anytime i tried porn has just come back to haunt me and i relapse, then i feel like shit afterwards then i try to stop but then i just relapse again. I have come close to giving up but i am just trying to not give up. If you ask the question ""Why did you start porn?' I will answer ""My Mom died when i was 11 and I used it as a way to cope with that"" then at the age of 14 I suffered with depression which i always joked around about but deep down i feel bad about it. If you ask ""Why does this post matter"" All im asking for is someone to care about my journey of being mentally fine again.

addiction,michaelmichael861,2019/04/16,"Strange side effects, please give any advice. For roughly the past four years, I had not been able to go more than a few days without drinking. I drank pretty heavily, and also smoked a lot of pot.This began to affect my focus, which caused me to go on Adderall 2 years ago. I also smoked cigarettes pretty heavily. I'm recently, as of the past two months, completely sober of everything but marijuana, which I tried to quit a week ago. This is the longest I've ever gone without drinking as in every other time I tried to quit I barely lasted 3-4 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to discuss two side effects that are one bad and the other maybe bad/strange and definitely would like some of your advice on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never gone this long without using alcohol, by the way, the adderall and cigarettes are just an added bonus. It's an amazing feeling I have, but I want to address the fact that I have substituted alcohol with working out. I find this bizarre, but cool at the same time. I also experienced intense anger issues 3 days ago when I tried to quit marijuana.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked out for four hours straight one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced any strange substitutions like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question to summarize, is do you, or is it common for people to experience weird substitutes and/or the intense anger that came three days ago when I tried to quit marijuana?

&amp;#x200B;

Weed's the last thing I need to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very proud of myself and don't want to screw this up. I've never felt or looked this amazing.",5.58486008836524,7.139272326460482,5.709818360333824,78.80711340206187,68.00343642611685,8.291998036327932,31.726558664703003,8.704169506293173,2.6285465881197845,1241,52,219,20,21,392,153,291,0.09,0.76,0.15,0.9479,0,0,8,0,0,0,62.0,0,2,0,11,7,12,3,0,15,1,14,6,0,5,4,41,33,17,0,5,10,0,3,2,0,1,2,0,1,0,16,9,5,0,6,2,1,5,7,5,0,7,8,7,24,7,36,24,5,45,0,0,1,1,5,10,1,6,31,137,40,2,0.05366392656777355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10487953591816436,0.1902793320251324,0.11470083451748883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287450680640176,0.0,0.40701389410941663,0.4564528121251969,0.07298662056107914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037523065204629016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896142742807614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061377235760373315,0.0,0.055127634994008884,0.0,0.0,0.05626560600738163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17304396565168026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10514043593240124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04854209389832842,0.04521417263952352,0.0,0.048229676929154496,0.052493617483452736,0.0,0.0,0.027134093693246063,0.0,0.05152578513254145,0.0,0.049047856678943694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05147932827378096,0.060996892308277526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0591168652389799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052848157894437024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05601119701092423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748652516320628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052434967702761716,0.0,0.0,0.047490886307192566,0.045064182711658886,0.0,0.0,0.04562315132774667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05391262715930466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042834034202673336,0.0,0.0,0.039791121576859566,0.0827778568904017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272813095131803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10245658021760012,0.03720380976359495,0.0,0.0,0.05890687639671546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10919101169855326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060115879322456066,0.28539095764057937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05298665342133669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035651928280628034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06258373427106903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14573713418745216,0.0,0.10484371716641558,0.0,0.0,0.04634840251774357,0.0,0.044278359559455,0.09495712282220133,0.042595927059323455,0.04304596493451697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15519033062894505,0.0,0.07813595535123975,0.0,0.0,0.03812131374047476,0.0,0.4564528121251969,0.06911561853740313

addiction,CaitlinNoGoYea,2019/04/16,"Haven't done anything in 2 days because Im out of money. But decided I'll try and stop.

Don't have a choice because I won't have money until the first. I have a low tolerance I think, just need something to put me to sleep. Been up all night. It  4 am here. 

I started back a few months ago, after 2 years. I've been feeling unfavorable since November, and thought it would help. Yet I'm still whatever, can't explain it. Just a junkie.

Honestly, I keep this attittude like, I'm important or mean something. In reality, I'm just trash. I see it now.

Yet, still don't want anything in life, or to do with it. Just need to rest in peace, I'm tired and exhausted with myself.

addiction,PMPicsOfDucks,2019/04/16,"Well, here goes. How tough of a withdrawal am I looking at? Alright, fuck the cliches, but I’ve had enough. I have been using meth daily for three, almost four months now. I do not remember the majority of it. I am at uh maybe .5 grams once a week, with a .2-3 daily. If at most, I experience an hour of fuzzy feeling. There is nothing comparable to what made me mesmerized with this drug three years ago.
I am bipolar 1, ultra rapid cycling, while sober. This is moreso of a stop before my life blows up kind of deal than it is a my life is blowing up deal. 
I’m extremely worried about the comedown, due to depression and mania. I have a history of substance abuse, starting with adderall when I was twelve. I’m 28 now, and have jack shit to show for my life. I deliver pizza full time, and scrape by with help from my family. I take abilify, lithium, and Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin has been dodgy since I learned it kills the high. But there’s no high so I guess I should take all my medicine. 

It’s need to stop this as I’m forgetting much, much more. Like what I’m doing in the moment. I understand it may not be hardcore or anything, years on end, but I have a fucked psyche already. I never stayed up longer than 36 hours, I sleep 8+ hours a night, supplement with shit. Idk. I just know where this can and will go, and I regret thinking I’m different, as like I’ve said, I’ve had substance abuse problems before, but this is different. Way different. It feels like I need it to function, which to a degree I do, I started taking it with the intent to treat adhd meagerly. The issue is I know well that I’m slowly using more each day.

addiction,speckled_egg_,2019/04/16,"Having cravings A few years back I had a period where I did a lot of different drugs but it was usually alone and just a way to cope with my depression and feeling alone. 
I also was struggling heavily with binge eating and drugs felt like a replacement addiction. Why do I always feel like I have to be addicted to something? It’s like something in my soul seeks and needs this feeling of oblivion and loss of control otherwise I get wound too tight... 
that being said I struggled a lot with binge eating lately and gained some weight and feel isolated and idk man... those cravings are coming back. I just feel alone in the world I guess. I’m not sure what I’m looking for with this post- maybe some thoughts on what I said about addiction and if that rings true for anyone else- I feel like my mind obsesses and I feel like I need to be addicted to SOMETHING because I just can’t cope with life and feelings...",3.6873220973782783,5.654717207865176,4.086314606741578,86.90156928838955,73.5505617977528,7.6680149812734095,27.03520599250936,8.447377352677275,1.881016779026218,725,27,142,13,15,227,101,178,0.165,0.696,0.139,-0.605,1,3,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,3,9,12,0,3,7,0,12,11,0,1,2,45,32,14,0,3,6,0,11,5,0,0,8,3,0,1,9,17,3,2,10,0,0,1,2,5,0,0,8,15,17,7,19,21,5,14,1,2,1,0,3,5,0,6,11,91,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4203434556403077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995115401409991,0.0,0.07708784294443191,0.08020919055507493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06740232152077022,0.09876908915927657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482451410665136,0.0,0.05876210427110098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303661482160146,0.0,0.0,0.1081163059095394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08302572985680433,0.0,0.0,0.10071329867780528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22357750264684564,0.19727433780135106,0.0805264851538515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3899256944629893,0.20659595579368195,0.09255527279485797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05036292916181938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10619105705805207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10873888187781787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06808734254006599,0.2354710717767233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08094835844666701,0.0,0.0,0.16390485680280606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09684273419572813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09733247626026204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14295281878329494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923207175782915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18338933276712266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22263104094537248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015480490666928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085208515935184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07652765305857577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616657055370636,0.0,0.0,0.07651465453237036,0.0,0.11738435354547228,0.0,0.0,0.08698239269259732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06207586077203325

Hello people of reddit, this is my first post, and well as you all are about to see i don’t write much therefore my grammar sucks, but bear with me.  So i have been playing video games ever since i was a kid, all throughout my childhood my mother and my 2 older sisters did a great job limiting my play time. But ever since i was 17, i joined the marine corps, and we basically became an adult. I had control over all my off duty time, and my playtime increased tremendously, now it’s to the point where i don’t even pay attention to my lovely wife, i kind of set her aside, also stopped caring about my  fitness level ( the marine corps requires you to maintain a high fitness level. My wife at times gets so frustrated to the point of depression,  she knows i love her to death, but i know i cant keep doing this, i need to get my life back.",5.648628571428571,5.3895144628571465,6.069285714285716,82.71821428571431,67.22857142857143,8.6,30.07142857142857,7.908726449838941,1.8768857142857127,681,22,138,7,10,220,113,175,0.119,0.6970000000000001,0.184,0.9299,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,2,0,4,12,12,2,0,8,0,13,4,0,2,5,26,24,11,1,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,6,0,6,3,4,1,1,3,4,1,1,5,1,32,8,17,19,5,25,0,2,1,2,17,11,1,0,11,95,35,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13431341040253006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12914689081779399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17124113454127146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1883756142625644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14465924200609673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11093257585315024,0.303849504028646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14286228571849038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17549892473865342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18517078409046347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17745349070951075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666692448933813,0.14928596277320347,0.0,0.17489910143689633,0.1846071554494345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23726291546109685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30317156833906217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234661192347295,0.12453637229984305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164387260294276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.317543189005543,0.0,0.16085429239066273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13383824787967635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778679285655057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14041775163742942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29380742194116183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15101155546201894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,MontyCristox,2019/04/17,"My brother is addicted to Lexapro. How can I help? As the title states my brother is addicted to Lexapro. He has been taking it DAILY for about two years now. I am really worried about about him, and his insistence on taking drugs every day. I know these drugs are extremely dangerous and change who you are as a person. 


On top of him taking it every day he is also using classic addict excuses such as he ""needs it or he won't feel good"" or that ""there could be negative side effects if he suddenly stops"". 

Right now I am just really disappointed in my brother. I used to always look up to him, but now that he is addicted and reliant on drugs I can't look at him the same.

addiction,e_demarco,2019/04/17,"My younger brother is an addict I came here for advice. I feel like I’m at a loss. My 23 year old brother is addicted to heroin. My family has spent the last year trying to “help” him. It started out with everyone giving him money when he needed “gas” or “cigarettes” or “groceries” or “bills.” Over time, we all started catching on to what he was doing. He would get $40 from my dad and then turn around and get $40 from my mom for the same reasons. I stopped giving him cash altogether. My youngest brother stopped giving him cash also. My step dad cut him off when he stole my step dads wallet. His girlfriend found the wallet in the center console of his car. A few weeks later $1300 went missing from my mom’s house. (I’ve told my mom multiple times not to pull out that much cash at one time because it’s not safe to have in an envelope in her bedroom). After that money went missing, my mom cut him off. He called my grandparents who are out of state and gave them some sob story about how he hadn’t eaten in 4 days and needed money to pay his bills so my grandparents sent him $2000+. I still live at home with my dad and my youngest brother. My brother who is an addict lives in an apartment with his girlfriend. Two weeks ago my brother overdosed and was rescued by EMS and taken to the ER. He survived but still continues using. His girlfriend has taken him to NA meetings but he uses when he comes home from the meetings. Last night his girlfriend kicked him out and he’s staying on our couch. I’m not comfortable in my own space anymore. Last week he came into my room when I wasn’t home and emptied out my change jar that maybe had $20 of change in it. It wasn’t the amount of money. It was the principal. He stole from me. He lies to me. I had to put a dead bolt on my bedroom door because I don’t want him going in my room when I’m not home and stealing any expensive things to sell or pawn to get money for his addiction. I don’t know what to do. Even when he wasn’t living here he would come over and eat everything in our kitchen and take home food, that myself, my dad, or my youngest brother had just bought. He’s draining all of us. Financially, mentally, emotionally. 4 days ago, I told him that I didn’t want anything to do with him and not to come into our house unless he was sober. I love him so much. And it’s breaking my heart to see him do this to himself and to his family. I want to help him but I’m at a loss. Everything I’ve heard and read is telling me that he has to want to help himself first. On a side note, my dad is having a triple bypass open heart surgery next week. And I’m worried about that too but my brother doesn’t seem to care. All he seems to care about right now is when he can get his next fix. He’s better than this. He’s a good person. This drug is consuming him and turning him into the worst person imaginable. His family loves and supports him but we no longer want to enable him. My dad is the only one that hasn’t cut him off (who is a recovering alcoholic, 11 years sober) so he feels like he can help him because he knows what it’s like to be an addict. Which is I’m sure the reason my dad is allowing him to stay on our couch. Any advice you can offer I would appreciate. I just can’t do it anymore.",2.389619761681616,3.8325399528718727,3.6141234435667435,91.13970973356541,75.83357879234168,6.528756192261348,23.685660731021557,7.13173024886023,0.7228860677466864,2544,77,562,27,55,828,269,679,0.07,0.8190000000000001,0.111,0.9843,2,0,3,0,0,0,68.0,7,1,1,6,25,23,3,0,24,0,46,15,2,6,4,91,106,43,1,10,18,20,2,3,4,3,7,1,13,2,27,40,5,3,10,1,15,15,16,10,1,4,27,4,91,13,82,75,12,99,0,5,1,2,117,40,1,8,43,342,118,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3209441804145519,0.0,0.11507540338128393,0.10438867170902999,0.06292573992017401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04708700800118548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08008201723028653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167879964433127,0.0,0.0,0.04845393649844169,0.05241645502565608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076796898821392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052075341885999465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060123948398772775,0.13468805142433626,0.12006593605376932,0.0,0.12457629974963673,0.15216195954456352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759465761389409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06828311218674138,0.060249826481568035,0.0,0.0662330501346325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03889025728060142,0.0,0.0,0.05626319162418552,0.10583665305121223,0.0,0.16652292320175416,0.0,0.05954387097159255,0.08412900618222421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05008403532107384,0.07119897799820096,0.06455983142228164,0.0,0.0,0.12305129098579955,0.16945167849117695,0.0334633535795618,0.04938647758693792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13954822159610072,0.15786641575868904,0.0,0.2953115518555438,0.0,0.0,0.13588122985350928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06471876918077178,0.14398729578816505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08629865216587297,0.0,0.1559786527080251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10628456251189393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059153744945464215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05933806492556028,0.0,0.0,0.27584223879100683,0.0,0.0,0.08656842420809405,0.08731883348575686,0.0,0.0,0.12524093991214796,0.05525570490314943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06178556500242625,0.0,0.07979839854478488,0.044781552564555176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282500370362548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05919153425707305,0.0,0.0,0.05889680091672471,0.0,0.0,0.12107867557230773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05028393862830855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04692042760203975,0.10720585966273084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833523613253184,0.1255183395717336,0.09404467276032707,0.098454082508139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06681731000860866,0.055494520243697935,0.0,0.044271084107970586,0.0,0.05146447296552138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03911783163700408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10300172102167517,0.0,0.0,0.11252638324837104,0.0,0.03997624359565074,0.1280909502802446,0.05751805125421496,0.0,0.07082643309232611,0.10170832792336418,0.0,0.0,0.17364730429422154,0.0,0.1889227192096386,0.0,0.0,0.10916630707014023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059796378500438674,0.0,0.12548183545165306,0.0,0.0,0.11375204343025395

addiction,kpinsforthewin,2019/04/17,"68 days clean Hey guys, just wanted to let everybody who is struggling that it gets better! 60 days ago I was in a hospital bed almost unable to move. I had to have a catheter inserted to get my suboxone and valium to detox me. I was puking, sweating, shaking, and shitting. I couldn’t stay awake for more than 2 hours a day and i was eating out of a trash bag filled with candy. I went to treatment and did what everyone told me to. I still deal with mental illness I am diagnosed bipolar 1 so I can be extremely depressed. When I wake up at 2 am from a nightmare instead of living in fear I say to myself only a few more hours until the sun comes up, signaling a new day and a new opportunity to do everything I can to better myself. 68 days isn’t too much but it’s something and my life is so much better than what it was when I was using. I still rip the juul like crazy and drink Red Bull but it beats doing heroin and meth and bars. I am so happy. This is my 8th time in rehab and it feels like it’s the one. But I could fuck this all up in a second so I’m always on guard ❤️",0.8758738244514106,2.6572771594827644,3.2727272727272734,90.38136363636364,81.2844827586207,6.114733542319749,20.028213166144198,7.1686216300943375,0.3998379310344826,839,22,187,11,22,290,137,232,0.112,0.7809999999999999,0.107,0.3522,0,0,3,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,5,11,13,2,3,12,0,23,13,3,1,1,26,33,20,0,3,4,0,1,2,0,0,6,1,2,1,12,14,3,1,1,2,0,5,2,6,0,2,9,3,23,7,29,20,6,32,0,1,1,1,6,10,2,1,18,131,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140104960202227,0.0,0.12879054005498755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701897691461823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412517160134664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107914629628282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10268956558092764,0.0,0.0,0.414734025966596,0.13259764884048633,0.11077693971694727,0.13054272989965784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12599490575100647,0.0,0.13160647587206953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12289828541231156,0.11559194224755258,0.0,0.0,0.14472897605653767,0.06503221233964762,0.09188343493113016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11890359916828402,0.13439330620399295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12735025340019085,0.0,0.13691433047724144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533220873196671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13151877272055715,0.09084542169104327,0.12567075179361298,0.0,0.11357045595507012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12961487303718788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13669866011357873,0.1890954032093521,0.0,0.0,0.2484366438925381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871536618941703,0.09781841145889322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022807600106507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320226752197476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09901503001725016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13708775023114114,0.2054261178713115,0.0,0.0,0.13445757188787644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499713722034679,0.0,0.0,0.12289828541231156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11108309672003554,0.0,0.0,0.07586116374903995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11922850069837605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,saambee25,2019/04/17,"Let's talk SA (sex addiction) for a minute; do you believe it? So long story short, someone very close to me is claiming that this is what he's dealing with... but when I think SA I think going out and hooking up with multiple people on the daily. As I've been learning, there's a lot of other forms (exhibitionism, voyeurism, etc). Can I get some insight on this please? Personal experiences from people who have had this impact their relationships and marriages would be helpful!

addiction,decoy4000,2019/04/17,"Sister 20 year heroine addiction I have posted a few times here, and everyone was accommodating and carried us through hard times, one thread over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/8puazp/best_friend_addicted_to_heroin/e0es3ek/?context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My sister now nearly 40 years of age has been addicted to various substances for almost 20 years now. And recently heroine. In South Africa, she has two rehab sessions with her private health fund, and she uses these up very quickly. My parents then would have added a few dozen other rehab sessions over the years. Last year January we kicked her out of the house, gave her a few thousand dollars as my mum could not just put her out into the street.

My Mum is very sensitive but also tired; she already lost a son to drugs and our dad past away one year after my brother due to a heart attack.

My sister spent the money on rehab and then finally just before she ran out three months later she booked herself into a psychiatric hospital where according to her, she made a lot of progress and begged us to move back in with my mum and her son now 13.

My Mum agreed, and we said she could move back in for a couple of weeks, but she only eats and sleeps there until she has a job and on her own feet. Few months passed, I flew over to visit the family and my sister was still living there but getting herself sorted.

I believe she was clean for nearly six months at that time. My Mum confirmed this as she can see my sister's attitude change when she is using — fighting with everyone and very demanding and takes over the house.

While I was there, we had a chat, and she said she wants to get out of there quickly and be on her own and raise her son properly.

She did find an outstanding job, they offered her more money than what she asked for. She had excellent prospects, and they provided her training in different areas. Then suddenly she messaged me that she has been let go as her boss is migrating overseas. Two days later Mum let me know that this is not the case but that she was fired due to substance abuse.

She is in the second round of rehab now since the job incident, and my Mum has asked she needs to leave the house at the end of April. But our concern is that she might become violent and that my Mum will not get her to go. Can be very stubborn and will just sit there and ignore everyone while she is being talked to.

As I am typing this, my Mum called her in rehab and confirmed that she needs to be out at the end of the month. And she just said okay we will talk again. Which means that she has to find a way to soften my Mum so she can keep staying there.

It was suggested by a friend of the family we need to pay for an apartment and let her live there and pay the rent. And then from another friend whose sister is also an addict, he keeps paying the rent, and their Mum ensures that there is food. And she keeps abusing.

Any advice would be welcome, I have cut my sister out. This might sound bad, but I believe that after 20 years of love and support from her family and all the money we have spent trying to keep her clean she has no intention of becoming sober. And she will always go back, every time harder than the time before until she overdoses. 

Everytime leaving us with the pain and trying to protect and raise her kid.",7.726321839080462,6.999237379310343,7.005172413793107,79.27373563218393,63.13793103448275,10.115778474399164,31.402298850574713,9.259372276320047,2.4870631138975967,2640,77,505,38,33,814,278,638,0.092,0.8240000000000001,0.084,-0.5313,8,0,1,0,3,0,74.0,11,0,3,3,29,16,5,0,34,1,53,18,3,5,1,94,87,56,0,8,13,24,3,0,2,8,12,4,4,1,20,52,2,7,4,2,12,10,4,9,0,9,21,8,91,7,79,48,10,100,0,1,2,1,112,33,0,5,53,375,111,12,0.0,0.14367967579988206,0.0,0.19829578681422072,0.0,0.05924957528694736,0.0,0.0,0.0607148933219693,0.0,0.06690969509504638,0.0969759007964367,0.050451265784141816,0.06569550798243239,0.07367537029218288,0.04123231698172073,0.06357867538470932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336678431739472,0.06897845247842742,0.056966420040327224,0.13986841709901274,0.05062577407785361,0.0,0.133928112801027,0.10318792828053984,0.13662458550932965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191276854183087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414135978762857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09682055866624101,0.06708893222287868,0.0,0.03910307718688314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06334826924980265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031468545768163,0.06204239177537005,0.0,0.0,0.10740515560552212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05108566704438505,0.17381143720048714,0.0,0.0,0.17147734764055714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664201620431418,0.1108343835247337,0.0,0.07331730471160308,0.0,0.09368935131328544,0.0,0.09503425382654328,0.0,0.10337688658087923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05431499209229123,0.0,0.0,0.06444972759731148,0.0,0.07185004456793008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20988599444521894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18050580478328504,0.21557252805669236,0.0,0.0,0.033322147690845,0.049423745193680375,0.0,0.12840255485720195,0.0,0.18600313933357995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070795745540856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06618775738578866,0.051547755541754885,0.05472338139475015,0.057372129278938325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0660467882649153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12864343159695385,0.0,0.0,0.19358577912207764,0.12888593467359494,0.0,0.13487514220847518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08217257699617217,0.04611390257479711,0.0645174705363463,0.0,0.06732544088930137,0.0,0.05788077540677305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05806936870565864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06095261302181575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0598674790769578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17302675489021874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04831641386459765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050155998187974414,0.0,0.06067649085647175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06462639358045133,0.04842135465375726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880527243009851,0.0,0.0,0.045588246555155656,0.09746853931818804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17677708253425833,0.06968837225811615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233125011995691,0.0,0.11845868041334633,0.0,0.21880102731800108,0.10473437512338113,0.0,0.20011331860564327,0.03576273895844291,0.04812741713861076,0.0486358967525759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614346464179631,0.0,0.07367537029218288,0.2733183080693433

addiction,prototype1B,2019/04/18,"Does this sound like heroin? Apologies if this comes off naive, I've never used drugs nor have any desire to. So As of 2-3 years ago I have been having increasing suspicions that my mother may have a drug addiction. I'm wondering if anyone can confirm my suspicion that it's likely heroin. 

-Sleeps for long periods
-Awake at random times and acts wired/chatty
-70% of the time is a ragey and nasty person (get agitated at every little thing), otherwise is normal and nice
-Doesn't have a job (just hustling) 
-Has a sketchy boyfriend who has twice come over and had scary drunken arguments with my mom (his ""job"" is also hustling) 
-One argument I was present for he said my mom was a dopehead
-Months later I happened across small white baggies in her bedroom, a spoon and a straw (first time seeing such items, they were gone later that day) 
-Has random as people over for a few minutes then they leave
-Has had people damage her cars in the past
-Has had people break into her house and steal money
-Asks to borrow money occasionally (for seemingly legit reasons) 
-Frequent runny nose (I assumed she's always had bad allergies like me but idk now)
-Sometimes has bruised arms but idk how frequent since I never paid attention. She doesn't seem concerned about hiding her arms tho
-Has had previous issues with alcohol addiction (DUIs) but got clean, years ago 
-Has since gone back to her old ways of drinking again 
-Pretty good at hiding the drug usage otherwise


I don't live with her so I'm not concerned about my safety or anything. But I no longer visit/speak to her due to feeling unsafe when I stay over and not wanting to walk on eggshells when I'm around her. 
Honestly if she is doing drugs I wouldn't even know how to confront her.",4.473597640891222,6.713534235474008,4.517548055919615,83.4748279816514,72.08868501529052,6.9955875928353,26.969091306247268,7.83500028581142,1.7351494975972033,1393,50,245,19,28,431,206,327,0.125,0.797,0.079,-0.6787,2,0,6,0,0,0,49.0,0,0,2,1,17,10,1,0,11,0,33,12,4,4,2,45,54,27,0,7,11,3,1,3,0,2,7,2,2,1,8,14,2,0,8,1,4,8,10,4,0,3,14,6,30,6,34,38,3,54,0,1,2,0,24,15,0,11,31,157,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22196391141700186,0.0,0.0,0.18048713214111808,0.10879807310612256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0814130393279512,0.08470951755428663,0.0,0.0,0.06923056587144844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0711840887378473,0.0,0.08377644716016716,0.09062760824234334,0.09517348531249273,0.0,0.0,0.07828139327056821,0.08500252335185761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17539116233941196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0656554945035706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08908982310359775,0.0,0.0,0.09972967400894396,0.4722436981134262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724092652860915,0.0,0.08577470043633688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051475425121794434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659487426328777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05318866083044526,0.0,0.0,0.08538880282971326,0.08142237612897052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002540244128794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746874965718372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062574711472881,0.20205055844534167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055949102780517686,0.0,0.0,0.10779628920737908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14920964106601364,0.10203487588300462,0.08989525792280527,0.09009379821969256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2384644511118328,0.08125939805437149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.157035846572797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09974681624854777,0.0,0.0,0.10682672029863467,0.0,0.06898537871497945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097183935510235,0.2117353111603759,0.08889178168008925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10357179808922257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10467200396228574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09683941326298913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811250232240914,0.18535802633051104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16842750495637568,0.0,0.10187804383997054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10068727522655947,0.0,0.0,0.10851007475008193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06763440066965834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17808910611124787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792642018151307,0.0,0.0,0.0600469446406204,0.08080769081966396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040266123646343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311175485346747
addiction,_Qwertydude_,2019/04/18,"Nicotine addiction from vaping Hello, I’m currently super addicted to vaping. It’s effecting my health negatively, it’s very false that vaping is 100% safe. From vaping I lost so much weight, my mouth is  fucked up from the heat created from the vapor, and I’ve been having thyroid issues. It’s such a hard thing to stop, I have tried to stop so many times but can’t seem to stick with it. I feel guilty using it, but when I don’t use it for more than a couple of hours the cravings become unbearable. I just need solid advice to get me through quitting, is anyone in this sub familiar with vaping addiction and how to stop? I don’t want to ween myself off bc I want to quit as soon as possible.

addiction,sarahslilbox,2019/04/18,"How to help my friend with an addicted parent So, I’m on mobile, so forgive my formatting. This is a long story so I will try to keep it short and sweet. My best friend and roommate has a drug-addicted father. He abuses mostly prescription pills (Benzos mostly, some opiates). Her mom told her about it but basically swore her to secrecy. My friend, who I will call B, recently found her father’s drug stash (she wasn’t snooping, it was in his open briefcase). She confronted her mom, telling her she can’t handle this and wants her dad to get help (she is getting married in a month, and wants her dad to walk her down the aisle sober). Her mom told her that the habits of her father are none of her business, and not to tell him that she discovered his stash or he will kick her (B’s mom) out of the house (wtf?). 

She is absolutely destroyed over this. Her younger brother is in rehab for Xanax addiction now, and is also an alcoholic. She blames her dad for her brother’s recent addiction. I’m a recovering addict, so I know how almost addicts think, and I’ve told her that her dad won’t get help unless he wants to and is ready to. She believes she can save him and save the whole family. She keeps asking for advice, and I’m running out of things to tell her. I never sugar coat things and i have told her that addiction is not that simple. 

How do I help my friend get through this mess? I can’t stand seeing her in such immense pain, as she is getting married and this should be the happiest time of her life. 

TL;DR My best friend/roommate is trying to “fix” her addicted father and broken family when she should be happily awaiting her marriage. How can I help her/make her realize he cannot be “fixed”?",4.2426429980276135,5.356787914201185,4.914334319526628,84.91319773175546,70.74556213017752,8.11854043392505,26.50936883629191,8.472884824447931,1.6814788954635116,1337,42,270,21,24,430,158,338,0.067,0.762,0.171,0.9906,1,0,3,0,1,0,48.0,0,0,0,2,13,14,2,0,11,0,29,15,0,4,1,45,51,27,0,5,5,15,0,0,4,6,14,0,0,0,16,17,2,2,5,0,0,2,9,4,0,0,7,3,56,10,32,35,7,22,0,0,1,0,82,11,0,5,8,181,72,0,0.0,0.08414216477642225,0.0,0.6193420347758016,0.0,0.06939586269210461,0.0,0.07589434195300339,0.07111211143593399,0.0,0.0,0.05679134629674919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06639022946775874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08001053957309838,0.149053497853148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07251511869593877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647116703749524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13389483850350253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786520950896346,0.2743333318408368,0.0,0.18551424201928102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23800212273395496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194275138106606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12624429360684156,0.0,0.0,0.03902845167346431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05016059213650068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062846788869696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326916015996653,0.056684170654550274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054771798334379417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556586701083963,0.0,0.07885469269631418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14023916079149534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056590434717616836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862129383602603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09435954490117952,0.04550408654879717,0.0,0.0,0.04140991082972634,0.0,0.0,0.27143473624053865,0.0,0.0964301955064397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256609575799147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928665580830452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Plinkywinks,2019/04/18,"Help My boyfriend and I have been together for six months.  The other day I walked out of our bedroom and caught him taking a hit from a meth pipe in the kitchen with our roommates. I was totally blind sided by it. I had no clue.  He told me he has been doing it the whole time we’ve been together, and he’s not using every day, but every couple days. I just don’t know where to turn or what to do...  I love him, I love his children, I love the life that we have been building together.  Now I’m afraid I’m never going to be able to trust him again and my heart is absolutely shattered. He says he’s going to quit and as far as I can tell he hasn’t used in 3 days now. Can anyone offer me some words of advice, or encouragement? Should I stay or should I go? Anything helps.  I myself don’t have an issue with addiction, I smoke a little pot, maybe drink a beer or two after a long day but that’s really the extent of any of my usage. I just want my boyfriend to be happy and healthy, and I am aware that I can’t want it for him, he has to want it for himself.  I am not ready to give up on him or on us.",2.1923235294117625,2.7809063500000017,3.9775490196078462,91.69058823529413,75.08333333333334,6.980392156862745,21.617647058823533,7.048011613610866,0.3237205882352936,844,18,204,8,17,286,132,240,0.044,0.777,0.179,0.9884,0,0,4,0,0,0,26.0,4,0,0,1,6,7,0,1,11,0,26,10,1,2,2,34,46,16,0,5,11,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,2,1,9,11,3,0,1,2,0,5,8,1,0,2,8,2,35,6,28,33,4,29,0,0,1,3,30,10,0,6,13,138,44,0,0.13080721397626482,0.0,0.0,0.14259917110408504,0.0,0.1278232955918032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889533910743575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09146344543141922,0.0,0.10764319160551564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14473569427176391,0.0,0.4217991580193807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12814127087027624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2204214388877623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12548219892851992,0.22302226246842094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13924671162799426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550071783740535,0.17535463646111674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13652874661010225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188822389717506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09239300366033612,0.0,0.13110319269234286,0.0,0.11576026810602312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541758530045587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13141342812370235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10440907022223883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008865874274455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13912957344198754,0.0,0.0,0.08379845078333786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10402314677105756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394230856450727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09835074575151263,0.0,0.11433127057659515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07627473839330973,0.0,0.0,0.12499189857432574,0.0,0.0,0.14228068656911275,0.12777964102323142,0.0,0.1573449725459909,0.225950868427035,0.0,0.0,0.23146045170375765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14604158300958084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,OnyxxRaiin,2019/04/18,"My Parents are Addicts, need advice. My parents are badly addicted to proscribed narcotics it has affected me my whole life. I have serve depression not just from the pain my parents are putting me through also from other childhood problems iv dealt with all my life. But every time I see them the look so much worse. I let me mother stay over at my place to spend some time together. The whole time she was nodding in and out, like she was about to overdosed. She would not sleep when she says she’s tired. She just don’t wanna sleep. Keep in mind this is the first time I had my mom over in awhile because of how her and my dad is. I’m not close to my dad for certain reason I don’t wanna talk about. So after what I seen happen was the last straw I’m going to end up taking the easy way out if I don’t do something. Rehab is out of the picture tried all my life. I need help someone point me in the right direction, what can I do? Do Involve the law? I don’t wanna see them in prison forever. I need help.

addiction,SecureKittenz,2019/04/18,"Relapsed and struggling, feel like an idiot After being on a methadone clinic for 2 years everything was and still is great, never touched drugs and never had a craving. 8 months ago I started a taper detox plan and nothing changed, and everything continued to work well. I got down to 25mg from an original starting point of 80mg. 

One day on a Saturday morning at 7:30am the clinic decided to not open on the upcoming Monday because of impending snow on Monday and DID NOT inform the people who already got their Sat&amp;Sun take homes on Friday that they were going to be closing/not opening, leaving many of us shit out of luck on that Monday with nowhere to go at no fault of our own. Naturally many people had a lapse that day, myself included to avoid sickness. It was unfortunate that I did everything correctly in the program and still got screwed over because of their ignorance in not realizing many people don't come on Saturdays and already have their take homes.

Anyway, I only used that day (first time in 2 years) and was fine after that for many weeks because I had told myself I would just do it to get through that day. A few weeks later after thinking about it every day since I gave into my urge, and have been using daily for 3 weeks straight and now my methadone dose is too low to sustain me, leading me to use. I NEED to stop this shit and I need to get back on track to how I was for 2 years straight. Unfortunately I'll have to hold the detox for now and request an increase in dose to a level that will hold and sustain me for the day. Once I again get stable on that dose I'll decide whether immediately beginning another detox is appropriate or if I again need some solid clean time before attempting it. 

I feel shitty because of what I've done.

addiction,throwaway531337,2019/04/18,"I feel severley addicted to being submissive to women Let me just briefly explain. I'm a 28 year old man.

I think it kind of started back when I was in 8th grade. In history class one day, one of the more popular girls (who completely ignored me usually) came up to me after class and was like ""hey, are you good in history?"" me ""yeah i'm pretty good with it"" her ""Do you think you could help me cheat on the test tomorrow? My parents are going to kill me if I fail the test. We'll just switch papers when the mr. so and so isn't looking and you can fill out my test and give it back to me"".

Well because i'm a big pushover I agreed to do it. Somehow we didn't get caught, she was pretty good at being sneaky about switching the papers and we were near the back of the class. Anyway I got her a pretty good grade, I think she did slightly better than I did on my own paper because the papers passed out varied a bit as an anti cheating measure and there were different questions on her test than mine. Then at lunch after we got the test back, she walked up to my table with me and all my unpopular friends and thanked me for ""helping"" her with the test. Although after that she went back to ignoring me.

Ok now fast forward to when i'm in college. I learned on the internet of something called homework slaves. Basically guys who do homework for girls sometimes even pay to do it for them. Immediately this excited me because it sort of reminded me of the girl who used me to cheat on the test in middle school. I figured it was a way to get the attention and appreciation from girls who mostly didn't like me.

I did the homework slave thing a few times with college girls I found online. Eventually that later morphed into just paying women just to pay attention to me. I got into financial domination and started paying women just to take my money and laugh at me basically.

Once shortly after college I was visiting family out of state, far from where I lived. I decided to take the opportunity to try to act this out in real life. Since this was an area where no one knew me and word wouldn't get out that i'm into weird stuff. I put an ad on craigslist and found a girl the same age as me to take shopping. I ended up spending quite a bit of money on her it was fun.

Ok so nowadays, I feel really addicted to all of this. I'm still big into financial domination. There's been one domme in particular that i've sort of been orbiting around for a few years now. And once in a while i'll send her some money or buy stuff on her amazon wishlist. I like reading her twitter feed, she usually says bratty things and talks about other guys she cleaned money out of. Within the past month or so I binged really hard on her. I did several phone sessions, and just texting online and I spent a couple thousand on her. Then just the other week I binged about another $1500. And she mocked me on her twitter about how I relapsed.

Anyway I feel like i'm legitimately addicted to this and that it's to some degree ruining my life. I don't know really where to turn. I want to start getting my credit cards paid off, but I usually can't stay away long enough to get them fully paid off before I slip and get back into findom. I don't know. Any helpful advice is appreciated.",3.4282084340585537,4.893847353120243,4.8262028829796755,83.40598710717165,73.18569254185692,7.831784403259021,26.428776076640702,8.435331408891425,1.7536173874115861,2569,89,518,44,51,857,282,657,0.055,0.8540000000000001,0.091,0.9596,2,0,1,0,0,1,61.0,4,4,2,4,39,31,5,0,33,3,35,7,0,2,2,87,82,38,1,4,11,1,4,4,1,2,5,1,4,13,29,40,2,2,18,2,15,12,8,10,1,5,29,6,87,21,100,47,13,105,0,2,1,0,60,52,0,10,44,362,116,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2340107060950788,0.0,0.06992097598988298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04865864154677348,0.07502978736156718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369753371500697,0.0,0.0,0.06722660320481308,0.33012004512638177,0.0,0.13085453171779438,0.0,0.06088651792698041,0.0,0.0,0.06328300614531014,0.1562351627217623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07306383517037994,0.08183781879574817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07502218716467415,0.0,0.0,0.057129421814781124,0.0791722741711567,0.0,0.04614590582081225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747578829344264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06337491256192836,0.07393360103144525,0.0,0.047260225307184385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06745400536131536,0.0,0.10853837006561952,0.051117632860513934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15690881944012114,0.055281838325068056,0.0,0.22430161728048853,0.06864036620098997,0.04066534243508119,0.24006177599150136,0.1716829335745794,0.0,0.0,0.14169786976039214,0.0,0.0,0.06409762837257707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14388184018741554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916303364395165,0.07451166509352344,0.07864755409094677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07316801274608298,0.10108030716400652,0.13982915106092167,0.0,0.06318280194535428,0.06332234581614637,0.06008668153993772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057113095530321414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07508306519234206,0.15240368273107166,0.19394524788912415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07945138025261388,0.0,0.06830564249435822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2183860380515841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07193074669275976,0.08015597929411054,0.07610565444334935,0.07157258079095304,0.08144322647842042,0.1375164700162892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056901990471270585,0.0,0.07241567612776535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083476893213055,0.0,0.05918956090513197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05508516258548963,0.07076796169292933,0.0,0.15193720683169545,0.07626620936887865,0.05714249190388426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638226301011253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613973438982334,0.05751176581798514,0.0,0.06587658917221169,0.0,0.0,0.0950735565133669,0.1375452376953588,0.0,0.0,0.041723256524886634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04857993778837054,0.07782935358819641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617990060928809,0.23641728025593625,0.0,0.042203941546170236,0.05679561350282316,0.057395675034188014,0.0,0.06433493570518868,0.0663305494595113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09215585217788322

addiction,spel-fu-bo,2019/04/18,"I feel like my life is falling apart. I started smoking weed when i was 14. i tried alot of other drugs till i was 18.

addiction,smegmary,2019/04/18,"My theory on how the cannabis dispensary saved my life from worse drug addiction Two years ago I moved in with some buddies, my roommate being a profound pot head. Coincidently at the same time I had broken up with my long term gf of two years. I felt like shit, but I was a free man so I did what I couldn’t do at home: was smoke weed all the time. 
The first year I had failed basically all my classes in school because I did not have my priorities in check. So I moved back home but the cannabis addiction came with me. 
Now I’m trying to kick this addiction to thc because I find myself constantly running from my withdrawal symptoms, but I can’t get completely sober. It’s better now that it used to be, I’m functioning. 
To conclude my theory - the dispensary saved me because on my worst nights - the dispensary only had thc, and not other harder drugs to offer when thc wasn’t getting me where I wanted.",7.407070142768467,6.296668055865923,7.592364990689013,76.05336436995655,63.97206703910614,11.307510862818127,34.41402855369336,10.504223727775694,3.3434948479205464,718,26,143,15,9,234,107,179,0.091,0.815,0.095,-0.0784,0,0,3,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,4,8,8,1,0,9,0,14,9,2,3,2,23,22,8,0,2,5,0,1,1,1,0,7,0,2,1,6,5,0,0,3,0,2,4,5,3,0,3,10,1,25,6,19,9,6,28,0,1,0,0,3,9,1,1,16,95,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4371720947469666,0.0,0.0,0.11849364329736907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10278680126371824,0.0,0.2444586860695113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11822349848895307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15288706773066865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401543000428104,0.14445374913361045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31003803789142603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12834768630164894,0.0,0.1221753129351452,0.11370275565475538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13967795109026954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371877505642775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26817118075570906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09441766652035423,0.06530620318195636,0.0,0.0,0.11829699173459607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28414791332639355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544368425701688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10166484981584008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13528489082217615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13721410160235015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13893812615734952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15589238423338375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09075564755140017,0.0,0.26115950464334425,0.0,0.0,0.11545113212011905,0.0,0.0,0.07884419409777503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13622489007863614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582443829947761
addiction,sadnuggettime,2019/04/19,"Advice for helping friend? i have a friend living in the uk, while i live all the way in the us. me and my friend group always knew she had a problem with staying up all night, but recently, it’s gotten a lot worse.

she’s started drinking coffee and became addicted to it, further worsening her insomnia. it hurts us to see her devolve into this, and we try to help her despite being on the other side of the world, but she’s stated that she was fully aware of her condition and that it’s a decision she’s made to keep staying up late. she’s also said she has her own personal reasons for doing this, but she’s never told us.

i don’t really know what to do. she seems stubborn in continuing on with her lifestyle: stay up late then drink coffee when she gets tired, and it continues on and on... she’s probably been awake for 3 days straight. i don’t know what to do, and i don’t know if this is the right subreddit either, but i’m a bit desperate.",5.379944055944059,4.933909912820514,6.451841491841493,80.38027972027972,67.82051282051282,9.757575757575758,30.547785547785548,9.339509955726095,2.4593589743589743,743,25,154,13,11,250,110,195,0.124,0.8059999999999999,0.07,-0.9287,0,0,2,0,0,0,23.0,4,0,0,0,2,6,1,0,11,0,13,5,0,2,3,32,27,16,0,2,6,0,0,0,3,0,3,1,0,1,13,11,2,2,7,2,0,0,4,3,0,0,8,2,28,3,24,18,6,33,0,1,1,0,30,16,0,3,12,111,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13141665575432307,0.0,0.11779949283092198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09640332335984424,0.1003067700193156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316087387970896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774439965914827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23618506547403276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794085362193587,0.0,0.06298209367248216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16160346316399374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12905064166860625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071498586714444,0.0,0.0,0.19875241699243199,0.0,0.27196998102571396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2128946834459592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248680146621736,0.0,0.11406677092549382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09297514023067988,0.0,0.0,0.11312745942830632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052590990838516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12997265806641764,0.11534950928697765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772270418830227,0.12394487575941318,0.11902800379878994,0.0,0.0,0.10294854145902303,0.1146700988912026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09606227590820213,0.10974365959795243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08532549616922935,0.38546890929085775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13855381863010702,0.0,0.11519013175070887,0.0,0.08184513949084206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4350183089772016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956865142532006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285015237532275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This person was already an alcoholic, drinking 15-20 beers 3 nights a week. They will start hitting the cocaine hard and frequently because it’s in their personality. 

It’s hard for me to tell this person not to do cocaine, because I don’t know anyone who has gone down that road and so I don’t know what the problems are or what it looks like.

addiction,damnifuckonyohoe,2019/04/19,"Tomorrow is 420 and I'm unsure of how to proceed. I've been trying to quit smoking cannabis for the better part of a year now. I know it's only weed but it messes with my head and keeps me depressed and unmotivated. But for some reason I find myself always going back to it, justifying smoking by saying that this is the last time, or I'll only smoke once a month, etc etc. 

1 week today I bought a gram, rolled a joint and told myself that that was it. Last time, for real this time. Then I realized 420 was coming up and my faith wavered, I sorta mentally decided that I was gonna buy some weed. 

A friend of mine just reached 1 year of sobriety, which makes me feel guilty about wanting to smoke tomorrow. I really don't know what to do. On the one hand I know there is strength to be gained from failure but on the other hand I'm thinking that if i power through the cravings I'll be that much stronger.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",3.7029241071428567,4.856837015625004,4.8773214285714275,84.52125000000002,72.07291666666666,7.5690476190476215,26.214285714285715,7.957251820313856,1.4413098214285711,745,24,153,10,14,246,117,192,0.083,0.741,0.175,0.9635,1,0,2,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,5,6,7,0,0,10,0,13,3,3,3,0,31,28,12,0,3,6,0,3,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,15,7,0,1,9,0,2,2,1,2,0,1,6,4,16,5,21,17,6,21,1,1,0,0,3,3,0,5,16,98,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516321178021946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911539432310698,0.0,0.0,0.10552216645520918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11931756019994187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372368750128874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336667929417058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336492710528518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3461152197771403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07845954037326149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14182424277105662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198853720583288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08818772774960994,0.0,0.0,0.1710774919789254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592510661427276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379238535082392,0.0,0.0,0.2558351414137534,0.25297150628132065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035784024222643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15637670929790035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12385667543820827,0.0,0.11406915041591766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652529362341129,0.10514844886945897,0.2360303402573409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16803597207636495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16504434322594153,0.0,0.17661951562795009,0.09940704862905532,0.15954248656320485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12339886851075255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09942784402957633,0.0,0.0,0.2714458283328969,0.0,0.1470847524491097,0.1482733346937543,0.0,0.10535148780839858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09152436655306093,0.0,0.1244694833690499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11022961696513307,0.0,0.0,0.19985114389164588

addiction,Missyplantlady,2019/04/19,"Recovery starts today I spent my holy week hiding coke from my boyfriend. We used to do it together on the weekends but he made the decision to stop 2 weeks ago. I don't even really want to do it, but there's a part of me saying that I need to do it just one last time. I don't really enjoy the high, I like the taste and feel of snorting it. I had two awful panic attacks. First one was earlier this week at 5 in the morning and left me laying on the grass outside trying to calm down. The second one just happened and left me on the floor literally convulsing. I'm still shaking and feel so weird and anxious. My body is clearly done. My brain wants better. It has to change. I can't risk losing my legal freedom, my boyfriend, my family, or my life.

addiction,moonchild_xo,2019/04/19,"I almost relapsed today. I’m a basket case. I wanted to post the image for my journal entry so you can see how messy my brain is right now. I have been clean 4 years, IV heroin addict and opiate junkie in general. 4 years with no opiates and this is the worst craving I have EVER felt since I got clean. Why 4 years? Why the fuck now? I am a methadone patient tapering off and have been doing great. I was at 15mg down from 80mg and now they upped my dose to 30mg to prevent relapse and help my body and especially my mental state. I feel like a failure. I got so far and now I feel like I’m taking 10 steps back. 

FYI: to those who think methadone/suboxone is not being clean, please understand everyone is different. It’s not for everyone and it is a bitch to get off of but please take negativity like that elsewhere, as I have not been high in 4 years. It can be a great tool if used correctly.

addiction,Ringedmouse,2019/04/19,"Help me please, I'm a different person drunk than sober Hello, please excuse the blocked text I'm on mobile, I'll try to fix it. 
I have known for a while that I am an alcoholic but have avoided it and let it begin causing troubles in my life. I am quite high functioning, currently engaged and about to graduate college with honors, but I am hardly ever sober after 3 in the afternoon. During high school I would smoke pot every day but turned to alcohol when I turned 21 and it became easily accessible. This drinking has caused many problems in my life, I often skip class because I'm too drunk to go, I've gained over 50 pounds, am sick often, and have a general dissatisfaction with my life. Also I am a college student and cannot afford to be spending all my money on alcohol. I don't enjoy things like playing guitar or hanging out with friends like I used to and recently have been to my own horror drunkenly texting another man whom I used to have casual sex with before my current relationship. I am so scared of cheating, sober me is strongly against it, and I do love my fiance but it's like when I drink, drunk me thinks cheating is OK which is completely different than what I truly believe. I realize this is a common sentiment from people who drink and then cheat but I would have never ever guessed it would be me. I wake up every morning with full intentions to quit, or to cut back. But once I have one or two beers my self control is completely gone. I wake up barely remembering the day before and feeling hungover every morning and guilty for my texts. I do not want to be this person! But i feel very alone. I have tried talking to friends but they just brush it off and don't believe I have a problem, but I know I do and I really need a support system of people who understand.",4.944661016949151,5.911999694915255,5.929166666666667,78.82476694915256,69.0,8.837853107344634,30.56920903954802,9.075114841892004,2.6070192090395485,1428,56,266,26,24,473,191,354,0.188,0.667,0.145,-0.9668,5,2,8,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,1,6,12,23,4,2,11,1,35,18,2,6,4,63,55,30,0,7,14,0,3,3,2,3,7,0,0,4,18,18,10,3,8,10,2,3,5,9,0,2,2,4,41,14,37,46,3,34,0,0,0,2,16,13,0,6,20,186,59,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875302124021331,0.0,0.09288410634711186,0.0,0.07171912707018863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940400050202532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896036848087264,0.0,0.05466966855161135,0.0,0.15262654081442625,0.20208311402280896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18425742835826603,0.0,0.0,0.18806095833906605,0.0,0.10058663967903538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11567569008668648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18739841691349599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26356435855823496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622460566248399,0.22668432566018856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069241452663647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13857707815605996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050968677124416606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987954731118104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803379765011981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06011234315221091,0.1895091400196358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049287200734702885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09170651454475713,0.19003637609976087,0.1314431360878659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08094203016889517,0.0,0.0,0.0909240601938495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649849693388858,0.0691687346885622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09550902110430623,0.06077123741953298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12434921819002655,0.1566147398116115,0.0,0.1968890840076237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17162823491378892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.190776926807293,0.0,0.0,0.057452957398461964,0.0,0.08855072866618759,0.09628552848111342,0.10159288091378106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08978790814006805,0.09076355919526947,0.0,0.0,0.09355849030433533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10177072934587274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208346093510751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05958112135334461,0.0574649762369316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12177717021871967,0.1950977887458637,0.08760684957147435,0.0933627289257904,0.0,0.15491390946412487,0.0,0.07399752107300159,0.052897109460679465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19112379579375768,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,scootbatoot,2019/04/20,"Interview (drug addiction) Hey all, I'm currently taking a drug related class in college and would like to interview someone who has dealt with/is dealing with drug addiction in some way. It is just 10 general questions and 100% anonymous. I figured Reddit would be a simple way to complete this and perhaps someone here could benefit from putting their thoughts down on paper. PM me if interested, I only need one but I'd be very interested to read responses from anyone who's willing.

addiction,newsoberliving,2019/04/20,"I am admitting today that I am a sex addict. Let me say before I say any of this I am in therapy, have bipolar II, and am on medication. I am an alcoholic, compulsive user of drugs, a former two pack a day smoker, and bulimic. I am in recovery and now have identified some of the root causes of my compulsive behavior. This is all stuff I am too embarrassed to talk to anyone about.

It all started when I was 9 years old and was molested and sexually embarrassed by a neighbor who was a teenager. I had some prior knowledge of sex and used to read about it all of the time in magazines my parents had in the bathroom. It was one of my greatest thrills to read about masturbation and sex techniques in Cosmo and Maxim when I was a little kid. When I discovered masturbation at 11 I never stopped doing it and that continues to this day. I spend hours on porn websites everyday and spent a tremendous amount of time just circulating through naked pictures ""building my collection"". I have masturbated from 4-10 times a day since I was 11 and I feel out of control every time I log onto the computer and shift the internet into incognito mode. I tried crossdressing when I was a teenager for a long time and it was exciting until I finished and felt ashamed. I sniffed any girls panties I could find and waited around in friend's bathrooms, my girlfriend's dorm room, and laundromats just hoping to find a pair I could sniff. I am not proud of any of this, but I couldn't stop myself no matter what I did. 

In adulthood I was trapped in an unhappy relationship for too long and it was largely sexless. I fantasized constantly about every girl I saw and tried to be stealthy about trying to have sex with any girl who would listen, but thankfully I never acted on it. By the end of the relationship I had developed intense feelings of wanting to be abused during sex. I started to go on online chat rooms and flirted with men until they often sent me pictures of themselves. I eventually ended up cruising for gay sex going as far as having a man pick me up to go to a public place for sex, but I declined once we got there. I am not gay nor am I bi, trust me I have tried to explore it over and over again and I would not be ashamed if I was. My taste in porn has finally grown to the point that I seek out sissy training videos and gay porn (which I try to convince myself to enjoy because the feelings are so intense inside of me). My sexual tastes are slowly crawling toward being overly abusive as a dom and a sissy as a sub, but I always stop myself before I get to either place. Any time I have any difficulty in life I end up in a room alone watching hours of porn until I cum and feel the shame and anxiety all over again. I try to inhabit the role of the embarrassment I was when I was 9 years old and every time I go toward that feeling I feel intense shame. 

I hate myself. I want to change. I have had enough. I am powerless to this. This is the first day in my life that I am recognizing myself as a sex addict. I am proud of myself for this.",5.6310497894929465,5.702293481054369,6.634927237781437,77.5249260937214,67.23723228995058,9.709848068826652,32.3471078162182,9.516144504307137,2.8768136921105616,2401,94,466,45,36,805,267,607,0.119,0.821,0.06,-0.9915,2,2,3,0,1,0,47.0,1,0,1,4,21,20,2,7,33,0,55,26,0,5,6,83,82,46,0,9,11,1,7,0,3,2,8,3,5,6,25,33,3,5,12,5,2,9,8,9,0,3,23,15,78,11,93,49,10,97,0,0,2,16,25,39,0,5,49,349,103,4,0.0,0.17620797333119131,0.0,0.16212591665047216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07946781627485819,0.0,0.07701413743321722,0.0,0.0,0.06187315809508673,0.0,0.0,0.3034025363984391,0.0,0.05688490340608104,0.0,0.0,0.051993973091735896,0.0,0.0,0.06619582420552149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04532893228824338,0.0,0.1265491142942374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638780986730091,0.07866261495903294,0.0,0.0,0.08035632914346638,0.08340063329281958,0.11874020681348199,0.0,0.0,0.19182320516119866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623354800142473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19758164843993029,0.0768333618481319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1879535530557728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255907394017319,0.0,0.07139689338016629,0.08145732565719603,0.1359266854381456,0.0632502521582999,0.0,0.0,0.05745005556882516,0.0,0.038849830756255456,0.0,0.1690411356354143,0.0,0.05947217852441272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341472698107403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07385587782872285,0.14645848810731962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07603774631019926,0.1050447929994546,0.0,0.07452787111762063,0.0,0.13161184201200293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490949100987827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147014413742552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15605581862938034,0.07919056517539286,0.05038800086124867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256755471285979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15537994606966554,0.0,0.07029387313362773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487594793597855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15966880050636334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826750388902632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061511043520277274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526423915362487,0.0,0.0,0.18650390802376954,0.0,0.0,0.08512397098119795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0597674433812425,0.0,0.06846034472251007,0.08503670244318129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3035178342370896,0.0,0.07048422219031847,0.0,0.0,0.3029117927367899,0.0,0.07263854084761298,0.0,0.0,0.0642228341477608,0.0,0.0,0.08771845729129685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564587674459752,0.0,0.0,0.09577031063040922
addiction,PrecautionaryCramp,2019/04/20,"So deep in debt. Im an alcoholic. Ive been one for over 15 years. I managed to stay sober for 4 years, but then fell off the wagon hard. For the past two years, ive at it worse than ever. With the help of my family, i was able to start my path to sobriety again. Currently, Im 2 months sober. Every day... hell, sometimes every minute is a struggle not to drink.

With that said, im trying my best to stay on track and dig myself out of the mess that I have made. Because of my drinking, im over $20,000+ in debt. Bill collectors are calling left and right and Im sure that legal action is around the corner. Ive got a full time job and im working on getting another.

I have steal expensive bikes, motorbikes and eletric car charger... And then i sell it on a website of my country for easy money. But now i cant stop. I live in small city so its very easy to steal and when i see a bycicle alone i start thinking about stealing. I have make around 1500 euro with this and i use almost all of it on online games because my parents cant find it there.
